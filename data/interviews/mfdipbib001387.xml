                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good morning. I'm David Reuther with the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training with another interview in our oral history
                        series. Today, the 31st of August, 2004, we're with David Lambertson, a
                        career Foreign Service Officer who capped his service as Ambassador to
                        Thailand. We're also enjoying a beautiful morning in Winchester, Kansas.
                        Good morning David.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Good morning, David.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a pleasure to be here with you. Let's start off with
                        your personal adventure as a career Foreign Service Officer. I can tell that
                        you've had a number of very interesting assignments at interesting periods
                        in this country's history. Before we get into that let me ask about your
                        background. You're from Kansas here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I am. I grew up about 60 miles from where we're sitting right
                    now, near the town of Fairview. My dad was a farmer. I grew up on a farm and as
                    you can see I've sort of reverted to form.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's certainly beautiful. How much acreage do you
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We have 80 acres here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't stay in Kansas. Now, growing up on a farm
                        in Kansas, how did you find or get a sense of the outside world out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: How did I find the Foreign Service? My family was interested in the
                    world around them. My parents were avid newspaper readers and led me to become
                    one, too. I always started with the sports pagstill do as a matter of facbut I
                    read about world events. The Korean War, the French War in Indochinthose were
                    big stories at the time I began to be aware of the world. My grandfather on my
                    Dad's side, William P. Lambertson, was a Congressman for many years, although he
                    was defeated before I became interested in that kind of thing. He had also been
                    Speaker of the State Legislature, and an unsuccessful candidate for governor a
                    couple of times. My grandfather on my Mother's side, Willis Shattuck, was a
                    Democratic state legislator and judge for much of his life. So politics was part
                    of the conversation, especially when those two grandfathers were together at our
                    breakfast table, as happened sometimes. An aunt and uncle (an army officer), and
                    cousins lived in Korea prior to the Korean War, and in Germany, and I was always
                    intrigued with their lives. In my teens, I began to pay attention to the career
                    of Bernard Rogers, a Fairview boy who had been Captain of Cadets at West
                    Point—appointed there by my grandfather—and a Rhodes Scholar, and who was to
                    become the NATO Commander. I suppose I secretly wanted to emulate him. I was
                    very pleased that General Rogers and his wife were able to attend my swearing in
                    as ambassador, by the way.</p>
                <p>I had a normal small town, rural upbringing. I worked every summer for Dad on the
                    farthe year-round for that matter. I went to the Baptist Church. I played
                    football in the fall, basketball in the winter, and participated in track and
                    field in the spring, for a high school with an enrollment of about 65. I had two
                    brothers and a sister, and we had wonderful parents. I was not sophisticated
                    about anything, but I was certainly not unaware of the world and its
                    possibilities. My mother tells me I was always interested in going to faraway
                    places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your first adventure of going to a far away place
                        was when you left for university.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. I graduated from the University of Redlands in California. I
                    had a checkered college career by the way. We don't need to go into it in
                    detail, but I had a scholarship from the American Baptist Convention, the
                    Northern Baptists, given to young men who it was thought might have the
                    potential to be preachers. It was a reasonably good scholarship for those days
                    and I used it at the University of Redlands, which was affiliated with the
                    American Baptist Convention. That's how I got out to California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's my point, Redlands is out in California, a little
                        bit further than the Oregon Trail which passes us by here very closely. How
                        did you pick Redlands? Was that on a scholarship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Redlands was a place where that scholarship was applicable and it was
                    in California, which intrigued me for a combination of probably not very logical
                    reasons; so that's where I ended up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you arrived at Redlands in 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I arrived there only in 1960. I had done a couple of other things. I
                    bounced around a bit during those years, but I nevertheless graduated from
                    college four years after I graduated from high school and joined the Foreign
                    Service six months after that. So I didn't waste a lot of time, but I didn't
                    have a very straight path.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major at Redlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were telling me last night that you went from Redlands
                        to my alma mater, Occidental College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. Occidental had a brand new world affairs program, a
                    masters degree program in world affairs and they were offering scholarships. I
                    got one and spent one semester at Occidental, the fall semester of 1962. Then I
                    joined the Foreign Service in February of '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we were at Occidental at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pass the Foreign Service exam while at Oxy or
                        while at Redlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: While at Redlands in the fall of 1961. I saw an advertisement for the
                    exam on the political science department bulletin board. I had never considered
                    the Foreign Service and was not at all familiar really with what it was, but I
                    signed up for the exam which was given, I think, early in December in the main
                    post office in Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe that exam at that time? It's changed over
                        the years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't remember much about the details. It was an all day affair. It
                    seemed to me that it was fairly comprehensive. I later took the graduate record
                    exam, I believe it's called, and to me they seemed somewhat similar. The GRE was
                    easier I thought. It was a hot day in downtown L.A. in early December. The room
                    was not air-conditioned. They had all the windows open. A big bunch of people
                    were taking it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like the Chinese examination system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I remember we had three people from Redlands who took the exam and
                    two of us passed. The other was Les Janka who did not join the Foreign Service.
                    He decided to go in a different direction, but he also ended up in Washington.
                    He was a deputy White House spokesman in the first Bush administration as I
                    recall. He may have also had a Pentagon job in that administration. He was a
                    very political guy and I think made his way up the ladder in the Republican
                    Party. He's probably in New York City right now (for the Convention).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, at that time after the written exam, I believe it was
                        followed by an oral exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The oral exam was in the spring. It was also some place in Los
                    Angeles, I can't recall where. There were three elderly white men sitting across
                    the table from me and I thought it was pretty easy. I particularly remember that
                    one of them was interested in sports. He wanted to make sure that I was a
                    well-rounded person I guess. Sports were and still are a favorite subject of
                    mine, so we had an easy conversation about various sports figures. I recall also
                    being asked some details about my home state of Kansas, including how large it
                    was in area. I happened to know that, as everybody should know about their own
                    state. So I suppose I got pretty high marks for being a real American. In any
                    event, I thought the oral exam went smoothly and to me it seemed rather
                    easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did all three of those people participate sort of
                        serially. In my circumstance, one interviewer didn't participate until the
                        very end, which of course created a different emotional environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall anything like that. I just remember all of them
                    sitting across the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time you went, were you, were there a bunch of
                        people in the waiting room and you all were called in serially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's the way I remember it. I don't know if we were given a
                    particular hour to show up. I presume we were, but we waited outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you passed the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: In the spring of 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The spring of '62, now when did you actually come onboard
                        because they have the security clearance process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: February of '63 after I had done my semester at Occidental.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were actually fairly committed, even though you
                        were just responding to a poster on the board.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I was excited about the possibility of living and working overseas
                    and I had nothing else in mind to do with my life. I certainly didn't want to go
                    to graduate school, that's what I was doing, but I regarded that strictly as a
                    sort of filler. I wanted to get a job and start making the big bucks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went into government. This was the start of the
                        Kennedy administration so you had the whole Peace Corps, activist
                        atmosphere; there was a renewed environment of interest in the outside world
                        if you will.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think that's right. It was a good time to be a young person
                    starting out in government. There was a certain spirit of adventure that maybe
                    isn't always there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when you finished up one semester to Oxy, you then
                        went back to Washington to take the A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right, February 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that on your nickel, or did they pay for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think maybe they paid for it. I drove my '56 Ford back there, but I
                    think I may have gotten mileage and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd never been to the East Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Actually I had been to Washington, D.C. I visited there in the summer
                    of '61, but I didn't have much experience there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find accommodations, how did you get
                        settled?</hi>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: I first stayed with an aunt who lives therthe one who had lived in
                    Korea. Shortly after I got started I found an apartment off Columbia Road in a
                    neighborhood that was either coming up or going down. I think at that time it
                    might have been going down.</p>

                        course. This should be an interesting collection of people in February of
                        '63. Who else was in your A-100 course that you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't remember a lot of them personally and our careers diverged
                    greatly. Rich Brown is the one I remember best and we ended up being housemates
                    for a year. Rich died of a heart attack just a few months ago. His career was
                    primarily in Latin America, although we did go to Vietnam at the same time. Rich
                    was from Oklahoma and New Mexico and had gotten a degree at GW (George
                    Washington University).</p>
                <p>Mel Levitsky was from Sioux City, Iowa and I think graduated from the University
                    of Iowa and was interested in the Soviet Union. He later was ambassador to
                    Bulgaria as well as Brazil. I'd have to look at the list. The only one I really
                    kept up with was Rich Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know even the people you've mentionehere makes a point
                        that is often overlooked certainly by the public which operates on the
                        stereotype that the Foreign Service is the place of employment for the sons
                        and daughters of the rich East Coast elite who go to Ivy League colleges.
                        You don't exactly qualify, neither do your friends.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right and nor probably did most of my A-100 classmates. We had
                    a few people who fit into that mold, but I would say the majority of us were
                    ordinary folks like myself, although the middle of the country might have been a
                    little under-represented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like yourself, were most of them coming right from
                        academics or did they have other experience?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had a number of people who had a little bit of experience doing
                    something elsthe military, teaching or getting a Ph.D., or practicing law. We
                    had several lawyers in our group. I was one of the youngest in the class. I
                    think there was one younger, Tom Wajda, who was 21 to my 22. The average age
                    must have been in the high twenties, so many of them had been doing something
                    between college and entry into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting because I would have, I came in almost
                        six or seven years later, the group was younger and half of them were
                        actually just arriving from their Peace Corps tours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We were too early to have gotten any Peace Corps veterans because
                    they would have still been in their first tour in February of 1963. So, we were
                    kind of pre-Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the training at the A-100 strike you at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It struck me as quite interesting and struck a lot of my colleagues,
                    I think, as boring and not very good. I think just about everybody in the group
                    was in most ways more sophisticated than I about stuff like that. I thought
                    A-100 was kind of fun and for the most part interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything that particularly stands out that seemed like a
                        real introduction to diplomacy or international affairs or was it all how to
                        do your name cards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, as I recall we had some good, substantive lectures. One that I
                    remember was from somebody on the language side of FSI touting the importance of
                    learning to speak the language. An example they had was...you probably saw it
                    too...it was a CBS television film of an interview in Vietnam. You saw it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The American interviewer asks the Vietnamese peasant through an
                    interpreter, what do you think of the communists and the interpreter turns to
                    the peasant and says, count to ten and shake your fist. Mot, hai, ba... Then the
                    interpreter turns to the interviewer and says the farmer hates the
                    communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's striking in its simplicity...the importance of
                        language that unless you look your interlocutor in the eye and listen to
                        what he says, you're not getting the feedback, the data stream, that you
                        really need.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think that's very true. There have been times in my career when I
                    have missed something because I wasn't good enough in the language or able to
                    speak the language at all. It's a tremendous handicap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, well at the time you were in the A-100 was that
                        the time of the Cuban missile crisis or was that earlier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Cuban missile crisis was when I was at Occidental actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. As A-100 winds down, there's the assignment
                        process. They have their list and you have your wishes. How did that
                        unfold?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I believe I indicated on some sort of form my areas of preference.
                    I'm quite sure I put Southeast Asia at the top and Latin America probably was
                    number two. I think Latin America was number two because it was very much in the
                    news still in the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis and I think because in
                    the Kennedy administration there was a lot of emphasis on Latin America in
                    general. It had raised itself in my consciousness, so I put down Latin America.
                    I don't know what my third choice might have been, Europe maybe. In any event,
                    when the assignments were announced I was told I would be joining an information
                    retrieval project in the Administration Bureau of the State Department, just a
                    terrible thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you earlier said you put Southeast Asia on your list.
                        Were you responding to a personal interest in Southeast Asia or the daily
                        news as the Kennedy administration dealt with Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I am sure the media focus on Southeast Asia attracted my attention,
                    but my interest went back before that. Southeast Asia had always been an
                    interesting place to me. I remember the battle of Dien Bien Phu and the end of
                    the French experience in Vietnam. It was a very dramatic thing, something that
                    made headlines in the United States in 1954, when I was in the eighth grade. I
                    think ever since then I considered Vietnam in particular as an interesting and
                    kind of mysterious and romantic place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time that you were at Occidental, Ed Mill taught IR
                        classes, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Edward Mill, descendant of John Stuart Mill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background? I've forgotten. As a Foreign
                        Service Officer wasn't he a Europeanist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, he had some Southeast Asia experience. He had been a consul in
                    Surabaya at some point and I don't know quite what his status was, whether it
                    was Agency-connected or something else. He was not an FSO, but he had been
                    consul in Surabaya and he had also been in the Philippines, where he did some
                    outstanding work in training the nascent Philippine diplomatic corps. So, he had
                    a lot of interest in Southeast Asia and knew a lot of people there. That was his
                    regional passion. In fact, he was a winner of the Magsaysay Award for his work
                    in the Philippines. We became rather close. He visited Saigon while I was there,
                    at least once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excellent. Well, this pilot information retrieval project
                        sounds really exciting. You checked Southeast Asia and Latin American and
                        your reward was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: My reward was being assigned to a windowless office on the fifth
                    floor of the main State Department building along with about a half a dozen
                    other junior Foreign Service Officers including Rich Brown from my A-100 class
                    and a number of other victims from earlier classes. The reason junior officers
                    were found there, I believe, was that the project had a very limited budget. It
                    was being run by, and was the brainchild of a retired Navy captain who believed
                    in information retrieval possibilities. But because he had no money to hire
                    anyone he had to find free labor. So he went to the Junior Officer Division,
                    which was looking for places to shunt people and at least a half a dozen of us
                    ended up there. It was an outrageous thing for the JO Division to have done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What information were they retrieving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We would read CIA reports about Cuba that were generated during and
                    just after the Cuban missile crisis, all ex-post facto stuff, rarely anything of
                    continuing relevance as I recall. We would read those reports and then extract
                    the key information and record it on some kind of a form that could later be
                    transferred to some sort of machine readable card. It was just terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now stored somewhere in some government warehouse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, our work is still stored I imagine. We really, as a group, were
                    very depressed with it all. Our productivity was extremely low. Our morale was
                    very low, cynicism very high and I think if it had gone on much longer a few of
                    us might have resigned and tried something else with our lives. But fortunately
                    in the spring of '64 the project was ended. I guess what little money there was
                    ran out, so we were freed at last.</p>
                <p>I might add that somewhere during that period, possibly when the info retrieval
                    project ended, or maybe at the tail end of the A-100 class, I spent a month or
                    so as an intern in the office of one of the Kansas senators, Frank Carlson. I
                    enjoyed being on the Hill. I remember sitting in the House gallery while Sam
                    Rayburn presided. And I recall attending a hearing of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee, held in its small committee room in the Capital building.
                    The committee members sat at a large oval table, and chairs around the perimeter
                    of the room were available to anyone who wanted to watch. William Fulbright was
                    presiding. The first witness was Bill Bundy, and he was followed by Dean Rusk.
                    The subject was the situation in Southeast Asia. It was very intimate. Nobody
                    passed through a metal detector, or past any kind of guard that I remember.
                    Times were different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were telling me that that was the period when you
                        heard about the Kennedy assassination?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, when I was doing “information retrieval”, on what had been a
                    typical morning. We were sitting around drinking coffee - extracting very little
                    information - and the wife of Pat Flood who was one of our colleagues called him
                    and told him that Kennedy had been assassinated. So, we either got a radio or
                    went someplace where there was one, or a television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have had a strong emotional impact on the
                        group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it certainly did, as it did on everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying to improve your mind during that time you
                        were taking some early morning French at FSI (Foreign Service
                        Institute)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I did take early morning French, out of a desire to at least
                    feel that I was doing something positive with my life rather than simply whiling
                    it away in that windowless room. Then when the project collapsed I got into a
                    full time French course for a certain number of weeks, I can't remember how
                    many, and ended up with a pretty good French score.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That opportunity appeared because they didn't have
                        anything to do with you basically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, as I recall when the project ended there was nothing particular
                    on tap, and we all sort of went out there and scanned the horizon and tried to
                    figure out what might come next, and the next thing that appeared for me was a
                    new Vietnam program. AID was hiring young officers to be provincial
                    representatives in South Vietnam. That seemed right down my alley and so I
                    volunteered for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a secondment to AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was a secondment to AID. By that time the person in the Junior
                    Officer Division running that program was Allan Wendt. Allan later joined us in
                    Saigon and was the lucky guy who was in the embassy the night of the Tet
                    offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain how they described this job to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We would be working in provincial capitals in South Vietnam
                    administering aid programs - assistance to farmers, development of co-ops, some
                    public works projectand we would have a fair amount of authority in our
                    particular provinces, working directly with the province chiefs and with the
                    senior U.S. military advisor if there was one. It seemed to be a job that would
                    offer a good deal of responsibility and certain opportunities for adventure. It
                    sounded very good to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you arrive in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, I was diverted from that program during the course of language
                    training. After about one month of Vietnamese language training, which started
                    in August of 1964, I was doing quite well in Vietnamese. We were in a six month
                    course, newly designed specifically for this program. There were two other
                    people in a ten month program who were going into the political section of the
                    embassy. Dick Teare was one of them and Dick Burnham was the other. Dick Burnham
                    was not having a great time in Vietnamese and I don't think he was particularly
                    interested in it. So, Dick Burnham and I were switched, and to this day I don't
                    know exactly how that was done. I don't know if the language people initiated it
                    and it was then administratively affected somehow, but it was done without much
                    reference to any grand personnel plan certainly. It just happened. I was
                    consulted and decided to go with the flow. I was switched into the longer-term
                    program with Dick Teare, and I stayed at FSI for ten months instead of leaving
                    after six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got into the Vietnamese language program as
                        seconded to AID and then you got switched to regular Foreign Service embassy
                        assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: And Dick Burnham went into the AID program. Dick was an outstanding
                    officer, but left the Foreign Service after maybe ten years or so and had a very
                    good career with the World Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you were telling me earlier that that group that was
                        to be seconded to AID included Frank Wisner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Frank Wisner, Desaix Anderson, Steve Ledogar, Rich Brown, Clay
                    Nettles. I don't know if you've ever run across Clay Nettles, he's a wonderful
                    fellow. Paul London who was a very good officer; he left the Service early and
                    made an interesting career on the Hill and other places. I've got that whole
                    list downstairs along with a picture of the group as it appeared in the State
                    Department newsletter. Would you like to have it? We were the first group of
                    draftees for Vietnam and we were about half FSO and half AID direct-hires. The
                    direct-hires included older guys who came from the LAPD and places like that and
                    were in the Public Safety division of AID, as well as younger guys right off the
                    street. We didn't know it, but we were the first cadre in what later became
                    CORDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that would be very interesting and we can add
                        things like that to this record, but you're not going into CORDS, you're
                        going into the embassy after more Vietnamese language. So, when did you
                        actually arrive in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I arrived in Saigon in July of 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the political section. How was the political section
                        organized at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think it was organized as any political section was, with the
                    unusual exception of the so-called provincial reporting unit. The embassy had
                    its traditional economic section, political section, consular section, AID and a
                    huge CIA station, and then was of course operating side by side with and always
                    in danger of being overwhelmed by MACV, the military headquarters. The
                    provincial reporting unit was generally about a half dozen junior Foreign
                    Service Officers who were assigned to the provinces, but traveled to those areas
                    from Saigon. My territory in the beginning was the lower part of the Mekong
                    Delta. We would stay on the road two, three or four days, come back, write a
                    report about what we had seen and do the same thing the next week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would touch bases with both Vietnamese officials and
                        Americans that were out in these provinces. So, you'd speak to the governor
                        and the district chief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. I'd always see the governor, the members of the provincial
                    council - provincial councils were more honorary than substantive, but they were
                    reflective of what politics there were in the provinces. Prominent people.
                    People who had something to say about the situation in Chuong Thien or Bac Lieu.
                    Then always I would be in contact with the AID provincial representative, often
                    one of my former colleagues from FSI, and with the U.S. military people who were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now describe the area that you were originally assigned
                        to, what provinces or districts were those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was the lower, the southern part of Four Corps. Vietnam was
                    militarily divided into four corps areas. I Corps being in the North, II Corps
                    being the Central Highlands and central coast, III Corps the area right around
                    Saigon extending over to the Cambodian border, and IV Corps being the Mekong
                    Delta. IV Corps was in turn divided into what I believe was the ninth infantry's
                    area of responsibility and the 21st infantry's. These were Vietnamese military
                    unit designationno U.S. troop units were in the Delta at that time. The lower
                    part of the Mekong Delta was about as far off the map as you could get, the kind
                    of place that the brand new guy in the provincial reporting unit would be
                    assigned to. It included the southern tip of the Camau peninsula, mostly
                    mangrove swamps and heavily infested with Viet Cong—Bac Lieu, Ba Xuyen, Chuong
                    Thien right in the middle, Kien Giang on the Gulf of Siam side and An Giang,
                    which was the stronghold of the Hoa Haa fundamentalist Buddhist religious sect
                    and a fairly safe place because it was an unusually cohesive population. Can Tho
                    was the biggest city in “my” region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would meet with the Hoa Hao leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. In the manner of traditional Foreign Service work, in all of
                    these places I tried to get to know people who knew something or were in some
                    way influential.The Hoa Hao were quite effective in knitting the community
                    together and keeping out alien influences such as the Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you describe your duties primarily as observing and
                        reporting on what was going on and what resources were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's precisely what it was. It was nothing more. It was a very good
                    job in terms of the opportunity it provided to travel rather widely in a
                    particular area of Vietnam and be able to compare the way things were done in
                    one province with the way they were done in another. It gave you therefore a
                    slightly broader perspective than my AID colleagues would have had. But it
                    wasn't as meaty as being a provincial representative in other ways. I wasn't
                    handing out money. I wasn't a decision maker in a particular province. I was
                    simply a guy passing through and reporting back to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was traveling like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, it was by air almost exclusively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An Otter or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Usually by Air America transport, and Air America flew twin engine
                    Beechcraft, tail draggers, not the more modern turbo props or King Air type
                    Beechcraft although a few of those were coming into the inventory by the time I
                    left Saigon. That was probably the most common type of airplane that I flew in,
                    but I also flew in the latest Pilatus Porters, a wonderful turbo prop,
                    high-wing, single engine thing that could take off in about a hundred yards,
                    literally. There were Dorniers, a funny French twin engine high-winged airplane,
                    with the engines down on the wing struts. Yes, Otters as well. The Otters,
                    however, were always U.S. army aircraft, but we used them. Then very often
                    helicopters. Also C-46s and C-47s. Caribous, C-123s. I could go on</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Air was chosen over land?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Air was chosen over land because land travel would have required a
                    heavily armed military convoy to get from Saigon to virtually anywhere I was
                    going. You could drive from Saigon to My Tho, where Frank Wisner worked. I think
                    in good periods you could perhaps drive all the way to Vinh Long, one of “my”
                    provinces which was the next one down, but you were risking things to try to go
                    much beyond that. The roads very often were out. They had been sabotaged and/or
                    fallen into total disrepair because of nonuse. So, to get to a provincial
                    capital from Saigon, you almost always had to go by air. I went back to Vietnam
                    as a tourist in 1995 and we drove all the way from Hue to Saigon and My Tho. It
                    was quite wonderful because I saw country that I'd only seen from the air in the
                    sixties, including much of that beautiful central coastline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The requirement to use air all the time must have
                        underscored the idea that it wasn't secure and there were things that needed
                        to be done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: There was no doubt about that. I think the war in the Delta was
                    always pretty low intensity. There were rarely major battles that resulted in
                    huge numbers of casualties. There were often large sweeps by Vietnamese military
                    units and later by the U.S. 25th infantry division, but they rarely resulted in
                    major contacts with hundreds of people killed. Most of the war in the Delta,
                    right up to the end of the Vietnam War, was ambushes and attacks on isolated
                    outposts by roving bands of guerrillas or increasingly well armed units of one
                    kind or another. It made the whole area insecure in the sense that it was
                    certainly unsafe to be out on the road and a long way from home. As I say,
                    within the various provinces there were safe areas. I think for example in Vinh
                    Long province you could easily drive from Vinh Long to Sa Dec which was a major
                    district capital 30 or 40 miles away. In An Giang province, the Hoa Hao area,
                    there were broad areas in which you could travel safely. But in most of the
                    Delta it was quite risky. You couldn't really safely plan a Sunday afternoon
                    drive through the countryside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what then was the theme that you'd say would come out
                        of your reporting for this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I'd be interested and probably embarrassed to read some of my
                    provincial reports from that first six or eight months on the job. I imagine I
                    was far less critical than I should have been and far less discerning - probably
                    just generally naive. But there was a lot of variation. I think probably after
                    I'd been to An Giang or Kien Giang I would write a pretty doggone upbeat report
                    about prospects for security and stability in that province and the way the war
                    was going there. But after visiting Vi Thanh, the capital of Chuong Tien
                    province, there was very little positive one could have possibly said, because
                    Vi Thanh was an island in a sort of rice paddy sea of hostility as I remember
                    it. You really couldn't go anywhere outside that little town unless you were
                    armed and accompanied by lots of guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in the provincial reporting unit of the
                        political section. Who are some of the other PRU people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: When I arrived there Bill Marsh was the head of the provincial
                    reporting unit. Bill had been there at least a couple of years by then, a very
                    good officer. He was a strong intellect. He wrote well, he spoke well. He had an
                    ebullient, expansive personality. Still does. After a year or so, Dick Teare
                    replaced Bill as head of the unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here we go. Vlad Lehovich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Vlad had arrived a year or two before me. I think he and Dick
                    Holbrooke took language training together. I'm not sure if they had a full ten
                    months of it, but they had some Vietnamese language training together and I
                    think arrived in '62 or early '63. Steve Lyne, later an ambassador in Africa,
                    was provincial reporter for the mountainous regions and our man among the
                    Montagnards. He was not a Vietnamese language speaker, but he didn't really have
                    to be for that particular portfolio because he was dealing with tribesmen who
                    were a non-Vietnamese people.</p>
                <p>David Engel was in the section when I arrived. David Engel was a wonderful
                    Vietnamese speaker, the best I think the Foreign Service ever had. He was later
                    Henry Kissinger's interpreter in private meetings with Le Duc Tho in Paris. He
                    was assigned to the upper part of the Delta.</p>
                <p>Later on we had two David Browns. David E. Brown and David G. Brown who shared an
                    office in the new embassy when we moved therdesks back to back. Both of them
                    were very good writers and very good reporters I thought.</p>
                <p>Jim Bullington arrived in Vietnam when I did or shortly thereafter. I'm not sure
                    what his language training route had been because he wasn't in my class and he
                    was not in the AID class, but I think he'd had some training. He spent a little
                    bit of time in Saigon and then was almost immediately assigned to Hue or Da
                    Nang. He was in both Da Nang and Hue.</p>
                <p>Tim Carney was a provincial reporter at one point. Spence Richardson arrived a
                    year after me and we were housemates after Dick Teare left. Harry Dunlop
                    replaced Dick as chief of the unit. By and large I thought it was a very good
                    group of people, some talented FSOs who had good careers later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in terms of covering and reporting on Vietnam, the PRU
                        is in the embassy; are Da Nang and Hue going to have PRU reporting for their
                        areas, because Saigon is not all of Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I Corps was basically not covered from Saigon. It was covered from Da
                    Nang/Hue, and this varied. We had a consulate in Hue and we at one point moved
                    it to Da Nang, but we had had a consulate in Hue for a good long time. John
                    Helble was consul there years ago. As I recall, I Corps provincial reporting was
                    done by the people in Hue and/or Da Nang. We didn't have anybody who was in
                    Saigon and traveled regularly to I Corps.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, he was in the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. He spent at least six months in, I believe, Ba Xuyen province.
                    In fact the first time I met Dick was when we were going through language
                    training in the fall of '64 and he came back as a grizzled veteran and spoke to
                    our group about what it was really like. By the time I got to Saigon, Dick was
                    in the embassy. He had somehow moved from being a provincial representative in a
                    very obscure part of the Delta to being the ambassador's special assistant or
                    staff aid, to Maxwell Taylor. I'm not sure what Dick was doing when I got there.
                    He was between opportunities perhaps. Henry Cabot Lodge had just returned. Dick
                    didn't stay too long after I got there, but he was, I think, attached to the
                    political section. He had long since stopped being a provincial representative.
                    He had spent time in the front office. He was on his way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The PRU central reporting unit was part of the political
                        section, but there was a political section doing sort of standard political
                        reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The political section, the internal unit, was run by John Burke when
                    I arrived. Burke was replaced by Ted Heavner, a very good officer. And there was
                    an external unit, which had Dick Smyser, at one point Roger Kirk, and working in
                    it for a time was Frederick Flott.</p>
                <p>Did you ever hear of Fred Flott? Frederick W. Flott, whose job was to keep in
                    touch with officials of allied embassies - at that time we were desperately
                    trying to increase the numbers of “flags” that were flying in South Vietnam. So
                    we made major efforts internationally to get other governments to send troops,
                    even if we paid the freight. Today we would call it a “coalition of the
                    willing.” Fred Flott spent a lot of time liaising with the embassies of
                    troop-contributing countries, and so inevitably Frederick W. Flott was known as
                    “Free World Freddy.” That might have been Phil Habib's doing.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, they all arrived in the spring of 1965 and I didn't get out

                    Saigon domestic politics. Then I eventually moved in that direction myself and

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, definitely. He came in probably six or eight months after I got
                    there and he was assigned to I Corps. He was a great linguist. I believe he was
                    based in Da Nang as a provincial reporting officer assigned to that office. I
                    believe we still had the consulate in Hue. Da Nang was not a consulate, but it
                    operated like one, to a greater extent than the other corps headquarters did. II
                    Corps was headquartered in Nha Trang, III Corps was in Bien Hoa, and IV Corps
                    was in Can Tho. But only Da Nang had an office that operated like a
                    consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Standing back for a moment, Vietnam is becoming a major
                        issue. Administratively State has an embassy, it has a consulate there and
                        now they're adding these other reporting tools so it can report what's going
                        on in Vietnam. So did State have a separate stream of information from MACV?
                        I mean that's what the provincial reporters do. That's what the people who
                        are now in place are doing. So, State has actually made a major commitment
                        of manpower and resources to the whole Vietnam circumstances and you're
                        listing names of people who have become quite noted years later from that
                        experience who like yourself would become ambassadors and what not. It must
                        have been a very...I don't want to say driving experience, but a very
                        fulsome experience. It was an incredible introduction to the Foreign Service
                        world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was very intense. It was very absorbing. It was something you
                    lived 24 hours. For a young guy it was exciting, extremely interesting. I felt
                    like I was exactly where I wanted to be. Not everybody shared those feelings. A
                    lot of people were sent there against their wishes, but for me it was something
                    I really wanted to do. I've always felt that when something important is going
                    on, it's better to be close to the action rather than to be out on the
                    periphery. It's the same principle that would hold, for example, when there's a
                    presidential visit coming to your country and you have a chance to work on the
                    trip or to try to insulate yourself from it to the extent possible. The best
                    thing to do is to plunge in and be part of it and be close to the action. In
                    Saigon I felt very close to the action. I liked that. It was exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your entire tour spent in the provincial reporting
                        unit or you were saying that you were moving onto other duties in time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: My provincial reporting experience actually was in two parts. Most of
                    it was in the Lower Mekong Delta, but I also did a few months as a provincial
                    reporter in the central coastal provinces, replacing Vlad Lehovich who by then
                    had finished at least three years. That was a good change of scene for me and it
                    broadened my perspective a bit. A different kind of war in the central
                    provinces, much more main force action - and more intense politics
                    traditionally, because that had always been a more highly developed part of the
                    country. Then in the...I would say...the spring of 1966, we - the United States
                    government - came to the conclusion that something better had to be done in
                    terms of developing a viable South Vietnamese government that might command the
                    respect of its people.</p>
                <p>There had been a series of coups and revolving-door military governments in
                    Saigon ever since the November 1963 assassination of Diem. There were Nguyen
                    Khanh, “Big” Minh, Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu, jousting with each other.
                    It was a mess, and a situation that was causing a rapid diminution of confidence
                    in the United States in addition to the effect that it was having within South
                    Vietnam. There was no real effective government in Saigon; therefore, the war
                    effort in the provinces was hampered and diluted and made ineffective. In the
                    United States people were beginning to wonder what this was all about. So, in
                    the spring of '66, we began a process of constitutional government building. It
                    was, I'm sure, more our initiative than the initiative of the South Vietnamese,
                    but we guided them through a process - electing a constituent assembly, i.e., a
                    constitutional assembly, drafting a constitution and then on the basis of that
                    constitution, electing a president - between 1966 and the end of 1967. When that
                    happened I moved to the internal unit of the political section and this
                    constitution building effort became my full-time job, mine and John
                    Negroponte's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does that express itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, first, we were involved in organizing and developing the rules
                    for the constituent assembly election as I remember. I don't recall exactly what
                    entities we were working with or through. The ambassador and the big guns in the
                    embassy worked with the South Vietnamese leadership establishing the ground
                    rules and timing for the constituent assembly election. For me it meant a lot of
                    traveling prior to the constituent assembly election to the provinces, including
                    places I'd never been to before, to talk with local officials and encourage
                    people to run for office, and to talk with American officials and explain to
                    them what this was going to be all about and encourage them to watch the process
                    closely and let us know what was happening. In that brief period I traveled to
                    darn near every province in the country. I recall returning to the embassy at
                    midnight from one such trip and writing up a long report on a yellow legal pad
                    and taking it directly to the code room. There was a response to it the next
                    day, commenting on some issues I had raised. I later learned it had been written
                    personally by Dean Rusk. That seemed perfectly natural somehow. The election was
                    held in, you probably know this from your chronology, the summer of '66 and a
                    constituent assembly was convened in Saigon and began the process of drafting a
                    constitution. Negroponte and I were basically the embassy's lobbyists. We spent
                    all day in the old opera house advising these Vietnamese politicians on how to
                    draft a really good constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not exactly a reprise of what MacArthur did in Tokyo;
                        there were other things quite distracting at the time going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and MacArthur had full authority, we didn't, notwithstanding
                    what some people thought. We learned our limitations as this process went
                    forward. We did have some influence, undoubtedly, on the shape of the
                    constitution. We had a guy attached at that time to the political section - Phil
                    Habib was political counselor - a fellow by the name of Bert Flanz, who was an
                    academic and whose specialty was constitutions. He had been sent out to Seoul in
                    the early sixties when Phil was the political counselor there to help us help
                    the Koreans write a constitution. In any event, he was there and we had lots of
                    people with lots of fixed ideas about what ought to be in that constitution and
                    what ought not be in it. One of the points that we worked hardest on was Article
                    IV, which as written would have prohibited anyone who was ever a member of the
                    Viet Cong from ever having any role in the political life of South Vietnam. We
                    wanted to eliminate that or change it so that in the future in South Vietnam
                    there could be some degree of political reconciliation in which former Viet Cong
                    could be members of the national assembly or otherwise participate in politics.
                    The constituent assembly members were very strongly set against that and it was
                    not changed. I think the constituent assembly was a group of authentic
                    representatives of their communities. Article IV was something that they felt
                    strongly about and that probably a great many of their constituents also felt
                    strongly about. A spirit of reconciliation was not abroad in the land. In any
                    event we certainly lost on that provision, and on others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning a moment ago that Phil Habib comes in
                        as a political counselor. What's it like to work for Phil Habib?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I always thought it was great working for Phil Habib. He arrived in
                    the political section shortly after I did. When I got there the previous
                    Counselor, Mel Manfull, was just leaving. I was kind of inhibited by Phil when I
                    first saw him and I thought, man, he comes on awfully strong. You know, brusque,
                    a lot of humor there, but you don't necessarily recognize it right at first.
                    Very smart. He soon became very popular with everybody who worked for him. He
                    was a much-loved guy. I felt that way about him in Saigon and I was lucky to
                    work for him, there and in a couple of other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, that admiration was professional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Professional and personal. Personally he was always entertaining to
                    be around. He had boundless energy. He and Barry Zorthian, the public affairs
                    counselor, and John Negroponte, the most sophisticated junior officer I ever
                    came across, and one other guy would have an all night poker game once a week. I
                    don't know how they did it, but Phil was able to burn the candle at both ends in
                    those days and he kept doing it until he had the first of his heart attacks. I
                    was still in Saigon, and Phil was by then back in Washington when he came out to
                    Saigon for a visit shortly after the Tet Offensive. Phil came out to assess the
                    situation and to go back with his own views as to what we ought to be doing.
                    More troops, fewer troops, etc. During his visit he had what I'll bet was a mild
                    heart attack. He sort of collapsed at Arch Calhoun's house on a Sunday
                    afternoon. He didn't have a full-scale heart attack as far as I know until he
                    was ambassador to Seoul, but he was clearly on the way. Anyway, he was extremely
                    energetic, very bright, a man with a complete common touch, no pretensions about
                    him at all. You couldn't help but like him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, yes, Phil would never have suggested that anybody shade the truth
                    as they saw it for the sake of some sort of harmonious product. He wasn't like
                    that. You always felt that you had his backing and that he intended for people
                    to call the shots as they saw them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were suggesting a little mentoring perhaps on his

                        after this. By then he had seen quite a bit of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I think he was good at giving career advice. I probably had
                    better conversations with him later on in Paris and in Washington than I did in
                    Saigon where he was busier and I was one of a great many chicks in his flock. I
                    remember in Paris once talking with Phil about his work as a deputy assistant
                    secretary just after he'd gotten back from being political counselor in Saigon,
                    and in that capacity he was probably the Department's senior guy who did nothing
                    but Vietnam. He had a lot of contact as a result with all the big players in the
                    administration right up to and including Lyndon Johnson. He sort of marveled at
                    the idea that he, Phil Habib, a kid from Brooklyn, was moving in those circles
                    and he appreciated it. It was touching.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Kissinger back in the mid '60s was a consultant to the Johnson
                    administration on Vietnam, a country about which he knew very little. But
                    nevertheless, he had his views and he paid periodic visits in his consultancy
                    capacity. Sam Huntington also came out once or twice, along with Allan Goodman
                    who was a graduate student then and is now dean at Georgetown. In any event, one
                    time when Kissinger came, Harry Dunlop and I accompanied him to Qui Nhon,
                    capital of Binh Dinh province, where he was to get briefings on the pacification
                    program and how things were going in the war in Binh Dinh province. We flew up
                    in a twin engine Cessna. I think the army night have called it a U-21. Anyway it
                    was a small aircraft, but adequate to the task. We got to Qui Nhon and went
                    through briefings, carefully prepared briefings, by Vietnamese and U.S. army
                    officers. Kissinger was bored by it all and I think got very little out of it,
                    and his boredom was evident to everyone. As I recall it was a little bit
                    embarrassing. When it came time to return to Saigon, we went out to the airport
                    at Qui Nhon, which was U.S. army-controlled, run by a U.S. army colonel. Gale
                    force winds had come up during the course of the day and the airport was closed.
                    Sandbags were being placed on top of the wings of the airplanes lined up along
                    the tarmac. Kissinger was dismayed because he had a dinner appointment that
                    night with Henry Cabot Lodge; this was a big deal and he wanted to keep that
                    appointment. Our pilot was a very senior colonel and held a rating of master
                    pilot, which he contended allowed him to override the wishes of base commanders.
                    So he and the base commander had a nasty argument after which we took off. There
                    was a small mountain at the end of that runway and I remember when he pulled the
                    nose up we seemed to almost bounce off the ground. It was one of the scariest
                    flights I ever made, and I made a lot of questionable flights in small aircraft
                    while I was in Vietnam. Kissinger was in a white knuckle condition the entire
                    way back to Saigon as Harry and I were too, I imagine. But he got to his dinner
                    appointment with Henry Cabot Lodge on time and so he was presumably happy at the
                    end of the day. Kissinger, we knew, was a guy who didn't like flying much except
                    in very large aircraft. Thus, he was really making a risky move by his lights to
                    get in this little airplane under those conditions. That's how important that
                    dinner with Henry Cabot Lodge was for him.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: You bet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vietnam is a major issue and is going to attract a lot of
                        visitors. Were there any others that you recall? My notes say that McNamara
                        came out in August of '65. There must have been others that you were
                        involved with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: When is your McNamara trip?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's August of '65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Actually I am thinking of Thanksgiving of '65. I was with Bill Marsh.
                    We were having our Thanksgiving with the Special Forces “A” team on Phu Quoc
                    Island and we got word while we were there that SECDEF was on his way and we
                    were needed back in Saigon, so they sent an airplane for us. I don't remember
                    the first McNamara visit and I don't remember a whole lot about the visit that
                    we returned for in November of '65. We had a whole host of prominent
                    congressional people coming through, including a Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee delegation led by Mike Mansfield. Mansfield was of course a strong
                    skeptic of our Vietnam effort. I remember sitting in on a briefing for him in
                    the political counselor's living room. Presidential hopefuls visited, and other
                    prominent people. I met Richard Nixon in Phil Habib's upstairs lounghe was
                    traveling under Pepsi Cola auspices. Ed Muskie visited around the time of the
                    constituent assembly election I believe, and I accompanied him around town and
                    interpreted for him. George Romney of Michigan, of course, famously visited
                    Vietnam and my housemate Dick Teare was in charge of his visit and therefore
                    presumably was at least partially responsible for “brainwashing” him. I had
                    lunch one time at Ambassador Lodge's table on his patio, where he always had
                    lunch in good weather, with Walter Mondale, who at that time was the up and
                    coming young Attorney General of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>There were other prominent people from other walks of life who would breeze
                    through Saigon to see the place, to boost the morale of the troops in one way or
                    another, or for other reasons of their own. Many of them would somehow end up
                    being in our care for a few hours or a few days. I took Mary McCarthy around
                    Saigon one time. Mary was acerbic and didn't seem real interested in what we
                    were doing, but I tried to put Saigon's best face forward in our afternoon
                    together. We visited several of the local sights including the opera house where
                    the constituent assembly was in session and then we went across the street to
                    the veranda of the Continental Hotel - a very pleasant spot - where we had
                    coffee and I asked her what she thought of Saigon. She said, “It's a dreadful
                    place.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you stopped going into the tour business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. It was as Baghdad would be today, where for one reason or
                    another, politicians felt compelled to go, and when they went they required
                    escorts, and very often that duty fell to the political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, where are we? Why don't we take a break for a
                        second? We were talking about the other experiences you were having out of
                        the political section. You have a note here that in the spring of '66 you
                        got involved in some interesting negotiations. You had spoken earlier about
                        helping the constituent assembly do the constitution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Now, you're speaking of?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a standoff in Hue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, yes. Hue in the spring of '66 as I recall. This is before the
                    constituent assembly process got started and it, in fact, was one of the events
                    that gave a little bit of impetus to that process because it once again seemed
                    to indicate that South Vietnam was coming apart at the seams. In the spring of
                    '66, Nguyen Chanh Thi, who was the commander of I Corps as I remember it, was
                    very much in opposition to the government in Saigon of Nguyen Cao Ky, a general
                    in the air force. I don't remember what his exact grievances were, but he
                    essentially was challenging the authority of Nguyen Cao Ky and in effect
                    threatening to go his own way. His stance was completely unacceptable in Saigon,
                    and it was troubling in the extreme to the United States as well, and we wanted
                    to put an end to this incipient rebellion. We brokered a meeting between Nguyen
                    Chanh Thi and Nguyen Cao Ky and the meeting was to take place at the villa on
                    the beach in Da Nang of General Lou Walt, commander of the Third Marine
                    Amphibious Force, the senior U.S. military officer in I Corps. Before the
                    meeting took place we sent someone up to Da Nang to “wire” the room so that we
                    would have our own independent record of what actually was said. The meeting
                    took place on schedule and the tape was urgently flown back to Saigon. An
                    interpreter/translator for another agency was going to attempt to transcribe the
                    tape. Phil Habib instructed me to help him. So I and the other fellow went into
                    a soundproof room somewhere in the bowels of that old embassy on Ham Nghi Street
                    in Saigon and turned on the tape recorder. We could hear snatches of
                    conversation, but primarily only the hum of a big floor fan as it rotated across
                    the room. We couldn't get anything useful out of that tape. I think the floor
                    fan was placed there because both Nguyen Chanh Thi and Nguyen Cao Ky suspected
                    what we were trying to do and they didn't want us to hear what they were saying.
                    I told Phil, “Sorry, there's nothing useful on this tape.” You can probably
                    imagine his reaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High standards indeed. Actually you were noted or it was
                        remarked by other people at the time that you were one of the best
                        Vietnamese linguists in the mission at that time. In fact you tell another
                        story here about translating between embassy and the South Vietnamese
                        cabinet from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That was not a translating or interpreting situation. That was a
                    note-taking situation. The American Embassy country team, which naturally in
                    Saigon had to be called something grander - it was the “mission council” met on
                    a regular basis with the cabinet of South Vietnam, as if these were two co-equal
                    bodies. In fact in many respects, we of course had the final say. In any event,
                    there would be regular meetings between the prime minister and the ambassador
                    and their respective staffs, i.e., the South Vietnamese cabinet and the American
                    Embassy Mission Council. It would actually alternate between the presidential
                    palace and the American Embassy. Even at the time it seemed to me that this was
                    a demeaning practice to put the South Vietnamese through. They were after all,
                    at least theoretically a sovereign government, and to have them troop over to
                    the American Embassy for a meeting was really quite astounding when you think
                    about it. I was the note taker for that meeting at least once, and had there
                    been any need for translation it would have been French to English, not
                    Vietnamese. All of the cabinet members spoke French fluently and fortunately
                    almost all of them spoke English quite adequately. So, as I recall the meeting
                    was almost entirely in English.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But isn't this an interesting issue as you were just
                        saying, the symbolic relationship between the embassy and the government of
                        South Vietnam, I mean how would their own press play such a meeting or did
                        they not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: They probably did not. Their own press counted for very little
                    really. This is an issue that we've faced in other places around the world and
                    that we're facing in spades - John Negroponte is facing - right now in Iraq. How
                    do you conduct yourselves when you have overweening power and authority and yet
                    you're trying to stress the independence and sovereignty of your host
                    government? You've got to really be careful about it, and we were not nearly as
                    careful as we should have been in Saigon, and to some extent that weakened the
                    South Vietnamese government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The host audience for that is the national citizens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: You bet. The people who see it happening. We needed more than
                    anything else in Vietnam a government that truly commanded the respect and
                    allegiance of the South Vietnamese people, and I doubt that the way we treated
                    the government necessarily contributed to that goal. It goes right to the point
                    of the nature of our role in Vietnam, as it was transformed by us from a
                    supportive one on the periphery of the conflict to being at the very center of
                    that conflict and in fact carrying the main load.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once you grabbed the metal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. So, this practice of frequent meetings between the cabinet of an
                    independent and sovereign government and the American Embassy was just a
                    reflection of the way the relationship actually had evolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did that set up start? Had that been going on
                        sometime by the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think it probably had, perhaps not for a long time, but it was
                    certainly not new when I was introduced to it. We'd had a central role in
                    Vietnamese politics since before the overthrow and assassination of Diem. We had
                    just become a little bit too obvious about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would proceed until when? These meetings, in this
                        manner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I suppose they continued. I don't know if they were still going on in
                    the latter years of our presence in Vietnam, but certainly in '65, '66, '67,
                    that was the routine practice. I'd like to think it stopped after the 1967
                    election, but I don't recall, or at least that we went to their offices rather
                    than they to ours.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, particularly after I left the provincial reporting business
                    which did let you sort of brush up against realities and the war in various
                    ways, working in Saigon was like working in a lot of other capitals I suppose.

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: In the spring of '65 after the embassy had been car-bombed, all the
                    dependents in Saigon were sent home so that by the time I got there in July it
                    was a bachelor post. I shared a house with Dick Teare, my language-training
                    partner and Dick was there for a two-year tour as Provincial Reporting Chief.
                    When he left, Spence Richardson became my housemate and we shared that house for
                    another year. I lived in a separate house within a five house compound that had
                    been owned by a French bank. The largest house on the compound was the residence
                    of the political counselor and the others were either political officers or the
                    number two guy in USIS. The political counselor's house had a small swimming
                    pool, which was the site of frequent Sunday afternoon water polo games. George
                    H. W. Bush participated in one of those water polo games once. He was visiting
                    as a newly elected congressman from Houston. He was about 40 years old and
                    looked like he was 25.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In addition to your duties, did you have any off duty
                        interests that you could or did pursue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, not really. There were plenty of places to eat and drink in
                    Saigon at night. Tu Do Street was extremely lively. There were quite a number of
                    good places to have a meal. There were always parties to attend, plenty to do
                    after hours, even though our hours tended to be very long. We worked until the
                    early evening routinely. We always worked at least Saturday mornings, often
                    Saturday afternoons, and sometimes Sundays as well. It seemed like the job was
                    kind of always with you, but at the same time you were surrounded by people in
                    the same boat and there was a lot of camaraderie and a lot of fun as I
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the ambassador most of that time was Bunker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall exactly when Henry Cabot Lodge left and Bunker
                    arrived, but, yes, by sometime in '66 probably, Ellsworth Bunker had arrived in
                    Saigon. A very fine gentleman. I liked him very much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did his arrival make any atmospheric difference for the
                        embassy and its work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall that it did for me, quite frankly. But I'm sure that
                    people closer to the top felt a difference. His personal style and Henry Cabot
                    Lodge's were quite different. Bunker must have been a much easier man to be
                    around than Henry Cabot Lodge. It seemed to me to be that way at least, and I
                    suspect that was in truth the nature of his personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the time that there were deputy ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the embassy organized now by '66 or '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, there was a deputy ambassador, Sam Berger, and then Bill Porter
                    or perhaps Bill Porter and then Sam Berger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, no. That's Sandy. This is Sam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He was a distinguished career Foreign Service Officer. There was
                    beneath the deputy ambassador in the hierarchy, a guy called the “Mission
                    Coordinator,” who at first was Phil Chadbourn, a French specialist who spent
                    years as consul general in Marseilles. I think his was kind of an administrative
                    role and not analogous to a DCM. He was more a very senior special assistant
                    perhaps, to the two ambassadors. There was nobody called DCM. The political
                    minister ran the political section. You had very senior talented people in the
                    economic section. Chuck Cooper was the Economic Minister most of the time I was
                    in Saigon; he was an AID star who later did other senior jobs within the
                    administration on the economic side. The station chief was Bill Colby. For a
                    time, Ed Lansdale had his own, sort of parallel political section. The embassy
                    must have had an interesting looking organization chart. There were two MACV
                    chiefs while I was there - MACV was part of the Mission Council even though it
                    was an 800-pound gorilla - William Westmoreland was followed by Creighton
                    Abrams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a POL/MIL counselor there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, there was a POL/MIL section in the embassy. That may have been
                    Roger Kirk's job in fact. I said earlier in our conversation that he had been on
                    the external side, but I think he was political-military when he was in Saigon.
                    There were several officers doing that sort of thing with MACV and you can
                    imagine the range of issues that they had to deal with in an operation like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these kinds of very interesting environments, all kinds
                        of sort of unusual circumstances come up. You were telling me about Dick
                        Teare's trip to Hong Kong where he had his own airplane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, the point I was making was that during the Vietnam War, and I'm
                    sure this is the case right now in Baghdad, resources were not an issue. If
                    something needed to be done and it required calling up a special flight for
                    somebody to do it, that was never a problem. In this particular case, just as an
                    example, a congressional delegation, I think perhaps the one that was led by
                    Mike Mansfield, had come through Saigon. Some record of their conversations was
                    being written up. Or possibly they had asked for an analytical paper of some
                    kind. They wanted to have that as soon as possible. They had moved on to Hong
                    Kong. Dick Teare took the paper in question to them in Hong Kong with his own
                    private jet. This was not particularly unusual. There was an embarrassment of
                    resources. What did the Vietnam War cost us? It's an astounding figure and some
                    small portion of it went for things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the other points you were making though is the
                        difference in technology that we might not understand now 40 years
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. The reason there had to be a paper delivered in Hong
                    Kong was because there was no way to transmit a lengthy document more quickly.
                    Obviously we did not have e-mail. That was 30 years in the future. We did a lot
                    of our provincial reporting by way of typed airgrams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was the green paper, type the report, put it in the
                        pouch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. I remember it as being yellow, but in any event, it was
                    on paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was yellow and cables were green.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Everything was cumbersome and quite slow. It was very difficult to
                    make a phone call to Washington. Or should I say it was certainly not routine to
                    make a phone call to Washington, although there was a lot of telephoning done
                    between the embassy and Washington because of the priority of the issue - but it
                    was expensive and not something undertaken lightly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about internal communication within the embassy? You
                        had a telephone at your house, did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, telephones as I recall worked pretty well and I don't remember
                    whether we were on the regular Saigon phone system or whether we were knit
                    together in some sort of special system that linked us to the embassy. I quite
                    frankly don't remember that. We may have had two phones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have individual radios?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No. I don't think I had a radio in my house. If I did I never used
                    it. There may have been one within the compound. The political counselor's house
                    may have had something like that. It was sort of the dark ages as far as modern
                    communication is concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Saigon for the Tet Offensive, which started
                        the evening of January 31, 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, I distinguished myself at the very beginning of the Tet
                    Offensive by sleeping through it. I'd been out late the night before with Hal
                    Colbaugh and if I heard anything during the night I probably assumed it was Tet
                    fireworks going off. I woke up at the usual time in the morning, turned on the
                    radio to the armed forces radio station, and the announcer was telling everyone
                    that this was not a normal day and that the embassy would not be opening on time
                    inasmuch as it was still occupied by a squad of Viet Cong. So, I got dressed and
                    went next door to the political counselor's house where he was on the phone with
                    Washington and with Allan Wendt, the duty officer who was inside the embassy.
                    There were other people there as well and I was more than a little put out that
                    nobody had seen fit to wake me up. By then Arch Calhoun was the political
                    counselor and he was dealing with the situation, I guess conveying information
                    from Allan Wendt back to the Department via the telephone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Allan's being in the embassy, the duty officer in the
                        embassy? If you're duty officer, do you go to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The duty officer slept in the embassy. There was a room with a bed in
                    it up near the code room and that's where he was when the attack happened. I got
                    to the embassy I think by around 9:00 am, just about the time that Bunker showed
                    up. On the front lawn of the embassy were a number of deceased Viet Cong. The
                    place was a mess, as you can imagine. There weren't shattered windows because
                    some kind of plexiglass window had been used in that building, someone having
                    had this sort of thing in mind. One of the things that quickly changed in the
                    architecture of the place was that the large decorative planters spotted around
                    the lawn of the embassy were removed - they had been very good firing positions
                    for the Viet Cong. They were sort of like concrete lily pads. It was a very
                    strange thing to see. The dead bodies on the lawn. The hole blasted in the
                    perimeter wall. The guard booth where the American GIs had been shot. The
                    mission counselor's house, by then occupied by George Jacobsen, was an old
                    French villa within the embassy compound and it had been the scene of some
                    dramatic action. A Viet Cong soldier, or one or more, was actually going up the
                    stairs ready to dispatch George Jacobsen when one of the marine security guards
                    threw a pistol up to his bedroom window and he caught it and shot the guy as he
                    came in his door. It was that close and there was a picture in Life Magazine of
                    the security officer - it wasn't a marine - it was a security officer, crawling
                    along outside this villa getting ready to throw the gun up to George. Do you
                    remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, as a matter of fact I do. So, people didn't have
                        personal weapons up to that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I would have thought Jacobsen would have had. I think he was a
                    retired military officer, but apparently he didn't have one where he needed it.
                    It might have been downstairs. After the Tet Offensive, fighting continued
                    around Saigon sporadically, quite a lot in the days immediately after the Tet
                    Offensive when there was also continued fighting in Nha Trang and of course in
                    Hue. Scattered around Saigon, particularly in Cholon, there were still communist
                    units present and causing havoc. It was easy to get a gun if you wanted one, so
                    I got one at that point, a .38. I kept it beside my bed at night. There were
                    several times in the ensuing weeks when at night it seemed like something was
                    happening right outside my house. At night gunfire can be misleading I think if
                    you're not experienced with it. There were certainly little skirmishes that took
                    place not very far from where I lived. There were also incoming rockets during
                    that period and one of them landed on one of the houses in our compound. Gil
                    Sheinbaum's house across the way. You know Gil?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why yes. We're currently serving together as Retiree
                        Representatives on the Board of the American Foreign Service Association
                        (AFSA).</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, well, ask him about that; although Gil might have left Vietnam
                    by then. So, it was a very strange period. We had seemed to be making a lot of
                    progress in Vietnam, particularly through this political process that we had
                    pushed. The constitution was drafted. It was ratified. A presidential election
                    was held. It was a pretty good electiofree if not entirely fair. Nguyen Van
                    Thieu had won with a plurality of the vote in a multi-candidate contest,
                    monitored by international observers. It was one of the first elections in which
                    that sort of thing was done. When Thieu was inaugurated (our new embassy was
                    dedicated at about the same time), Hubert Humphrey came out for the occasion.
                    That was in November of 1967 and we were beginning to be a little bit optimistic
                    about the prospects for a happy outcome to this whole thing. Then in January of
                    '68 the Tet Offensive took place - less than two months lateand it basically
                    rendered moot anything that had been going on politically in Vietnam and it
                    essentially wrote an end to any possibility of a successful military outcome as
                    well. I would not have imagined in the aftermath of Tet and the aftermath of
                    Lyndon Johnson's decision to not run again that there would have been four more
                    years of pretty intense warfare, as there were, before our withdrawal. Tet
                    fundamentally changed things. It changed the atmosphere in Saigon. I don't
                    recall exactly what I was doing in the political section the last six months
                    that I was there, but I think everybody believed we were just treading
                    water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us a better sense of what you mean by a
                        changed atmosphere in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Prior to Tet there was, as I said, a feeling that we were on the road
                    to something that could be called a success. The military campaign had been
                    going reasonably well and we were very much encouraged by the political
                    developments that had taken place. It seemed like we, or they, had at last
                    established a really legitimate government that no one could dispute. Maybe we
                    were going to come out all right. I think at the end of 1967 that was a pretty
                    widespread feeling, perhaps not in the country at large, but among those of us
                    in Saigon and probably in Washington. And then came the Tet Offensive - which
                    militarily was a net loss for the communist side. But it represented a huge
                    political victory for them and a tremendous political defeat for us. That was
                    obvious to everyone who was there and it sort of zapped morale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because by '68 we had so identified with a specific
                        outcome in Saigon. When you arrived in '64 could we say that we weren't as
                        tightly identified with what was going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Had I arrived in '64 we could have said that, but I arrived in
                    '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, '65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: By which time we already had 65,000 or 70,000 U.S. forces on the
                    ground in Vietnam, mostly up in I Corps, but we were there, we were engaged in
                    combat operations, not just in an advisory role. It probably was already a
                    little bit too late. But by the time Tet '68 rolled around we had well over
                    500,000 troops in-country.</p>

                        the Department and on that honor roll there are quite a number of people
                        from this period of Foreign Service Officers killed in Vietnam. Did you know
                        any of those people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think the only guy I knew and then only slightly was Dwight Owen,
                    who was a young summer intern in the political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had summer interns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had one. He's the only one I remember and I think he perhaps had
                    some connection that enabled him to do it. He was a very bright young man and he
                    was out in the countryside, I think in Binh Dinh province, and he was killed by
                    a mortar. I recall David Engel having a narrow escape from a land mine. He ended
                    up bloodied a bit, but not hurt seriously. Of course there were a number of
                    Foreign Service Officers who were injured in the bombing of the embassy in March
                    of '65 before I got there, including Jim Rosenthal who was badly cut up. Edie
                    Apple, who later became the wife of R.W. Apple of the New York Times, was in the
                    consular section. Eva Kim I think was hurt in that bombing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think there was an option for three years with perhaps a home leave
                    thrown in at the middle of the three years. At least I did have a home leave. I
                    was a bachelor and so I had no good reason to make it a two-year tour, which is
                    what it was for Dick Teare. I was there three years, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I thought my next assignment was going to be the Paris Peace Talks
                    which had begun in May of 1968. John Negroponte, who had left the embassy
                    sometime earlier was working in the Paris delegation and I was slated to replace
                    him. Then Cyrus Vance decided that John was too valuable to let go, and
                    therefore I was out of a job temporarily. I'm not sure how my assignment to
                    Indonesia came about, but in any event I went to Indonesia. I was interested in
                    doing that.</p>

                    began Indonesian language training. It ended around February or March, and in
                    late March or April, I was in Medan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you this, when you left for the Saigon tour and

                        out of the country now for four years during this very intense period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was 1968 - a bad year, let's face it. Bobby Kennedy was shot,
                    Martin Luther King was shot, the Democrats had their rollicking convention in
                    Chicago shortly after I got back. Vietnam was very much a part of the political
                    discourse, shall we say, and I had my own views on it and a perspective that I
                    recognized was very different from most people I talked to because I had been
                    there. I saw it from a different angle and I still feel that's true today to
                    some extent. I have yet to see “my” Vietnam movie or really read my Vietnam
                    book. I was staying in an apartment near the State Department and Arch Calhoun
                    came through. He had been sent back from Saigon to work within the
                    administration on a plan to arrange a bombing halt and a start to formal
                    negotiations in Paribefore the election. There had been the “shape of the table”
                    negotiations essentially up to that point and the Administration wanted to push
                    the peace talks onto a new level and do that through a bombing halt. In recent
                    years there have been reports, I believe based on declassified documents, that
                    the Nixon campaign was probably communicating with Nguyen Van Thieu to encourage
                    him to hold out for something better. I read about it all in the newspapers in
                    that summer and fall of '68 and felt very much on the sidelines, but I was
                    intensely interested in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Vietnam movie, what would that be about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: My Vietnam movie wouldn't be a very good one. But I developed a great
                    respect for a lot of the politicians that I got to know in South Vietnam. I
                    thought them to be genuine nationalists. They were in no sense puppets of the
                    United States. They had real standing in their local constituencies. Many of
                    them had a good deal of moral courage. They disliked the authoritarian
                    government structure that they were operating within. They wanted something
                    better and they were trying to work toward that. They were completely
                    independent of the communists and recognized that communism was even worse. Many
                    of them were from time to time in physical danger or had been in the past. Some
                    of the older ones had been jailed by the French, and then jailed by the
                    communists. They'd paid their dues in a very considerable way. They were going
                    about a serious business trying to save their country and give it a better
                    future, so I had a lot of respect for them as a group. I think what we were
                    trying to do with them was a worthwhile and honorable undertaking. That's what I
                    was doing the last couple of years of my tour and so that's the perspective I
                    took away when I left Vietnam. Wouldn't be a good movie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a political Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, there was one and it was a real country and had some real
                    strengths. Political constituencies corresponded generally with provincial
                    boundaries. I believe in both the constituent assembly and the follow-on
                    national assembly, each province had at least one representative and the larger
                    provinces had more. The Buddhists certainly were represented. By 1966, however,
                    the more activist Buddhist leaders had calmed down somewhathey had originally
                    risen up against Diem, of course. Thich Tri Quang was no longer a huge
                    influence, but his group, centered on the An Quang Pagoda, was still important.
                    There was a Catholic-Buddhist split politically in South Vietnam. The Catholics
                    were a minority, but enjoyed disproportionate power in government, the military,
                    etc. not unlike the Sunni minority in Iraq under Saddam. After Diem's overthrow,
                    however, that split became less important. The government was no longer
                    Catholiit was military, unfortunately; I don't even recall the religious
                    persuasion of some of those generals. But it was a fractious, and to some degree
                    fractured, societand it had to cope with a well organized, externally supported
                    insurgency.</p>
                <p>If South Vietnam had been given a chancthat is to say if the North Vietnamese had
                    not been fueling the insurgency, and then directly intervening with very large
                    numbers of well equipped troopI think democracy could have taken root. There was
                    a political culture, and there were some talented politicians, many of whom I
                    knew. It could have worked. But under those circumstances, there was no real
                    chance.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Possibly. Yes. I was particularly close to a couple of young
                    politicians who were the chief organizers of a small faction within the
                    Constituent Assembly called the National Renaissance Movement. I forget its
                    Vietnamese name, but that's what it meant. They were about my age and attractive
                    young guys with beautiful wives. Sort of courageous and brash and on the
                    dissident side you would say in terms of their political leanings. They were
                    very much against the military government. Their paths diverged completely, I
                    later learned. When I was named ambassador one of them must have seen a
                    reference to me in the newspapers and he wrote to me from Canada. He and I
                    corresponded a little bit. He left for Canada in 1975 and will never return to
                    Vietnam. He's a diehard opponent of the communists and could never imagine
                    accommodating to them in any way. His friend and political ally stayed in Saigon
                    and has made a life for himself. I had indirect contact with him in later years.
                    I never got to see him or talk to him directly, but I heard of him through a
                    third party. He has some sort of business now. His association with the South
                    Vietnamese governing structure landed him in trouble for a few years when the
                    communists took over, but he got through it and is doing okay. Both were, and
                    are, fine men. Another who I did have at least a phone conversation with in 1993
                    - I was in Saigon in connection with a POW/MIA trip - had been the extremely
                    youthful Minister of Labor when I was in Saigon in 1968. He wasn't much older
                    than I was. Then he was the deputy representative for South Vietnam at the Paris
                    Peace Talks for a time. After that he disappeared from view for years. Nobody
                    knew what had happened to him. It turned out that he had at some point gone back
                    to Vietnam and he, too, by 1993, was doing quite well as a businessman. We had a
                    good conversation. He had managed to adapt himself to the new system, which was
                    probably difficult, but nevertheless he did it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, we had four people studying Indonesian at that time. John Helble
                    who was about to go out to KL as political counselor. David Kenney who was going
                    to Surabaya and David's wife Helen. Helen was the best of us at the language.
                    She would just cruise through it. I had met Helen in Saigon before David did.
                    She was with the British Council as I recall. Helen was visiting Hue at Tet 1968
                    and was trapped behind NVA lines for a time. Anyway, that was our Indonesian
                    language class. There was one other fellow, from the Agency. A total of
                    five.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did that language reform come through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was developed by the Indonesian nationalist movement. It was one
                    of the real achievements of that generation of Indonesian leaders. They
                    basically settled on the easiest language in the archipelago. The default
                    language, I guess you'd call it. They fostered it as a second language for all
                    Indonesians. I think it's been a remarkably successful experiment. So,
                    fortunately, generations of Foreign Service Officers have been able to study
                    Malay rather than Javanese.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It's a little bit like falling off the edge of the earth, because
                    Indonesia in that period was very quiet. The upheaval of September 1967, when
                    Sukarno was essentially removed from the scene and Suharto took over, was far
                    enough in the past that things had settled down and the so-called New Order was
                    firmly in control. Politically I don't think anything was happening. If it was
                    it was very far beneath the surface and probably only in the vicinity of
                    Jakarta. The situation in Sumatra was really very quiet and the emphasis was on
                    rebuilding, on possibilities for economic development, reinvestment in rubber
                    plantations that had been allowed to run down, oil companies stepping up their
                    operations in various places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the rationale for having a consulate in
                        Medan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was established there around 1903. It was one of our older
                    Southeast Asian consulates. There was always an American presence up in the
                    northern part of Sumatra because of rubber plantations - Goodyear and Uniroyal.
                    Then eventually oil also became a factor. Oil production on Sumatra dates back a
                    long way. It was what interested the Japanese in getting there in a hurry in
                    World War II. So there was always a fair amount of American investment in
                    Sumatra. There was also a Christian missionary aspect to it I suspect. In
                    Sumatra, the coastal Malays were all Muslims, but in the mountains and in the
                    interior, the Batak population in particular, people were less affected by the
                    Arab merchants who had arrived by boat and spread Islam. So they were ripe for
                    plucking by Christian missionaries. There are an awful lot of Lutherans in North
                    Sumatra, and other denominations as well. That too probably was a reason for a
                    consulate.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Roger Sullivan was the consul when I arrived. He was replaced a few
                    months later by Mark Dion. Both were top notch. Coleman Parrot was our
                    administrative officer, a fine fellow. I came to like him a lot, and his lovely
                    wife, Julie, who had been a model in London. We had an agency fellow there, and
                    he and his wife became very good friends of mine and are to this day. We had a
                    couple of USIS guys rotate through, and a communicator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Four or five people? A fairly good sized mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. Six in fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your specific duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, I kind of styled myself as a political and economic reporter and
                    I would get in our Jeep and travel as far as the roads would allow me to travel.
                    You could get all the way to central Sumatra, but it was rough going because the
                    roads were just horrendous. They'd once been good, but they'd been neglected for
                    20 years and had fallen into complete disrepair. Although we had an admin
                    Officer, I think I had some administrative responsibility, taking care of
                    pouches, for example. Very occasionally there would be a consular issue. I dealt
                    with a drunken seaman once, the only time I've had to do that in my Foreign
                    Service career. I signed stuff that the locals prepared for my signature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the post had been there for some time, the housing had
                        probably been there for some time. Was it fairly decent housing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Housing was pretty good. My house was a Dutch bungalow, single story,
                    small lawn, a long row of rooms in a kind of a wing extending off to the back
                    which included my “godown” with my canned goods and all that in it, and rooms
                    for innumerable staff back there. I never knew exactly how many people were
                    living back there. In Saigon I had basically a cook and an old woman who would
                    clean. I thought that was pretty nifty in a rather large house. This was a
                    smaller house, and I had a cook. I had at least two cleaning ladies, one did
                    laundry, the other cleaned. I had my own gate guard, a tubercular man who had
                    been there forever I guess. The extended families of these people lived back
                    there and I'm sure I was never really in control of the situation. But the
                    living was pretty good. Medan was a city of about a million people, but it
                    looked like a small town and a rather pleasant one. Lots of that kind of
                    housing. A rather sizeable foreign community, with Dutch and other Europeans
                    connected to the oil business or the rubber business, mostly the rubber
                    business, or the palm oil business.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>There were several other consulates. The British had a consulate there. The
                    Japanese had a consulate. The Soviets had a very big consulate general. We had
                    pretty good relations with them. One of the great triumphs of our time, my time
                    in Medan, was the moon landing. Shortly after the moon landing USIA distributed
                    to all posts those wonderful pictures of the lunar-lander parting from the
                    mother ship and going down to the surface. I don't know if you've ever seen
                    those, but they were spectacular. We invited the Russians over to Roger
                    Sullivan's house for a showing, just to sort of rub it in a little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have meant that you actually had national day
                        celebrations in that community there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We certainly did. I guess I did two Fourths of July in Medan. Yes,
                    and I wonder how many of those consulates are still left. I'm quite sure the
                    British have closed theirs, but the Japanese may still be there. It's too bad.
                    I'm a proponent of constituent posts. I think closing them is always a loss to
                    the embassy in question and I think it's a loss to the Foreign Service. I think
                    they're great places, especially for younger officers, even though I was bored
                    out of my mind in Medan just because of the contrast with Saigon. Nevertheless,
                    it was a good post and I was very sorry to see that it was closed some years
                    ago. The DCM in Jakarta at the time I was there, who was my reviewing officer,
                    thought constituent posts were irrelevant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Medan as you were traveling around you
                        probably talked to Indonesian civil servants, the governor, the local
                        police, that was part of your reporting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The key person there was the commanding general, and I remember when
                    I was there he was an Ambonese, also a Christian; those sorts of considerations
                    were always borne in mind in the assignment to various areas of Indonesia of
                    these generals. It was well known that North Sumatra was a place where big money
                    could be made. Therefore, there was a rather frequent rotation of generals
                    through Medan so that they could all partake and then move on. But it was also
                    true that at that time, this may no longer be the case in the new democratic
                    Indonesia, but at that time it was basically the army's responsibility to fend
                    for itself, so by no means all the money that was extracted one way or another
                    from rubber plantations and places like that became the personal property of the
                    commanding general. Much of it went to build army barracks and feed the troops.
                    That was the system, but the generals in charge always ended up with some
                    themselves. I might add that I also got to know some military and police
                    generals who were men of the highest integrity. I still keep in touch with one
                    of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another time and place that you were talking about,
                        personal goods in storage. You're living in a city of a million, but it
                        doesn't have American supplies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. There were stores where if you looked carefully you
                    could find lots of things, but they were probably way outdated and very
                    expensive. Almost everybody in our consulate, and I think this was true of the
                    foreign community in Medan generally, ordered what they needed through
                    mail-order places in Europe. I don't know if you've ever come across any of
                    these. Remember their names? Justesen. That was one that we used.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it was always a big thing when the container arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nowadays you see the younger officers aren't going to
                        believe that there isn't a McDonalds on every corner in every city in the
                        world and how we got our personal goods - your laundry, your canned goods,
                        your whatever will come as a surprise. In fact you had to order them from
                        Europe which meant ordering in advance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it certainly did and not necessarily ordering well, especially
                    when you are a bachelor and you don't know anything about putting a house
                    together or what makes it run or what you really need. I got a lot of advice
                    from a couple of wives in the consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go ahead and take a break. You were saying Galbraith
                        was coming up for a visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I was alone in Medan almost literally. I think Mark Dion was in
                    Singapore for a weekend. Coleman Parrot, our administrative officer was away. I
                    got a phone call from Jakarta saying that the ambassador was going to be coming
                    up there in a matter of just a few days. It was on very short notice, an
                    ambassadorial visit. A big deal for us in Medan. It was akin to the Secretary of
                    State arriving at an embassy, relatively speaking. We had a good deal of
                    preparation to do - basically arranging a dinner and an overnight trip out to a
                    rubber plantation and that kind of thing. I got most of that done by the time
                    Mark returned. He was very grateful and we had a successful visit. The
                    ambassador as I recall had a large entourage, in the neighborhood of a dozen
                    people. I never did that to a consulate in Thailand</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he come commercial or did he come on a military

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think he came by commercial aircraft. There was a pretty regular
                    connection between Medan and Jakarta. It's possible he came by attach� aircraft,
                    but if so some of his people must have come commercial.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Each tour you have you're increasing your own skills and
                        you're observing the other officers around you. What was it like to work for
                        Roger Sullivan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Very good. Roger Sullivan was a brilliant Foreign Service Officer I
                    thought, a China specialist, a man very skeptical that anything good was going
                    to come out of Vietnam and who thought we should have cut our losses there long
                    before. Therefore, he and I had disagreements about that subject and he was
                    always a very convincing advocate for his point of view. I seldom got the best
                    of him in any discussion about Vietnam. He was a good boss, easy to get along
                    with. I enjoyed traveling with him. He had a very nice family and I was sort of
                    welcomed by them all. I liked him very much. He received his promotion to FSO-3
                    while he was there - this under the old system and he was a member - I guess not
                    a member of the senior Foreign Service as an old FSO-3, but at least it was a
                    good promotion. He thought it would open up lots of doors for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's your opening, mid-level, promotion. Three is now
                        either a one or a five, I forgot which way the system went.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Three is now a one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Yes, exactly. That would be '70 and that would be
                        the start of some interesting things on the China side and he then later got
                        involved in those things. All good things have to come to an end and the
                        Medan tour is over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The spring of '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, how do you get, when does that cable come in that
                        says here's your next job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I honestly don't remember what I did or exactly who I was in contact
                    with to make sure that my next job was the Paris Peace Talks. I don't know that
                    I actually went after that job with great fervor or whether it was offered to
                    me, but I was happy to have it. I would have preferred to have gone there
                    directly from Saigon in 1968, but going there in 1971 also interested me. I was
                    surprised, I suppose, that the Talks were still going on in 1971. I left Medan
                    in the spring of 1971, and traveled to Paris by way of Tunisia where I visited
                    Arch Calhoun, my former boss in Saigon. I got to Paris, it must have been in
                    April of '71, although I then went back to the United States and then turned
                    around and returned to Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The Paris Peace Talks by then had been going on for three years and not a whole
                    lot had been accomplished. The American delegation by that time was led by David
                    Bruce who I came to respect and admire, a very fine gentleman I thought. His
                    deputy was Phil Habib. So, I was once again in familiar territory. Steve Ledogar
                    was the press spokesman, Peter Collins, who had been with me in Saigon, was a
                    liaison officer and that is what I also became. I was also the admin guy for the
                    delegation the first year I was there, which entailed occasional arguments with
                    people in the embassy in Paris over such issues as whether we could continue to
                    use their spacious library. If you've ever been in the embassy in Paris you know
                    they have a marvelous paneled library - a wonderful room. We used that library
                    again in 1989 when I was in Paris for a conference on Cambodia. In any event I
                    had some administrative responsibility, but not that much. Then we had a change
                    in leadership in the delegation after I'd been there a few months. David Bruce
                    left, and William Porter, the former deputy ambassador in Saigon, former
                    ambassador to Algeria and at that time ambassador to Korea came from Seoul to
                    replace Bruce as head of the delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That change representing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Then Phil Habib went to Seoul to replace Bill Porter as ambassador to
                    Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that a normal rotation of people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: David Bruce was a high-profile political appointee on the order of an
                    Ellsworth Bunker, and appointing William Porter, however distinguished his
                    career might have been, represented a slight diminution in the status of the
                    post. I suppose that's because by then Henry Kissinger was engaged in his own
                    line of negotiation and really didn't much care what happened in Paris, except
                    that it was an operation we had to keep going because the North Vietnamese
                    themselves demanded that it continue. So, Porter became the chief of the
                    delegation. Phil left. Heyward Isham replaced Phil and became the deputy. Steve
                    Ledogar left and I became the press spokesman for the delegatioa far more
                    interesting job for me than being liaison officer and general factotum.</p>
                <p>I might add that something else happened at about that time which was somewhat
                    significant in my lifI married Sacie and acquired three wonderful stepchildren.
                    Whatever success I enjoyed subsequently, I owe to her, at least mostly. That was
                    in the summer of '72.</p>
                <p>So for the last year, roughly, that I was there I was the spokesman for the
                    delegation. That meant participating in a four-way, on-the-record press
                    conference following each plenary session of the Paris Talks, which always took
                    place on Thursday afternoons at the Hotel Majestic near the Arc de Triumph.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Four way, so American...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Viet Cong - called the “Provisional
                    Revolutionary Government” - and ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this is a big thing for the press, especially
                        American...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. The Paris press corps during the Vietnam Peace Talks
                    was much larger than before or since in terms of American representation and
                    probably in terms of other foreign representation also. When the Peace Talks
                    ended in January of '73 an awful lot of American newspapers closed up shop in
                    Paris. Many of the correspondents there had been with the subject since it began
                    in May of 1968 and at least some of them had a very good knowledge of the way
                    the talks had developed, the history of what had gone on, in a way that I really
                    did not. Therefore, they could be formidable questioners in a press conference
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually it's a daunting job to handle the press. Richard
                        Boucher seems to have permanently ensconced himself into that. As you say
                        you must have gotten some tough questions or slid off the podium once or
                        twice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, because the press corps was inclined to be highly skeptical of
                    any of our claims and critical of our position. Certainly that was true of the
                    foreign press and also true of some of the American press. What made it
                    especially difficult was that I was not an “authoritative” spokesman because
                    Henry Kissinger was doing secret negotiations while we were having our open
                    plenary sessions and the two could quite often diverge. The subject of our
                    plenary sessions sometimes, often, had nothing to do with what Henry was talking
                    about. Our talks had basically become exchanges of polemics, which as I
                    mentioned the North Vietnamese considered very valuable. This was a weekly
                    opening to the world for them. That's why they wanted it to continue even though
                    the real business was being done between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. As 1972 wore
                    on and Kissinger's activities became more and more open, or less and less secret
                    should I say, my job as spokesman got harder.</p>
                <p>In the beginning Kissinger would come and go into Paris, and no one would know
                    he'd been there except perhaps the head of our delegation. His travels were
                    arranged by the defense attach� in Paris, who later became chief of the CIA,
                    General Walters, Vernon Walters. He handled Henry's clandestine movements in and
                    out of Paris.</p>
                <p>By the summer of '72 it was well known that Kissinger was engaged in these talks.
                    By the fall of '72 his arrivals in Paris were no longer a secret although they
                    weren't advertised, but people knew he was there. Still later on there were
                    motorcycle paparazzi chasing him around as his motorcade moved from one point to
                    another. It became gradually more and more an open thing. As it did, and as
                    correspondents were clued in at least in a general way from briefings in
                    Washington and elsewhere about what was going on in the private talks, I'd get
                    interesting questions directed at me on these Thursday afternoon occasions and I
                    seldom knew any more than the journalists did about what might have
                    happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I was really under a constraint. I was not supposed to say anything about Henry
                    Kissinger's activities - how dare I. On a few occasions when I did, my wrist was
                    slapped and I was told not to do it again. I once ventured to characterize, for
                    example, the “tone” of Henry's meeting the previous day. I was informed that
                    Kissinger was displeased, and that so was Le Duc Tho, and that I should desist.
                    It was an untenable position for a press spokesman, when you don't really know
                    what's going on and you're not even allowed to say what you do know - and you're
                    dealing with a press corps that knows about as much as you do.</p>
                <p>I would also often get into exchanges having to do with American military
                    operations in Vietnafor example, whether or not a flood control dike with an
                    anti-aircraft position on top of it was or was not a legitimate military target.
                    One of my worst hecklers was the Australian communist writer, Wilfred Burchett.
                    I was frankly relieved when my press spokesmanship ended, although I had
                    appreciated the temporary notoriety it gave me. My mother occasionally saw me on
                    the nightly news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly must have been different, given the
                        initiative and challenge of being in Vietnam and then to be totally
                        circumscribed. I mean you can't get two more different ends of the whole
                        Foreign Service experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I suppose that's right. It was just a function of the fact that the
                    real negotiation was taking place elsewhere. The press was constantly probing to
                    see if they could get any insight through this one channel available to them
                    into the still essentially secret process. I may have been circumscribed, but
                    the job most certainly was challenging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of insights, you were saying at one time
                        Kissinger came through town and he briefed a group of Embassy officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Kissinger and Dick Smyser came through, and I suppose Winston Lord
                    must have been with him also. He met with our delegation and he talked with us
                    about his visit to South Vietnam, during which I think he was trying to get
                    Nguyen Van Thieu to agree to more forthcoming formulations that he could use in
                    his secret talks. He also discussed at some length his stopover in Pakistan and
                    briefed us on the situation on the subcontinent, in which I had no interest. I
                    couldn't understand why he felt it necessary to talk about that subject. Then he
                    left. He neglected to mention that he had also gone from Pakistan into Beijing,
                    secretly. William Porter was in on his secret, but nobody else in the delegation
                    was. Vernon Walters probably knew about it also. We read about it in the papers
                    a couple of days later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The talks finally do come to some resolution though,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, in October of 1972 Kissinger had his “peace is at hand” press
                    conference. One of those brilliant performances he was capable of. There were
                    some snags between that point and the final agreement, which caused us to
                    unleash B-52s over North Vietnam at Christmas 1972. We got an agreement then,
                    finally, in January of 1973. William Rogers, our Secretary of State, came to
                    Paris to sign the agreement. Kissinger had earlier initialed the agreement with
                    Le Duc Tho. We had an elaborate ceremony on, what was it, January 25, 23,
                    something like that, 1973 ending American participation in the Vietnam War. Our
                    withdrawal began immediately and POWs returned within the next month. South
                    Vietnam was more or less on its own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, did you leave Paris shortly after this? I mean
                        that must have been the end of the Peace Talks delegation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Porter left, but the delegation was to become the core of a joint
                    economic commission. I don't know if you remember that about the Vietnam Peace
                    Talks. We were going to give them lots of aid had this agreement worked out, and
                    a joint commission was to be established as part of the agreement and was to
                    begin its meetings immediately in Paris. So the delegation remained more or less
                    intact, but as I recall I had very little to do. By early April my family and I
                    were on a six week tour of Southern Europe, and shortly after we got back, I
                    left Paris. Needless to say the joint economic commission, if that indeed was
                    the name, never amounted to anything. My work ended essentially in January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started working on landing the next job. Did you call
                        them or did they call you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was time for me to go back to Washington. I hadn't served in
                    Washington in a real job since that disastrous first assignment. Again, I can't
                    remember whether somebody asked me to come back and be a sort of junior policy
                    officer in EA/RA (Office of Regional Affairs in the East Asia Bureau) or whether
                    I knew it was available and lobbied to get it. Maybe a little of both. By then I
                    was comfortable with the East Asia Bureau. I had begun to make a name for myself
                    within the Bureau and it's possible that I knew enough about the flow chart that
                    I was able to identify that job and maneuver myself into it. In any event, I
                    went to EA/RA in the spring of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of regional affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Bob Martens. His deputy was Dick Nethercut, another China guy, right?
                    Both good men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh and Louise McNutt was in the office. Do you know her or do you
                    know who she was?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was there forever, wasn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, forever. She was the daughter of Governor Paul McNutt of
                    Indiana, who was one of FDR's great political rivals within the Democratic Party
                    and had been sent off to the Philippines as Governor General to sort of get him
                    out of FDR's way. So Louise spent her girlhood in the governor's mansion in
                    Manila, at least a few years of it. A wonderful woman with an office piled high
                    with every UN publication that had ever been cranked out. One time our Pentagon
                    liaison told her he had hidden a secret document in her bookshelves, and she
                    would have to find it. Louise was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But isn't that the point, the regional affairs office in
                        the State Department bureaus, I don't want to say was the “pick up” office,
                        but they covered the broader, intra-regional issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was a collection of very disparate functions. Louise was our
                    United Nations officer and I think was pretty good at knowing what was happening
                    at the UN and how it might affect what we were doing. There was a POL/MIL
                    function - the guy in EA/RA kind of liaised with PM as well as with the
                    individual country offices. Harriet Isom was in the office, in fact, I replaced
                    her, and one of my functions was “SEATO affairs”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, goodness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had a vault, the “SEATO vault,” as if something secret had been
                    produced that required being kept in a vault. I think during my tenure that job
                    ended and the vault was cleaned out. SEATO was officially put to rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are your responsibilities? You're a fourth tour
                        officer now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, my title was “policy officer” and I did have an actual
                    policy-related job, which was to design and disseminate to the field - and hope
                    for cooperation from the field - annual policy analysis and resource allocation
                    documents. Do you remember those things? PARA was one acronym for them and they
                    had others as the years went by. They were taken seriously by some posts and not
                    at all seriously by others. It was my job to put the thing together, to get it
                    out to the field, to keep track of who had responded and who hadn't and to do
                    whatever we had to do with it when the submission was made. Dave Osborn was the
                    ambassador in Burma at that time, and he really took it seriously. He thought it
                    ought to be redesigned, and he reportedly spent hours with his office floor
                    covered with papers and flow charts, and he sent in something that was quite
                    interesting that I'm sure nobody really looked at. He probably had time on his
                    hands in Rangoon.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Then, as 1973 moved into 1974, Vietnam was beginning to fail and the frailty and
                    the flaws in the Paris Agreement on Vietnam were becoming more and more evident
                    and the North Vietnamese military had moved into the South in a big way. They
                    were putting pressure on Saigon on many fronts and it was pretty clear that
                    things were headed down the drain. This continued to be a major preoccupation of
                    the bureau, of course, and I got drawn back into the Vietnam business from my
                    EA/RA position. I was interested in what was happening and put myself forward
                    and was increasingly involved in writing papers related to the situation and
                    writing congressional presentations, all that sort of thing. By the second half
                    of 1974 I was probably working on Vietnam more than anything else.</p>
                <p>John Helbe was Phil Habib's special assistant. Phil being the Assistant Secretary
                    at this point. One of my more vivid experiences while in EARA was attending the
                    1974 chiefs of mission meeting in Honolulu, December of '74. I went there, I
                    guess technically, because I was the policy officer and we were supposed to be
                    talking to ambassadors about those PARA documents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now a chiefs of mission meeting, isn't that where the
                        ambassadors from that region all get together and share their experiences
                        hopefully with the thought that one person's experience is going to improve
                        the others' performance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. For years it had been traditional to do it in Honolulu
                    in December. That was still the practice when I was in Bangkok. I'm not sure
                    whether budgetary or other things have interrupted that tradition, probably so.
                    In any event I went to that meeting. As I said, I had a faint excuse
                    theoretically because of my titular job as policy officer, but I really went
                    there because of the Vietnam aspect of it. We knew that Vietnam was going to be
                    an important agenda topic and John Helble was good enough to make sure that I
                    got on the airplane.</p>
                <p>I remember it quite vividly - at least I remember the tenor of the exchanges that
                    took place on the subject of Vietnam. Particularly at a Sunday morning
                    discussion we had at a private estate right on the ocean, on the North shore of
                    Oahu. Some rich person's place had been given over to us for the day. We went
                    out there by helicopter and sat around the pool and the subject was primarily
                    Vietnam and Cambodia. Although the day started with a briefing by a guy from the
                    EB (Economics) bureaMike Ely maybe - on the 1974 trade act, an important new
                    piece of legislation. When the discussion turned to Vietnam there was a lot of
                    tension in the air because of the bitter feelings of Graham Martin toward Phil
                    Habib and toward Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Graham Martin was quite sure that Washington could and should be doing more to
                    help our friends in South Vietnam. Phil Habib was explaining to him and to the
                    others assembled around the pool the political realities of 1974 in the United
                    States, particularly after the election of an overwhelmingly more Democratic,
                    young and very anti-war House of Representativethe so-called “class of '74.” So,
                    I was aware of the problem that existed between Graham Martin and Phil Habib
                    because I guess it was semi-public, but John Helble also kind of kept me up to
                    date, describing the occasional telegram that I wouldn't have seen from Graham
                    Martin to Phil. Martin seemed to be convinced that Washington generally and Phil
                    in particular could be doing more than was being done to stem the tide. John
                    Gunther Dean was also present and he had equally gloomy things to say about the
                    situation in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder about some of the other observers, I think
                        Kintner would have been there from Thailand and Ambassador Unger would have
                        been there from the Republic of China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall what they had to say in the Vietnam discussion. I
                    don't remember details of the discussiojust the atmospherics of it. I do
                    remember Ambassador Unger arriving with a briefing book that must have been six
                    inches thick, literally. Such a detail guy. A very nice man, but I couldn't
                    believe it when I saw this thing he was carrying around with him.</p>

                    what he needed with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, actually, what you're really saying here is that
                        domestic political changes have occurred that will impact on the conduct of

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, absolutely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right, and by then the public had generally stopped supporting
                    this effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your vantage point is regional affairs. The public support
                        stops and still that's a hard thing to watch. I mean you had been there. You
                        had Vietnam experience, but now you're working with the Hill, you're doing
                        papers.</hi>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, as I said, in 1974 there'd been an influx of new almost
                    exclusively anti-war Democrats into the House. I went with Phil Habib one
                    afternoon to a large room in the capitol building where we met with the House
                    Democratic caucus. It couldn't have been all of them. I don't think there were
                    250 people in the room, but there were an awful lot, including people like Phil
                    Burton of San Francisco, Bella Abzug and Patsy Mink. Just outrageously outspoken
                    people. It was a very tough meeting. I wasn't doing the talking, Phil was. I was
                    just his spear-carrier. It was a kind of an eye opener to be in the same room
                    with that much anti-war sentiment all at one time. It felt good to escape from
                    it. That was indicative of the atmosphere. We were asking, incidentally, for
                    $750 million more in military aid in the spring of 1975 for Saigon. In 1975 that
                    was real money, you know. Congress was not inclined to provide any.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's certainly one of the lessons that you ultimately
                        learned in this business: whatever policy you're pursuing has to be publicly
                        acceptable, but most Foreign Service Officers to a fourth assignment don't
                        get a real live exposure to those political currents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We were all exposed to those currents with respect to Vietnam, at
                    least after I left Saigon in 1968 and as the situation worsened. You couldn't be
                    unaware of the political reality surrounding the Vietnam issue. But it was
                    interesting to brush up against it first hand as I did quite a lot in the spring
                    of 1975, going up to the Hill with Phil and also a couple of times as part of
                    Kissinger's entourage for those huge hearings of the House and Senate Armed
                    Services Committees.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right, I was in the Ops Center that night.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I'm sure it was not coincidental. The bureau must have had some kind
                    of special watch going on.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It wasn't just that day, but a number of days leading up to it. I
                    remember sitting in a small room with Phil and with Larry Eagleburger that
                    night, and I have a copy someplace of Saigon's last telegram, signing off. Also,
                    during that period when it became evident that Saigon was going down the tubes,
                    there was a lot of preliminary work that got underway on the refugee front and I
                    was in on some of it. Frank Wisner was a prime mover in that. I forget where
                    Frank was working at that point. A number of people were involved. I met with
                    them a couple of times, and we were talking in a preliminary way about how this
                    likely large influx of people was going to be handled, before it became an
                    official government project. Then after the fall of Saigon, I remember going
                    with Phil and Wisner to a hearing before Ted Kennedy's subcommittee. He had a
                    subcommittee that had to do with refugee issues. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, because I always have refugees starting with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He had a guy by the name of Jerry Tinker. Do you remember that
                    name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that sounds familiar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Jerry was a classmate of mine at Redlands and he was for years
                    Kennedy's staffer on refugee issues. Kennedy chaired a hearing on...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had Cuban refugees and all that sort of stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: ...on preparations for handling the exodus from Vietnam. Then about
                    the last thing Vietnam-related that I did and about the last thing I did in
                    EA/Rthat must have been within a week of the fall of Saigon - we got a memo from
                    Brent Scowcroft, a Scowcroft-Springsteen memo in which the Department was asked
                    to provide the White House a paper on the “lessons of Vietnam.” I became the
                    chief author of that and I collected a lot of views from people in the bureau.
                    Everybody had things to say. I wrote that memo, Bob Miller cleared it and Phil
                    signed it and it went back through the Springsteen-Scowcroft channel. I got a
                    copy a few years later and have since acquired a legitimate declassified copy
                    through the FOI process. It's a good memo - the sort of thing we might have done
                    well to read carefully before our latest adventure in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me take you back to a couple of things that you've
                        mentioned. Planning ahead for refugees. There's a tension here between

                        and the need to plan to ahead.</hi>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and so there were these informal meetings that took place, and I
                    was kind of on the margins of those as I said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't a refugee bureau at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Is that right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm fairly certain. It comes to me as a result of all
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It probably came about in the Carter administration, right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think so. One of the things that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: After 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape three. We were discussing post-fall of Saigon
                        refugee thinking. You were saying that policy initiation was at a different
                        level than you. You were on the side, so who was thinking refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, not necessarily on a different level, but I wasn't as
                    intimately involved as people like Lionel Rosenblatt and I think Frank Wisner
                    and a few other guys who really did a lot to lay the groundwork for what became
                    a plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the ultimate circumstance they faced was rescuing
                        people at sea, getting them to the Philippines, arranging for countries of
                        first asylum to accept the refugees. I mean that was a major effort there,
                        but yet let's see you actually come out of regional affairs shortly after
                        the fall of Saigon, so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I shifted gears very soon thereafter, and I was never directly
                    involved in the big refugee program, other than that we had a Vietnamese refugee
                    family living with us for a few months that fall and winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying you were in the Ops Center with Larry
                        Eagleburger when the news comes over. What did the room feel like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, it wasn't a “you could have heard a pin drop” type situation.
                    Everybody knew what was happening and undoubtedly everybody had their own
                    thoughts on the subject as that last telegram came in. I remember Phil and Larry
                    Eagleburger reacting quite normally to the evening's events, as they both were
                    inclined to do, with very little phasing them. To me it was a huge thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It brought down the curtain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. It was a very moving and emotional evening for me and I'm sure
                    for lots of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, now having spent all your time overseas, you can't get
                        out of Washington. Your next assignment is to the Japan desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It actually worked pretty well for me. I'd gotten married when we
                    were in Paris and I acquired three stepchildren, so it was rather good for us to
                    establish ourselves as a family and have a semi-normal life in the Washington,
                    D.C. area, in Alexandria, Virginia, from the summer of '73 until the summer of
                    '77. In '75 after two years in EA/RA I joined the Japan desk. That was a very
                    good move for me. I'm extremely glad I did it.</p>
                <p>In that case it was Bill Sherman, the Country Director, it was Bill Sherman's
                    initiative. He came to me and asked me if I would be interested in becoming
                    deputy director of the Japan desk. I certainly was. I wanted to broaden my
                    horizons. Japan loomed larger in our thinking then than it seems to in 2004.
                    Bill Sherman was a man that I had gotten to know a little bit and I admired him,
                    so I was very happy to move around the corner in the bureau to the Japan
                    desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you're deputy director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A deputy directorship is a major assignment in the State
                        Department, so he obviously had a very high opinion of you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I think he did and I appreciated that at the time, and I've
                    always appreciated Bill's tutelage and mentoring - all of that that he provided
                    over the years to me. He was the best Foreign Service boss I ever had. Quiet,
                    soft spoken, very wise in the ways of bureaucracy, wonderfully knowledgeable
                    about Japan and policy toward Japan and policy toward lots of other things, and
                    just a very good teacher. It was a great opportunity for me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was quite small. Six officers and three secretaries; might have
                    been seven officers, but certainly no more than that.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. Yes, I think we had a POL/MIL specialist.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: By then, Okinawa was once again fully part of Japan. I joined the
                    desk just a few weeks in advance of the visit to the United States by Emperor
                    Hirohito which was a very big deal in U.S.-Japan relations, and significant in
                    U.S.-Japan history I think. A tremendous amount of preparation had gone into
                    that visit as you can imagine. The Japanese being as careful as they are about
                    anything like that and doubly so when the emperor was involved. It was a highly
                    choreographed operation, but there was very good symbolism to it. I think it in
                    a sense put a final “period” to one important phase in U.S.-Japan history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there particular highlights that one side or the
                        other wanted in the schedule as particularly symbolic or were both sides
                        pretty much on the same track, oh yes, he should see this, he should do
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't remember any particular controversies over the schedule. He
                    was elderly at that time of course. We had a wonderful welcoming ceremony on the
                    South Lawn and that was followed by a reception in the East Room of the White
                    House. Sacie and I just made the cut for that event. We went through a receiving
                    line and shook hands with the Emperor of Japan, which no Japanese could have
                    ever imagined doing. Then that evening we didn't qualify for the State dinner,
                    but we did qualify for the “after dinner entertainment” which meant white tie
                    and tails and fancy dresses for the ladies. We were ushered in through the south
                    portico and went upstairs, as I remember, to the main north entrance to the
                    White House where once again there was a receiving line, where we once again
                    shook hands with the emperor. Then there was a little orchestra and there was
                    dancing right there on the marble foyer in the White House. Gerald Ford took the
                    floor first with Ginger Rogers, who was a little long in the tooth but still
                    very graceful on the dance floor, as was Gerald Ford, so it was a great evening,
                    a great day.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The substantive issue that I remember most from that job, 1975 to 1977, was the
                    so-called Lockheed scandal. Lockheed or its agents had allegedly attempted to
                    bribe some Japanese politicians to improve prospects for the sale of, probably,
                    the P-3 (anti-submarine warfare aircraft) and it became a huge scandal in Japan.
                    There were reverberations back across the Pacific. Frank Church, who was
                    chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, seized the issue and held
                    hearings on it. I think there was an investigation of some kind that preceded
                    the hearings, and I got very much involved in the Department's response to that
                    whole process. It included among other things passing information back and forth
                    between the Japanese government and the congress. We were sort of the conduit
                    for information requests from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which were
                    conveyed to us by Chuck Meissner, the late Chuck Meissner. Moose and Meissner,
                    remember?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I thought it was Moose and Lowenstein?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, it was Moose and Meissner at first. He was an assistant
                    secretary of commerce in the Clinton Administration and was on Ron Brown's
                    airplane in Yugoslavia, unfortunately. Anyway, Meissner was the staffer involved
                    and I was the middle man, and the Japanese Embassy officer involved was a good
                    fellow by the name of Kazuo Ogura, who became a very senior Gaimusho (Ministry
                    of Foreign Affairs) official. As a result of all that, the Foreign Corrupt
                    Practices Act was born.</p>
                <p>We had visits by Japanese prime ministers as always happens. There were two of
                    them during my two years, two different prime ministers. I was involved in those
                    visits. Prime Ministers Miki and Fukuda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's LDP (Liberal Democratic Party) prime ministers,
                        still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prime ministers. Was there any particular significance to

                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall. I think it was essentially internal LDP politics.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I remember flying on Fukuda's airplane from Washington to San Francisco on his
                    return to Japan. Evan Dobelle was also on that airplane and I sat next to him.
                    He was the chief of protocol under Jimmy Carter. I guess this was very early
                    Carter Administration. This would have been early '77. We landed in San
                    Francisco and were met by the city's chief of protocol, Cyril Magnin of the I.
                    Magnin department store family. He was a very nice, elderly gentleman and had
                    been doing this for years. He organized the San Francisco portion of Fukuda's
                    visit. I rode in from the airport with George Moscone, the mayor of San
                    Francisco, who was an attractive guy. He was killed not long after in the Harvey
                    Milk shooting incident. We had dinner at a fancy hotel and Cyril Magnin I think
                    was a little embarrassed because the evening was so dominated by San Francisco's
                    Italians, not only Moscone, but a lot of other people whom he considered a
                    little bit nouveau riche and not very sophisticated. His reaction was amusing.
                    It was a nice event.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that fairly typical for the deputy director to escort a

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, I don't know how typical it is. It was just something that Bill
                    Sherman let me do. I wasn't “escorting” the Prime Minister, but I was a member
                    of his party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We were traveling on a chartered Japan Air Lines (JAL) aircraft. It
                    was Fukuda's personal plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, there were certainly enough Japanese embassy people
                        there, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sitting in Washington you must, and having done it in the
                        field, the presidential visit, you must have looked out the window and
                        thought “I know what the embassy, the Japanese embassy guys are going
                        through.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right, although I guess up to then I had not done a
                    presidential visit. I did my only presidential visit in fact in Japan in
                    1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when you're on the desk you had the opportunity,
                        which is fairly typical at that time of making an orientation trip to your
                        post. Had you not been stationed in Japan, you probably passed through Japan
                        to get to Saigon because that's a great circle route and all that. What did
                        your introduction to Japan, how did that strike you in October of '76? You
                        went to Honolulu first, you probably saw the CINCPAC people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. I first visited Japan in 1965 on an R&amp;R from Saigon. You
                    could do that sort of thing. I flew into Tachikawa air base, which by 1976 had
                    been closed down. Japan in 1965 was still a far cry from an economic super
                    power. It was interesting to go back and see it again in 1976. I was impressed
                    by the sense of power that you felt around you in Tokyo, sort of a pulsing
                    energy and the same kind of feeling you get in some other Asian cities now - the
                    same sort of feeling you get now in Beijing, and in Tokyo, still. Things are
                    happening, really moving.</p>
                <p>I spent a good deal of time with Nick Platt, because by then I knew I would be
                    replacing him the following summer. I met many of the people at the Gaimusho
                    (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) who I would later get to know very well. I went
                    with Nick to a couple of Gaimusho-hosted dinners in cozy little Japanese
                    restaurants, with serving girls, the modern equivalent of geishaunbelievably
                    expensive evenings I'm sure, but Gaimusho funds at that time seemed to be
                    unlimited. I talked with lots of people in the embassy, in all sections. I'm
                    sure I met people from USFJ, although I don't recall specifics. I visited
                    Sapporit turned out to be my only trip to Hokkaido, unfortunately. A fascinating
                    place, I thought, a distinct variant of Japanese culture. I was hosted there by
                    Larry Farrar, the consul general, as I was a few days later by the ConGen in
                    Naha. One of the things I remember from the Naha visit was looking out over the
                    plain and the sea from the consul general's residence and watching an SR-71
                    circling to lanit no doubt having just returned from a run along the DMZ in
                    Korea. I stopped in Honolulu on the way out for a briefing and I'm sure I paid a
                    courtesy call on the Admiral. I stopped in San Francisco on the way back where I
                    met my parents. We had a nice few days together, touring wine country among
                    other places. During my absence, Carter had beaten Ford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point you're on a desk in Washington at the time
                        of a change in administrations. My experience is this is the time of
                        drafting transition papers where recent history and policies are summed up.
                        How did that process sweep through the Japan desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't remember specific papers quite frankly, Dave, but I know that
                    was the process. Everybody did it. “Where are we going” kinds of papers for the
                    new guy coming in. I think we learned fairly early on that our new guy was going
                    to be Dick Holbrooke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Old Saigon friends getting together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I suppose. Actually I was happy to leave the bureau when Dick came
                    in. Partly, perhaps, because I still considered him a peer and felt
                    uncomfortable about the idea of his being my big boss. Partly also because his
                    style bothered ma little too aggressive for my taste. I was pretty well
                    convinced that I'd be better off watching his performance from a distance. Japan
                    seemed about right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're doing these papers. I guess what I wanted to ask
                        was there any particular policy that you thought needed to be highlighted as
                        you passed things on to your replacement or was Japan fairly stable at that
                        time. I know the reversion of Okinawa had earlier been a very major
                        event.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, that was done and I think in 1977 the relationship was in pretty
                    stable condition. Indeed during the entire time I was in Japan it seemed to me
                    that it fundamentally was. I had an interesting job there because I was dealing
                    with foreign policy issues, but the bilateral relationship was steady, and in
                    good shape. We had just appointed Mike Mansfield; that happened before I left
                    the desk in the spring of 1977. That met with everyone's great acclaim. I
                    thought he was a wonderful choice.</p>
                <p>Mansfield had first visited Japan in the '20s, as a young Marine returning from
                    China. He had a lifelong interest in Asia and in addition was a distinguished
                    political leadeSenate Majority Leader longer than anyone else before or since.
                    He was a man of great ag75 or so at the timwhich alone was enough to earn him
                    the respect of the Japanese. And as I got to know him, which I was lucky enough
                    to do, I admired his modesty, his unassuming nature, his warmth. All of those
                    qualities made him a wonderful ambassador. One of his favorite phrases was that
                    the U.S.-Japan relationship was “the most important bilateral relationship in
                    the world, bar none.” That might have been an arguable proposition, but
                    Mansfield believed it, and so did I.</p>
                <p>I have a photo of him over there on the wall, with a very generous inscription.
                    One of my favorite souvenirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say one of the things that happens in
                        Washington at that presidential transition time, you do the transition
                        papers as a handoff and then you often get a new ambassador, particularly
                        Japan haa long line of outstanding political leaders, that's a political
                        appointee job. The desk has a major responsibility to Mansfield in his
                        hearings; to brief him up. Do you go to him or is there an office at the
                        Japan desk? How is he introduced to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't know that we had an office for him, but he came into the
                    Japan desk a number of times during that period. I had the good fortune of going
                    around town with him to call on various people. The Undersecretary of the
                    Treasury. Bob Strauss, who was the Special Trade Representative at the time.
                    Commerce Secretary, I don't remember who that was. I went with Mansfield on all
                    those Washington calls and he was a wonderful man to be around. I also went with
                    him up to the Hill, where his Senate colleagues gave him a going away reception
                    in a room in the Capitol. It was very nice, to see him lionized by his peers as
                    he was. I felt very privileged to witness that. I really liked Mansfield and I
                    got to know him pretty well in my three years in Japan, and kept up with him at
                    least occasionally in the years that followed. I called on him in his downtown
                    office not too long before he died. I admired him very much, and I appreciated
                    having an opportunity to work for him and get acquainted with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are major responsibilities of the desk, the
                        transition stuff, the new ambassador. Mansfield obviously had done a lot of
                        traveling, he knows the Foreign Service, so he probably felt very
                        comfortable coming onboard. As you said, your next move is from the desk as
                        deputy chief of the political section of the embassy in Tokyo. Tokyo's
                        expensive. Why did you want to go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, really it was a great job, because Japan was and is an
                    important country and we have such very important relations with them. There was
                    a need for, for want of a better term, “coordination,” so that we could speak
                    with the same voice toward third-country issues, international issues. So the
                    external affairs portfolio, which was what I had in addition to my title as
                    deputy, was a really good one. It meant that I worked with the Gaimusho on a
                    daily basis, and I developed great respect for the Gaimusho and its ability to
                    represent Japan to the world, and respect for the individual talent of so many
                    of its officers, especially the ones in the American affairs track, who were the
                    best. There were many young Foreign Service Officers in middle grades and some
                    at sort of the early senior level with whom I worked directly and who later rose
                    to the top of the Japanese Foreign Service. Ambassadors to Washington and vice
                    ministers and things like that.</p>
                <p>The other reason it was a good job was because of the quality of the people in
                    the embassy. Mansfield was the ambassador, Bill Sherman was the wonderful DCM,
                    Al Seligmann was my prickly, but brilliant boss and I had a lot of respect for
                    him. Then there were all the other good people in the political section. Tom
                    Hubbard was the internal affairs guy. Bob Immerman was the labor attach� and his
                    deputy was Chris LaFleur. Bill Breer was the political-military man. His deputy
                    was Don Keyser, who typed letter-perfect telegrams at 75 words per minute on his
                    IBM Selectric. I had working directly for me, as my external unit, Craig
                    Drunkenly, Mark Minton and Mark Mohr. A great bunch of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was and that's a great list of names, but something you
                        said earlier. There was a Japan crowd. You often say there's a Japan crowd,
                        there's a China crowd, how did you crowd into these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The only senior job in the political section that allowed for that
                    was the one that I had, the external affairs portfolio. Nick Platt had had it
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was non-language designated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was non-language designated. We were working with these superb
                    English speakers in the Gaimusho. I managed to get to Japan that way. Yes, most
                    of the members of the political section were new or in some cases old members of
                    the “Japan club.” They had done two years of language and some were on their
                    second tour. They intended to spend much of their careers working on Japan and
                    on U.S.-Japan relations. It was a high quality group. It was a specialty that
                    attracted real talent and I am sure still does.</p>

                        comes in and says it wants to reduce troops in Korea. Korea is in Japan's

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, that troubled the Japanese needless to say. We always tried to
                    put the best possible interpretation on what Washington was saying and doing on
                    that issue. They were bothered by it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. The Carter approach to Korea was a matter of concern to the
                    Japanese. A lot of things happened in Korea during the time I was in Japan.
                    There was the assassination of Park Chung Hee and all that followed, eventually
                    the Kwangju massacre, which happened while I was still in Japan in the spring of
                    '80. Bill Gleysteen, the ambassador in Korea, came to Tokyo a couple of times at
                    least while I was there, once shortly after the assassination of Park and the
                    assumption of control by Chun Doo Hwan, basically to brief the Japanese. They
                    had their own embassy in Korea obviously, but they very much welcomed Bill's
                    insights into what was going on. I went with Bill to all of his meetings and it
                    was fascinating. I was extremely impressed with Bill Gleysteen, always had been.
                    I had not had much contact with him before, but he was so articulate and so
                    thoughtful and so clear in his explanations that I couldn't help but be greatly
                    impressed. So, I'm sure, were the Japanese.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I suppose at least up to the vice minister of the Gaimusho. Then he
                    had a couple of dinners with senior people who were very anxious to hear what he
                    had to say. Bill asked me to be his political counselor before I left Japan. I
                    was pretty tempted. I relied in part on Bill Sherman's advice as to what I ought
                    to do next. He thought it would be good for me to go off to the RCDS, so I did
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're illustrating how issues in third countries impact on
                        our bilateral relationship and how the bilateral relationship responds to
                        that. Isn't this the same period as Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and our response to that,
                    which meant keeping as much political pressure as we possibly could on the
                    Soviets and that included of course generating a boycott of the 1980 Olympics,
                    which was one of the issues that we dealt with in Japan. They reluctantly agreed
                    to go along with us and they did not attend the 1980 Olympics.</p>
                <p>The Iran hostage crisis was happening as well and the Japanese were helpful to
                    us, as I recall. They had an embassy in Tehran which was a good listening post
                    and they had a very well connected Iranian ambassador in Tokyo who had been a
                    confidant of the Ayatollah Khomeini. There was something of a channel of
                    information there.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Just about anything significant that happened internationally during that period
                    was somehow on our agenda. If you're in any embassy you're going to get
                    instructions relating to things that happen half a world away, but that occurred
                    more often in Japan than in most other places, and there were probably more
                    often action requests connected to such messages, because we wanted Japanese
                    support, expected it in a lot of these situations. The Japanese were not always
                    totally anxious to give it, but they usually came through.</p>
                <p>In a larger sense, we were always talking with the Japanese about their role in
                    the world. We encouraged Japanese activism in foreign policy, because we knew
                    that if they exerted their influence, it would bolster ours. We were of course
                    aware of the political constraints under which the GOand Gaimusho
                    professionallabored. The Gaimusho was almost always “out in front” of the rest
                    of the government, the Diet and the public at large when it came to the idea of
                    Japan being more activist internationally. Even today, the Japanese are mulling
                    over what their role should be, and activism is still considered controversial.
                    When I was working there, almost 30 years ago now, the constraintpolitical and
                    even constitutionawere much stronger.</p>

                        it's a very close relationship in which you probably talked of Africa and
                        Asia. You were talking about Russians seeking political asylum during the

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had several incidents of people seeking political asylum from
                    Russia, from the Soviet Union. I can't remember how many members of the
                    Leningrad Symphony ended up under our care during my time there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: They sought political asylum and we provided it. But we had one bona
                    fide defector case - a Soviet KGB colonel. It was an important defection. My
                    involvement in that, apart from being up much of the night, was to inform the
                    GOJ, which I did in a very early-morning meeting in the Gaimusho, and to ask for
                    their cooperation in getting the fellow out of the country.</p>

                        was it something other than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was for the 1979 Economic Summit. The first of those things to be
                    held in Japan. I guess it was the G-7 in those days. It was I'm sure a typical
                    presidential visit. All the other presidents and prime ministers and their
                    entourages were comfortably housed in the New Otani, a huge high rise hotel near
                    the Akasaka Detached Palace where the meetings were to be held. We of course
                    needed something much more than that and so we decided on the Okura Hotel, which
                    was at the time the best hotel in the city and right across from our embassy. We
                    made do with 600 rooms thertwo-thirds of the hotel's capacity. So, we had a few
                    members of the cabinet as well as the president and all that that entails. Bill
                    Sherman, the DCM, was the control officer and I was his assistant. I spent a lot
                    of time with the pre-advance team of a dozen or so individuals. Lots more with
                    the advance team, 60 or so. Then all my waking hours as the visit drew near.
                    Have you been in a presidential visit?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have. That's a point I think to emphasize here.
                        Tokyo is a large embassy. You've got a lot of people. We've got one in
                        Bangkok, but these visits are actually major, require major allocations of
                        officer time and effort. I mean you have, but you're allocating assigning
                        officers to individual cars to see that the darn things work and they've got
                        gas and nothing can go wrong, so everything has to be done in great detail
                        which means the embassy stops, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, certainly anything of low priority quickly gets wiped off the
                    agenda and the visit takes absolute top priority over everything else.
                    Individual officers have to be assigned to each venue, there are officers
                    assigned to motorcades for example, all of those things have to be done. This
                    was a state visit for the president in addition to his participation in the
                    Economic Summit, so there was some travel involved, some events that took place
                    outside of Tokyo. Immense logistical preparation was of course required for all
                    of that. Tremendous demands were made of the Japanese government, and more than
                    once we came up against the inherent rigidities of the Japanese decision-making
                    system. The Japanese would want everything thoroughly orchestrated well in
                    advance and it was always very difficult to change plans at the last moment.
                    Anything not conforming to the graven-in-stone plan was very hard to get
                    approval for from the Japanese. We ran into that during the Carter visit.</p>
                <p>Occasionally we simply ran roughshod over the Japanese, as we do routinely with
                    presidential visits wherever they may be. We do things that are embarrassing to
                    the embassy, that require the embassy to go around and mend fences afterwards. I
                    think this is always part of a presidential visit. The role of the embassy is to
                    make it work for the president, and to the extent possible limit the bruises
                    among local officials. It always is an important political event for the host
                    country and in that sense, generally speaking, a major “success,” but there
                    always also are abraded feelings among people on their side, in this case the
                    Japanese side, whose sensibilities have been trampled upon by advance teams or
                    some other part of the visit machinery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at that point for a minute because I've found
                        that advance teams representing the president really don't care what country
                        they're in or what society they're in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It could be Pittsburgh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's an incredible lack of sensitivity and in one sense
                        any lack of what the economy can provide for them. Advance people are the
                        first ones the embassy wants to strangle before they get to the real
                        delegation. How did you find advance people? I mean the security guys are
                        tough enough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I thought that Carter's advance people were quite good. The team had
                    a very young chief. I think he was in his late '20s. He was running a very big
                    operation. He was a professional advance man. I respected his abilities. We got
                    along pretty well. I got a very nice letter out of it at the end of the trip -
                    one of the nicest of those things I ever received. Yes, you're quite right, they
                    are fixated on doing exactly what they believe the president wants or what they
                    believe is best for the president. It makes absolutely no difference whether
                    that fits or does not fit with realities in the host country. So, you're bound
                    to have conflicts and you just have to kind of try to massage the hurt feelings
                    of your host country counterparts after wheels-up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned off line that when Carter came he wanted to
                        do some jogging or something there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right, he was a jogger and he was staying in the ambassador's
                    residence right across from the Okura Hotel. He had tried jogging in the small
                    backyard of the residence once and he didn't like it. By then he had been to the
                    Akasaka Palace for the first meeting of the Economic Summit and its grounds were
                    very spacious, beautiful, 50 or 60 acres, and he thought, why can't I jog there?
                    So, we informed the Japanese that the following morning the president would like
                    to go jogging at the Akasaka Palace and the Japanese immediately said, that's
                    not possible. We had a meeting that night in the Okura Hotel between the
                    Japanese police, who were the ones who had vetoed the idea, and ourselves,
                    ourselves being myself and Chuck Kartman who was my number one assistant as well
                    as my motorcade man, and we tried to get the Japanese to let the president go
                    jogging in the Akasaka Palace grounds the following morning. The Japanese police
                    were absolutely adamant. There were two Gaimusho fellows there trying to be
                    intermediaries between us and the Japanese police. That was the only time I ever
                    saw a Japanese official cry.</p>
                <p>The Japanese police were everywhere during that visit and the city was completely
                    shut down. It was a very bizarre scene. Jimmy Carter could have jogged down the
                    middle of the Ginza quite safely I'm sure, but the Japanese police would not let
                    him use the palace grounds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that, as we all often experience, there is
                        a point past which you have to make apologies for how a couple of things
                        came down. I think in this visit you were saying...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, in this visit the president of course called on the emperor in
                    the palace, and the audience with the emperor was obviously limited in numbers.
                    The president and a few of his top people. One of the people who made the cut
                    for that event was Dick Holbrooke. Incidentally I remember when the advance team
                    came to Tokyo and we were talking about some event and went down a list of
                    people and the advance man said, “Who's Dick Holbrooke?” Another member of the
                    advance team said, “Oh, he's one of Vance's guys.” It put a different
                    perspective on who was a big shot and who was not within our system. In any
                    event, for the call on the emperor, Dick Holbrooke was one of the participants,
                    and the dozen or so people who were allowed into the reception room proceeded
                    toward it. Apparently Dick Holbrooke had with him Nick Platt who was the country
                    director, the fellow who I had replaced and who had in turn replaced Bill
                    Sherman as Country Director, and Dick said, “Come on Nick, you can join in.” So,
                    Nick did and they marched in numbering 13 instead of 12, past the outstretched
                    white-gloved hands of the imperial household staff. The Imperial Household
                    Agency was outraged, and within two hours of the departure of Carter, Bill
                    Sherman was called over to the palace. I went with him and we were reprimanded
                    by the Imperial Household Agency's chief of protocol for this incredible breach
                    of custom. We thought our people should have known better. Dick Holbrooke should
                    have known better and Nick Platt, the country director, should certainly have
                    known better. Anyway, the world didn't come to an end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The point is having a presidential visit in Japan, which
                        is a major ally, and when you're dealing with the emperor whose status is so
                        incredible. I mean Japanese language alone, you can't even talk to the
                        gentleman, the vocabulary requirements are so extensive, so I mean this
                        isn't just a visit down the street or to Ottawa. It has layers upon layers
                        of protocol and meaning and you survived.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. I left Japan in the summer of 1980 and I was by then assigned
                    to the Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) in London, which began in January
                    of 1981. So, I had nothing to do for the remainder of 1980. I was technically,
                    by then, assigned to the European bureau because of where the RCDS is located. I
                    was assigned by the European bureau to be their man at USUN for the General
                    Assembly session of 1980, because that way they could fulfill their obligation
                    to USUN without really having to dig into their own people. It was very handy
                    for the bureau.</p>
                <p>I spent September through December in New York and enjoyed it very much. I had
                    very little work to do. There was not much of consequence that involved Europe
                    as far as I could tell. All the action was Middle Eastern, relating to the
                    Iran-Iraq War, which had just broken out. We were tilting toward Iraq. April
                    Glaspie was the USUN Mid-East expert and I was impressed with her. She really
                    seemed to know what she was talking about. Dirk Gleysteen, Bill's brother, was
                    the political counselor.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>As I mentioned to you, another interesting part of those three months was living
                    at the Dakota, which I did. I lucked into a sublease well within my housing
                    allowance. I was there the night John Lennon was shot and that was a strange and
                    other-worldly kind of experience. I didn't witness the shooting, but I lived
                    with the rather surreal aftermath for a number of days. I enjoyed living in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the thing to note here is that when the UN General
                        Assembly meets in the fall, there's a surge, the Department adds more
                        officers to the USUN, because all the speakerthe prime and foreign
                        ministermake speeches and meet with the Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. Yes, there are going to be a lot of bilaterals. There's an
                    annual infusion of world leaders into New York and it takes more than the USUN
                    Mission itself to handle that. They need help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a considerable dance in scheduling the Secretary of
                        State. He's to meet with this minister and that minister. That's why there's
                        this surge, so that you just lucked into an annual process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right and it's one that is good experience. I was much more
                    deeply involved, though, later on as a DAS. I think if in your normal course of
                    Foreign Service assignments, you don't have any exposure to the UN or
                    multilateral diplomacy, a General Assembly session in New York wouldn't hurt you
                    at all. I would recommend it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The senior training that you're talking about the Royal
                        College of Defence Studies, would that be the same thing as going to the
                        Army War College at Carlisle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, basically it is. It is something that comes up and it was an
                    option that I had and it's the one that I wanted. I had a Stanford possibility
                    also, but I really liked the idea of going to London and I liked the idea of the
                    RCDS. Again, this is one of those things that Bill Sherman advised me on; he
                    thought the RCDS would be great fun and he was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he gone through it himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He had not, but he knew people who had. I don't know whether it is
                    still part of the menu for senior training in the State Department. I think it's
                    a rather expensive year for the Department. I'm not sure what the tuition fee
                    is, but there is one for Americans and for anybody from a developed country.
                    Then the living expenses are not inconsiderable in London. Anyway, it was a
                    wonderful year. The RCDS was formerly called the Imperial Defence College, until
                    that became politically incorrect. It's been around a long time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that where John Keegan teaches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, they don't have a teaching staff. They have a small
                    administrative staff and that's all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Every year they have 76 students, because that's the number of chairs
                    that comfortably fit in the lecture hall. It's an old mansion in Belgravia.
                    Belgrave Square in fact. We would be expected to be there by around 10:00 in the
                    morning, but that would be only for coffee or tea and it was kind of like a
                    gentlemen's club with big overstuffed chairs and racks of newspapers. That's the
                    way the day began. I think maybe around 10:30 or so there would be a lecture,
                    until noon. Sometimes a lecture in the afternoon, sometimes small group meetings
                    of one kind or another in the afternoon, sometimes nothing in the afternoon. It
                    was not a back-breaking schedule, but the people were great.</p>
                <p>The Australians had two or three very good people there who I got to know well,
                    and that was useful for me later on. The British had many outstanding people.
                    The composition of the class was roughly two-thirds British and one-third the
                    rest of the world and I would say two-thirds military and about one-third
                    civilian.</p>
                <p>Ranks were a little bit higher than at war colleges in the United States. There
                    were a lot of brigadiers and even some two star generals from foreign places. A
                    number of people who succeeded brilliantly in their respective services in years
                    to come. So, I enjoyed it very much. I'm very comfortable around the military. I
                    always have been. The quality of the lecturers was almost without exception
                    quite high. One of the best was General Bernard Rogers, NATO Commander and
                    fellow Fairview man.</p>
                <p>There was a great travel program. We broke up into small groups for orientation
                    visits around the UK early in the spring. I went with a group of about ten
                    people to Wales. Then in July the college closed down for a month. Sacie and I
                    did bicycle trips in Ireland and France. In the fall we had a large group trip
                    to NATO and to the British Army on the Rhine and then again a small group trip,
                    in my case to the Middle East where I'd never been before and knew I probably
                    would never go again. That's the one I wanted and got. We met Anwar Sadat, a
                    couple of weeks before he was killea highly charismatic man.</p>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I thought it was all quite relevant to a Foreign Service Officer
                    who was going to have a few more years of service. It broadened my perspective.
                    I'd been working primarily, almost exclusively, on East Asian issues since
                    joining the Foreign Service, and it was interesting and refreshing to be in a
                    European venue and to hear a lot about NATO, and U.S.-NATO issues. I liked that
                    very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished RCDS by writing a memorable paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, not memorable, but I was quite proud of it. It was done with no
                    footnotes and very little research but it read well and it was chosen for
                    publication in the annual journal of the college, along with about eight or nine
                    others. A triumph of sorts. “Sustaining the Alliance: The Future of
                    Transatlantic Political Cooperation.” Good bed-time reading.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you had arranged this year of sort of decompression
                        and exposure to new issues in advance. How did the opportunity to come back
                        to Washington arise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I obviously began thinking about that not long after arriving in
                    London. It was fairly early in the year that Mike Armacost called me and asked
                    me if I would be interested in being the Korea Country Director. Mike was DAS at
                    that time, with Japan and Korea and some other things in his portfolio, and he
                    was the senior DAS. Mike was there under Dick Holbrooke, and this was now the
                    Reagan administration. Holbrooke had left and Mike I guess was still there,
                    although he didn't remain there very long. I said that I'd be delighted. So I
                    knew fairly early on in the calendar year of 1981 that I'd be going to
                    EAP/K.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact when you finish up in London, you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: So, when I finished in London I went back to Washington by way of
                    Seoul. I met Dixie Walker, the ambassador. I think it was Dixie who really
                    wanted me to do thato meet him before I started in at EAP/K. Paul Cleveland was
                    the Deputy Chief of Mission there. Do you know Dixie?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not very well, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He was basically a China specialist, not an uncontroversial one. A
                    good man and a pretty good ambassador. He had his foibles, but basically he did
                    a good job for the United States. Anyway, I stopped and met him, stayed at the
                    residence, and then came on home to Washington by way of Kansas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, Dixie Walker was there when you went through,
                        oh, he would be there the entire time that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The entire time that I was on the desk. Yes. He stayed five years in
                    Korea, managed to stretch it out a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying, he was a unique personality. Some people
                        said that there were areas where he was quite...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, he had his blind spots. But he knew Korea well and he had good
                    insights into Asian culture in general. One kind of funny thing I remember,
                    shortly after I'd joined EAP/K, I went out to Seoul as country director for one
                    of those security consultative meetings, the big annual...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The SCM...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, the big annual get togethers that we had that alternated between
                    Seoul and Washington. I went out on the airplane with the Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, General David Jones. I remember he actually piloted the plane on takeoff
                    from Andrews with his staff kind of keeping their fingers crossed hoping he
                    still knew how to do it.</p>
                <p>In any event we got to Korea. Weinberger was there and Rich Armitage was with
                    Weinberger. The first thing on the agenda was a briefing at the residence by
                    Dixie Walker. We went there and sat in his living room and Dixie and his staff
                    briefed us, but basically it was Dixie who did the talking, and he went into
                    much more detail than anybody needed to have. Weinberger was falling asleep in
                    his chair. Anyway, it eventually ended and later Rich Armitage kind of zinged me
                    for letting my ambassador go on so long. I was in the position of defending one
                    political appointee to another political appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is March of 1982 with Weinberger; you were saying
                        that General Powell was also on that trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, that was a different trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, was it? Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: In the fall of '83 there were three events that dominated my working
                    life. The first was the shoot-down of KAL-007, which was a traumatic thing for
                    Korea, with a Korean airliner shot out of the sky. For the Korea desk it meant a
                    lot of additional work. Primarily it was the Soviet desk that was dealing with
                    our reaction to it, dealing with Moscow on the issue. But there was much more to
                    do - everything from organizing a memorial service at the National Cathedral to
                    unending meetings, keeping the Koreans informed, writing papers. Then about the
                    time we got all that cleaned up I was down in North Carolina on a much needed
                    vacation and Spence Richardson, my deputy, called me around midnight and said,
                    “There has been a bombing in Rangoon and half the South Korean cabinet has been
                    killed.” I went back up to Washington. That was indeed what happened, a North
                    Korean plot designed to kill Chun Doo Hwan. The bomb missed him, but it killed
                    six or eight really good people including the wonderful foreign minister and a
                    young economic advisor named Kim Jae Ik who would have been hugely important in
                    Korea if he'd lived.</p>
                <p>Weinberger was our representative at the funeral for those people and that's when
                    I went to Korea on Weinberger's airplane. Colin Powell was on board,
                    Weinberger's military assistant, and we made the round trip in 56 hours. If
                    Dixie briefed us, I think he was wise enough not to stretch it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or there would have been a 58th hour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. That was when I first met Colin Powell. As I mentioned to you
                    I was struck by the traveling style of Weinberger versus George Schultz. I had
                    been on George Schultz's airplane by then at least once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under what circumstance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Going from Seoul to Beijing earlier in '83. I went because there was
                    a possibility of a Korea subject being raised with the Chinese. I got to stay at
                    the Diaoyutai guesthouse and do one of those Great Hall of the People banquets.
                    Shultz's airplane was incredibly crowded. I contrasted that with this later trip
                    with Weinberger. It was basically a 707 cargo plane with one of those pods put
                    in it. There were very few people aboard. It was very bare bones - and I was
                    favorably impressed. Why can't everybody travel like that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without a large entourage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that Powell even handed out sleeping

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. That was one of his jobs. He also cued up the tape recorder to
                    play Willie Nelson's On the Road Again when we took off.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: A major issue in a sense all through that period, even though
                    sometimes it was obscured by other more immediate problems, was the political
                    situation in South Korea and the U.S. position vis-�-vis that situation. In
                    other words, the nature of Chun Doo Hwan's military regime, human rights
                    questions, democratization and to what extent could and should the United States
                    pressure the Korean government to do better. That was always an issue on our
                    bilateral agenda with the Koreans whenever we had high level visitors going
                    there. It was always something of an issue for the desk and we would have
                    congressional critics and others around town focusing on that issue. We had to
                    respond to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In one sense wasn't that issue highlighted by the Kwangju
                        circumstance, that had happened in 1980 and prior to this and that became
                        the poster child for these issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That was certainly a key event in modern Korean history and in
                    U.S.-Korea relations. Human rights issues loomed large. Shortly after I took
                    over the desk, Kim Dae Jung came to the United States for a period of exile,
                    having been let out of jail just a few weeks or months previously. Probably
                    having been saved from execution by a promise to invite Chun Doo Hwan to visit
                    the United States early in the new Reagan Administration - do not kill Kim Dae
                    Jung. This I understand was the bargain that Dick Holbrooke and Mike Armacost
                    had worked out.</p>
                <p>In any event Kim Dae Jung came to the United States and spent a good deal of
                    time, mostly in Boston. When he came to Washington I had breakfast with him and
                    I am quite sure that I was the only State Department official to see him. That
                    was wrong, a mistake; my mistake. He should have been received at a much higher
                    level because he was an important man. If you know Kim Dae Jung's history, we
                    perhaps saved his life in 1980, and certainly did so a number of years earlier
                    when Phil Habib was the ambassador and Don Gregg was the station chief. Kim Dae
                    Jung had been abducted from a Tokyo hotel and was aboard a Korean fishing boat
                    about to be tossed overboard when we intervened. Those issues were ever present
                    I would say.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>At the end of 1983 there was a Reagan visit to Seoul, which some human rights
                    advocates in the United States said was inappropriate, but I thought it was very
                    good. It was good in the context of the rough autumn they had had, with KAL-007
                    followed by the assassinations and bombing in Rangoon. The Reagan visit helped
                    to end the year on a positive note. I wasn't as involved in the planning for
                    that visit because I was in Washington. Paul Cleveland, the DCM, was of course
                    deeply involved. I went out a couple of days before the visit, and I was quite
                    impressed with the way that advance team worked and the rather smooth way in
                    which it all went. The desk had a role in the visit, of courslots of papers were
                    producebut the embassy was much more deeply engaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That trip probably wasn't just to Korea. It probably
                        included...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It had been a Japan-Korea trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Looking at a presidential visit from the Washington
                        side is different from the receiving side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It's much more relaxing as I recall. Much easier. I was there for it,
                    but mostly as a spectator. I remember sitting in on the last meeting of the
                    advance team as they went through their final checks. I remember the advance man
                    saying to his people that the next day President Reagan would be in a motorcade
                    before the largest crowd of his Presidency, which I guess it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time there wasn't any more movement on withdrawing
                        troops from Korea? It had all blown over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No. That's right. Talk of withdrawing troops had died away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the political evolution side, here you have this
                        authoritarian structure. Were there any besides Kim, were there any other
                        allies internal to the Korean system that were voicing more modernistic
                        approaches? I mean its one thing, it seems to me, to tell an authoritarian
                        regime it can't keep shooting people and another thing to actually talk
                        about the political maturation process where other actors are beginning to
                        develop.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That was certainly beginning to happen in South Korea. There were
                    other actors, including very seasoned politicians, not just Kim Dae Jung who was
                    still in the United States, but Kim Young Sam, and there were degrees of
                    modernity among the military. Not everybody was a cave dweller, politically. I
                    think Noh Tae Woo himself is a good example. He succeeded Chun Doo Hwan as
                    president, but he was a very different kind of general. He really was the first
                    in the democratic, so to speak, line of succession. There were differences
                    within the ruling elite. Some who were more liberal than others. Chun Doo Hwan
                    himself in the end made the right decision. He essentially agreed to allow a
                    peaceful transition at the end of his term instead of sending troops out to
                    confront the demonstrators. That happened a couple of months after I left Korea
                    in 1987. At that time, in 1983, there were still a few more years of Chun Doo
                    Hwan ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. As you were saying there was a kind of a long-term
                        thing that would pop up from time to time. One of the issues that would pop
                        up fairly importantly was the rice issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, indeed. I still think it was the single hardest problem I ever
                    dealt with in the Foreign Servicmaybe because it was as much a domestic issue as
                    a foreign policy issue. In a nutshell, in 1980 the South Koreans had a rice
                    shortage. They had to buy rice somewhere. The United States didn't have a
                    surplus that year, oddly enough, so we agreed that they, the Koreans could buy
                    the rice they needed from Japan. Ordinarily Japanese rice, by agreement, was
                    kept off the international market because it is so lavishly subsidized. We
                    allowed that sale on the condition that the Koreans would agree to buy 500,000
                    tons of the 1981 crop of California rice, which is their preferred variety.</p>
                <p>They agreed to that condition and by so agreeing were committed. That commitment
                    having been made, a particular rice broker, Grover Connell of New Jersey, who
                    had long represented the major California rice co-ops, basically got their
                    agreement that he would be the broker and he would sell the rice for them. The
                    Koreans, however, refused to deal with him because they had dealt with him in
                    the past and disliked him intensely. You know, Korean rice issues go way back.
                    If you remember Tong Sun Park, or people like Otto Passman. It's a rich and
                    colorful history. In any event the Koreans said no, we're not going to deal with
                    Grover Connell. Grover Connell, however, had control of the rice, so there was
                    an impasse. The congressional rice lobby was unleashed and that's when the heat
                    began to build on EAP/K and myself. There were calls from congressmen. There
                    were letters to the president, letters to the Secretary of State about these
                    nefarious Koreans who were refusing to follow through on a commitment that they
                    had made. There were other, more insidious pressures including a visit to my
                    office that I didn't know about until after the fact by a prominent West Coast
                    politician and big man in the rice lobby, who basically threatened the career of
                    one of my officers. We were perceived as supporting the Koreans. We, the State
                    Department, and I think the East Asia bureau in particular. This had all
                    happened with very little reference to the 7th floor, and for a long time, for
                    months, the highest-ranking guy in the Department dealing with it was Tony
                    Albrecht. Did you ever know Tony Albrecht?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: A wonderful fellow and fine officer. He was the DAS for economic
                    affairs. I think his career was more European-focused for the most part, but he
                    was in this job in EAP. He was tough and principled, and he was completely
                    unafraid of anything. Basically we just kind of kept shielding ourselves as
                    slings and arrows from the Hill headed our way. We did attempt to convince the
                    Koreans to go ahead and go through with the purchase but they were absolutely
                    adamant. They were not going to deal with Grover Connell. They were being
                    stubborn, as Koreans can be.</p>
                <p>Ken Dam eventually got involved. He was the Deputy Secretary of State at that
                    time. I came to wish he hadn't because he seemed to me to be overly responsive
                    to congressional pressure and basically tended to transmit that pressure to the
                    Korean government, which I believed to be unproductive and maybe
                    counterproductive. But then he got back out of the issue.</p>
                <p>Paul Wolfowitz was the Assistant Secretary at the time and he had not been
                    involved and we got him involved finally. I think the precipitating event was a
                    hearing called by the rice lobby, by Congressman Bill Alexander of Arkansas, and
                    Paul was going to testify for the bureau along with the Undersecretary of
                    Agriculture, Dick Lina very savvy guy. We all went up there to the committee
                    room and they made their prepared statements and when all that was done, klieg
                    lights came on and Bill Alexander announced that he would now “swear” the
                    witnesses, and there would be sworn testimony from then on and it would be
                    televised. It was going to be a kind of congressional shooting gallery.
                    Wolfowitz and the Undersecretary basically stood up at that point and said, no,
                    we're not going to do that, those weren't the ground rules. We were prepared for
                    a hearing, not an investigation, and we went home. I liked Wolfowitz's
                    performance that day. He was tough and knew what he was doing. The Agriculture
                    man also was very good.</p>
                <p>In any event we were at this impasse and there was very intense congressional
                    pressure, which was the reason it was a very hard problem for me as a desk
                    director. We were saved by nature, because the issue went on so long that the
                    1982 crop was harvested and began to pour into the bins of California. You can't
                    tell 1981 rice from 1982 rice when it's in the bin. In that sense it's a
                    fungible commodity like water or milk, it flows together. And about that time
                    the co-ops themselves realized they'd been shooting themselves in the foot for
                    Grover Connell of New Jersey for a year. The co-ops broke free of Grover
                    Connell, the Koreans readily bought 500,000 tons of unidentified vintage rice
                    and the problem went away.</p>
                <p>This experience was very interesting because it was an illustration to me of the
                    way those kinds of lobbies could work. The rice lobby has always been one of the
                    more tightly knit and effective ones on the Hill, I think, and it includes
                    members from California as well as from the South.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an interesting demonstration of the interaction of
                        the role congress plays in these games. Here you were in Tokyo and you had
                        to deal with the Japanese response to Korean issues. Here you're on the desk
                        and you're as much concerned with the congress as the Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four. You were talking about
                        political-military issues in Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall any particularly outstanding ones during the years
                    1982 to 1984 quite frankly. It was always an active part of the desk's
                    portfolio, but I don't think we had any major crises. We had a defection across
                    the demilitarized zone, I remember that. A young army private from St. Louis
                    decided to try life in the People's Paradise. That was a strange happening. We
                    had regular military exercisehuge in scale. The North Koreans of course
                    regularly protested. There were always real estate issues of one kind or another
                    to talk about with the Koreans, but I think nothing of great consequence because
                    the troop withdrawal issue had pretty much been put to bed and would not come up
                    again for a number of more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I have on the list here that I've
                        come up with is fishery issues..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Something about tuna fishing. The San Diego fleet?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I do recall a conflict there, but I don't remember the details.
                    That, too is an industry group that can muster a good deal of clout. I think
                    John Negroponte by then was Assistant Secretary for Fisheries, or Oceanic
                    Affairs, and he had done a good deal of negotiating on those issues. I remember
                    him somehow being involved in a Korea-related problem, but I can't think of the
                    details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's illustrative of the fact that you never can tell
                        what's going to come up bilaterally and that you have to make some
                        adjustment to it. I mean you often find people who don't see foreign
                        relations as managing small things so they don't become big things. That's
                        why I had it on my list. For example, one other thing that was major at that
                        time on the commercial side, was Control Data. It was having some problems
                        in Korea at that time. The company got kicked out or their license was
                        suspended or something and the desk got involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I also remember there were labor issues. Korean labor was very much
                    constrained in those years, but nevertheless labor issues would arise and
                    occasionally they involved an American company. It seems to me there were
                    instances where American plant managers were briefly held hostage, for example.
                    Control Data may have been one of those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we talk about who was on the desk with you at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: My deputy when I started out was Bill Breer who I worked with in
                    Japan, and then he moved on and was replaced by Spence Richardson, who I had
                    known since Saigon. The first economic officer was Bob Richmond and he was
                    succeeded by John Hoog. There was a North Korea watcher - now it's a whole
                    section of that desk. I believe just about the whole time I was there Barbara
                    Harvey had that job, a very good officer. We had a junior officer. At least part
                    of the time it was David Straub, who is the country director now and I think the
                    best Korean speaker in the Foreign Service. (Spence Richardson and John Hoog are
                    now my colleagues in KEDO, in North Korea.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your view of the world of course is Korea centric, but
                        during this time a lot was being done on China issues. Did any of that
                        impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall them impacting upon me, but I remember thinking that
                    Bill Rope was doing a hell of a good job on the China desk under a lot of
                    pressure from a lot of different quarters. This was what, the time of the second
                    Shanghai communiqu�?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, '82 August yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and it seemed very complicated and very intense and it just
                    seemed to me that that desk was performing very well. As I know it had under
                    Chas Freeman. When was Chas the country director?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was there '79 to '81.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. Didn't Chas initiate the practice of official-informal weekly
                    summaries?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wouldn't be surprised.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Then all desks started doing them. Something out to the embassy each
                    week just to give a status report on where various issues stood, and that was a
                    new innovation. In any event, I admired Rope and I always thought he should have
                    been better rewarded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on the Korea desk in March of '84 you did
                        some consultation travel to Sydney and Canberra on the ANZUS Talks.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. I knew that I would be going out that summer to be the DCM in
                    Australia, so this was an opportunity to see New Zealand and Australia for the
                    first time and see Canberra and see what I'd gotten myself into. It was a good
                    trip. I think those were perhaps the last of the ANZUS Talks because New Zealand
                    and the Labor Government were already having problems with our port calls, our
                    “neither confirm nor deny” policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew you were going to go there as DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one get chosen DCM? I mean this is a senior
                        position in the Foreign Service. Country director is an incredible
                        accomplishment, but DCM is a very important position in the whole
                        system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: As I recall Steve Lyne, the incumbent DCM suggested the idea to me at
                    some point, maybe late '83 or very early '84. Steve had been in the political
                    section with me in Saigon. He was our man among the Montagnards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Saigon mafia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. I guess it was kind of a Saigon mafia connection. He said it was
                    an interesting place to live and work and I ought to give it a try. He
                    recommended me to the Ambassador, Bob Nesen. I guess I had no other immediate
                    alternatives. I was fairly sure, however, when I went off to Australia that when
                    Paul Cleveland left Seoul, Dixie was probably going to want me to come to Seoul.
                    I went to Australia knowing or at least assuming that it probably wasn't going
                    to last all that long. It turned out to be a highly interesting and enjoyable
                    experience. We do have a special relationship with the Australians. They are
                    good political and security partners, and we have an uninhibited intelligence
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>I remember at one point when I was there Bob Gates, who was then DDI, came out to
                    Australia to talk with the Australians about his take on the world basically.
                    This would have been probably sometime in '84. Gorbachev was new on the scene
                    and Gates told the Australians that he felt Gorbachev was fundamentally
                    different from his predecessors and that there were going to be remarkable
                    changes in the Soviet Union as a result. I was very impressed at the time, and
                    even more so later, as those things indeed happened.</p>
                <p>We didn't have any serious bilateral issues with our Australian friends, but
                    there were often political controversies occasioned by our presence. There's a
                    left-wing in Australia that's noisy if not necessarily powerful. They're
                    certainly well represented in the media, so there is a lot of press criticism of
                    the U.S. There's a certain strain of anti-Americanism on the left. There was
                    always a little bit of tension, stuff that would get my blood going
                    occasionally.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>We had this remarkable technological phenomenon out there at Pine Gap that was
                    important to us and extremely sensitive, and the Australians were very good
                    about helping us with it and maintaining and providing political defense for it
                    if we needed it. The Hawke government was rock solid. Bob Hawke himself was an
                    appealing personality. I got to see him from time to time accompanying
                    visitors.</p>
                <p>The best part about that tour is that I was there 18 months and I was the Charg�
                    for fully 12 months. Bob Nesen, the incumbent ambassador, was a political
                    appointee. I got there in August of '84, and he left in the first half of '85.
                    Then Bill Lane, another political appointee, arrived I believe in early '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've got that he presented his credentials on the
                        29th of April '89.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That'd be too long. '86, that's '86. So, it would be May
                        of '85 to April of '86 basically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: And Nesen was often gone during the few months remaining in his
                    tenure. He was involved with the '84 campaign. Nesen was a major contributor,
                    and he loved horses and loved the Aussies. He was an extremely nice man,
                    although he wasn't too much interested in the details of running an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under those conditions a lot falls to you, the DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes and I enjoyed that very much. Then Bill Lane was his successor
                    and I...you say April of...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Must have been March, or maybe even February. I left just days after
                    that. Sacie and I went with him and his wife for his presentation of credentials
                    to the Governor General in Sydney, at the summer residence under the Harbor
                    Bridge. It was pretty clear that Bill Lane was a very different kind of
                    political appointee ambassador, one who intended to be fully in charge of every
                    detail. I handed off to my successor Dick Teare, my old Vietnamese language
                    partner. So, we had three political section Saigon guys in a row. Steve Lyne,
                    myself and Dick Teare as DCMs in Canberra.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Into the DCMship business, my recollection is actually the
                        State Department runs you through a course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right, there was a DCM course.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long is that? What does it cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was several days at some offsite location in West Virginia or
                    Pennsylvania. I don't remember much about the content. There was a certain
                    emphasis on the public affairs aspects of an embassy and the DCM's potential
                    responsibility in that area and some discussion of broader management and
                    dealing with your ambassador, those kinds of things. In fact I'd totally
                    forgotten about the course until you mentioned it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to a lot of people out of it at FSI and they were
                        saying that that course was cranked up because the Department was finding
                        something like 70% of the DCMs were being fired by the career and non-career
                        ambassadors because they weren't getting along. The issue was you need to
                        run your DCMs through some course of awareness training as to how to get
                        along and how to handle yourself in these circumstances. I don't know when
                        the course started, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I once heard Marshall Green say that a good DCM is one who walks
                    around with a smile on his ambassador's face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Marshall. Wasn't he ambassador in Australia at one
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He had been, yes, he was there in fact when I was in EA/RA. I have a
                    nice letter from him in response to a paper I wrote on Soviet policy in East
                    Asia, and Marshall Green very kindly responded. He said he thought it was
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I remember reading something by him that I'd like
                        you to comment on. He was there at the time that the Labor Party came to
                        power for the first time in 12 years or something like that. This was the
                        Vietnam War period. Labor had been critical and he suddenly, this was an
                        unanticipated victory on Labor's part, and he sort of realized that they
                        hadn't been talking to Labor Party officials for a long time. He gets into
                        the defense attach�'s airplane and is flying around Australia trying to get
                        to the Labor Party guys to get them to not say anything silly about Vietnam
                        in the euphoria of their victory. Which brings another point, academics and
                        pundits now talk about how great it is to have democracies around the world
                        and it strikes me that the Foreign Service's job is complicated by the fact
                        that there are democracies. I mean you're saying okay, there's an
                        anti-American component to Australia, but you can't laugh that off, you have
                        to deal with it. You have the public affairs officers there. You have to
                        have somebody in the political section touching bases with those people so
                        that you understand their viewpoints. Because the domestic politics of
                        democracies have a new importance increasing the job of the Foreign Service,
                        America's first line of defense overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Think how much more complicated in a way it is to conduct bilateral
                    relations with South Korea today, now that it is a democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There you go.As you were saying here, you know, you're
                        actually moving from the authoritarian Korea to the Aussie situation and we
                        do have these facilities. We have this incredible military relationship. In
                        fact it's incredibly deep. All the Anglo-Saxon nations have a special
                        relationship and share things among themselves that they don't share with
                        anybody else and yet you have the democracy aspect spinning in there and
                        it's not easy even though they are our allies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes and in some respects it's more complicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would suspect even at that, this is not an easy as
                        falling off a log thing to go through because you have to be very much aware
                        of what the Australians are doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, it was not by any means a simple place to do business. It is, in
                    its way, very complex, and therefore far more interesting than you might think.
                    It's not dull being in Australia. Of course it's also a marvelous place to
                    live.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Anyway, back to Marshall Green. I remember when Paul Cleveland was
                    leaving the bureau to go to Seoul as political counselor shortly after I got
                    back to the bureau in 1973, Marshall Green was the Assistant Secretary and Phil
                    Habib was about to replace him. Green was presiding in the conference room over
                    a party for Paul Cleveland and, you've probably heard both of these, but he had
                    two offerings that day. One was “these are the times that try Seoul's men”,
                    followed by “let he who is without sin castigate the first ROK.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is so typical of Green. I remember I did a book
                        review for the Foreign Service Journal on something Marshall had written and
                        Ed Peck wrote a letter complaining that I didn't catch the full essence of
                        Marshall's humor. Who else was down in Australia with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had a great Embassy team, and made some good friendships. Dick
                    Baker was the political counselor, Bob Lavey the special assistant, Jim Waggoner
                    the Defense Attach�. Wes Stuart was the PAO. Duke Ryan was the CAO. It was a
                    wonderful group of people. Australia's such a marvelous place for people who
                    like outdoor activity as we do. We did a lot of camping and got ourselves a
                    Toyota Land Cruiser, drove deep into the outback, and spent a lot of weekends on
                    beaches, deserted beaches - just a wonderful place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some argue Australians do so well in swimming in the last
                        Olympics because they're trying to outrace the sharks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It's interesting. They've really had kind of a renaissance. Sport is
                    important to Australians, always has been, but they've clearly succeeded
                    marvelously in developing world class athletes in the last 20 years. They
                    weren't as impressive when I was there. One of the nice things that happened -
                    I'm a sports fan - when I was there was the World Cup Track championship, which
                    is held midway between Olympics and it was held in Canberra and I was Charg�. I
                    invited the American team to a reception at the ambassador's residence. Craig
                    Masback, who is the head of the U.S. Track and Field Federation today, was a
                    young miler. He told me it was the first time - and he had been doing
                    international competition for a number of years - it was the first time he'd
                    ever been invited to a reception at an ambassador's residence. I invited coaches
                    from other teams. The Soviet coach was for years the world record holder in the
                    long jump until Bob Beaman broke it in Mexico City in 1968. I loved that.</p>
                <p>It was a team competition. The United States versus the Soviet Union versus East
                    Germany. Those were the three distinct national teams, versus the rest of
                    Europe, the rest of the Americas, and Asia. Scoring was on that basis. It came
                    down to a final event, the 1600 meter relay and we won and by winning we won the
                    team competition over the Soviets. I was sitting next to the Soviet ambassador
                    and the East German. It was a great experience. I met John Landy that day, who
                    was the second sub four-minute miler in the world in 1954. I've been a track and
                    field buff all my life and I was in track fans' heaven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That raises an interesting point though, how some of the
                        social functions unfold in these countries. In Australia would you entertain
                        at home or entertain at restaurants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I did one-on-one lunches a fair amount in restaurants, but we
                    entertained a lot at home too. We had a house that was the smallest
                    representational house you can imagina nice bungalow and a very attractive one
                    that Sacie made even more attractive. We could have dinner for a dozen people
                    without too much crowding. That was about the limit. We did quite a lot of
                    entertaining at the house, as we did in Japan.</p>
                <p>In Japan more often than not it was lunches. But we did stuff at our house in
                    Tokyo frequently, thanks to Sacie's organizational abilities and the help of a
                    Thai maid. I think that's less common now in the Foreign Service, isn't that
                    right? I've heard that. There's less at-home entertaining - and therefore less
                    necessity for representational housing in some places and in some positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe a cart and a horse thing because I know in Bangkok
                        when we were first there in the '70s, there were such huge separate houses
                        and now they package everybody in apartments.</hi>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Life has changed and I've found, at least when I was in Bangkok, and
                    I think in Seoul also, there wasn't much “at home” entertainment done of a
                    representational nature. At least not below the counselor level.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, I'm trying to think, we surely would have had one in the year and

                        on the radar of the Australians because if they get lucky the American

                        meetings and its supposed to alternate between each capital.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Then it might have been in Washington. Shultz came out, but it wasn't
                    for an AusMin visit, it was purely SECSTATE.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He wanted to go to Perth and I recommended against Perth because
                    Perth in July is the worst place in Australia. It's cold and rainy. But he had
                    been stationed there in World War II and by gosh he wanted to see it again. And
                    it was cold and rainy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, as a Marine. I believe he met his wife in the Philippines. She
                    was a nurse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned earlier that you thought if Paul left

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. I don't recall exactly when that was finalized, but it
                    was sometime during 1985. Paul was named ambassador to New Zealand, and
                    incidentally he was notified of that in a very nice way that I don't think is
                    done anymore. He got a phone call from the president. He was out on the Yongsan
                    Golf Course for an early morning golf game with the USFK general and a couple of
                    retired Korean generals and somebody came out from the club house and said he
                    had a telephone call. He went in and took it and came back out and told his
                    fellow players that that had been the president. That was Reagan. I think maybe
                    the practice ended with Reagan. Maybe it only took place during the Reagan
                    administration - a very nice personal gesture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the start of the second Reagan

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, or at least early-on. So, in 1986, March, or possibly earlier,
                    maybe February, Bill Lane presented his credentials and I left just after
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Direct transfer to Seoul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a direct transfer mean? You've got a household,
                        a family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, it really was quite direct for me. Sacie came back to the
                    United States and spent a little time here. No, we both came back to the United
                    States, but it was very brief for me. A little bit longer stay for her. Our
                    shipment got there in a timely fashion. It wasn't long before we were
                    reestablished in that nice old Japanese house that has now been torn down, which
                    was the DCM residence. As usual, Sacie did great things with it.</p>
                <p>That compound is one we hope is going to be the site of a new American Embassy, a
                    deal that we thought we had finalized when I was the DCM there and it is still
                    controversial, and unconsummated. In any event it was a nice house and that too
                    was a good tour. It was so brief - blindingly short. But it was interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dixie Walker's still there. He was there for a few
                        more months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, Dixie Walker was there. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we keep coming back to the point that here you're
                        sitting in one country, but something that happened someplace else
                        reverberates. At the time that you're in Seoul, DCM, Marcos falls in the
                        Philippines. Did that particularly reverberate, because there's still this
                        authoritarian system in place in Korea and it's going to be feeling...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think Marcos fell just before I went from Australia to Korea,
                    didn't he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually it's about the same month.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: About the same time. Yes, it was a source of great interest and hope
                    and fear, depending upon who you were in Korea, that that transition had taken
                    place, and I'm sure the American role in it was noted by Chun Doo Hwan and his
                    people. With every passing month Chun Doo Hwan was that much closer to the end
                    of his “legitimate” presidential term, so something dramatic was going to happen
                    in the summer of '87. Either he was going to step down as required or he was
                    not. I'm sure that the Marcos resignation had a considerable impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just before I came out here I was reading Secretary
                        Shultz's book and he made a trip out to Korea shortly after your arrival? He
                        says that at that time there were the largest anti-government riots going
                        on. I'm not quite sure of his time line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think he came in the spring of '87, shortly before I left. It was
                    '87 when things began to heat up and people began to anticipate a transition or
                    some sort of dramatic change; tensions began to rise in the spring of '87. I
                    believe that's when Shultz made his trip. There were demonstrations very often;
                    they customarily were at major intersections a few blocks from the embassy, and
                    near where I lived. The smell of tear gas was often in the air.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: By early '87 I believe Lilley had arrived.</p>

                        been there now for some time. He's very comfortable. He's met everybody
                        there is to meet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and I think the embassy was working pretty well. I don't recall
                    any huge management issues that had been neglected. Paul Cleveland had been a
                    good DCM and knew how to work with Dixie, and I kind of stepped into, in a
                    sense, a well grooved track, that is as the manager of the embassy. I don't ever
                    remember getting crosswise with Dixie or there really being a need for me to. It
                    seemed to me to be kind of an easy transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also slide behind Paul in his golf game?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, I don't play golf. In fact, well, that same group...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a bit of a handicap.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: ...that same group pressed me to join. It was called the Tuesday
                    morning golf group and it met on Thursdays, the year round, at 6:30 in the
                    morning. I finally told them that after the New Year I would join them. This
                    would have been January of '87. I went out there and the course was entirely
                    covered in a sheet of ice that was rutted in places because there had been snow
                    that had melted and refrozen. We played our round. You'd hit the golf ball and
                    it might hit a rut and bounce off hundreds of feet in the other direction
                    skittering on the ice. The ice was a real equalizer. No, I did not play golf. I
                    had a wonderful opportunity to learn when I was in Indonesia. There was a brand
                    new golf course that the generals had built in Medan. I think it cost a dollar
                    to play 18 holes. In the consulate our communicator was a young guy who was a
                    very good athlete and a one or two handicap golfer. He wanted to teach me, and I
                    had all the time in the world. Even under those circumstances, after one or two
                    attempts I gave it up. I found it very frustrating. How about you? Are you a
                    golfer?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I've had the same experience, a lot of guys say
                        “oh; you've got to take this up.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think there are places, Korea possibly is one, Bangkok certainly
                    would have been another, where it could have been quite useful to have played
                    golf. I'd have gotten to know Suchinda, for example, much better had I been a
                    golfer. But that would have been a huge sacrifice, so time consuming.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: In any event, Korea was a comfortable place to get back into. After
                    all, I'd left the desk only a little more than a year and a half earlier and so
                    I knew the issues pretty well. I knew the people in our embassy and in the
                    government. It didn't seem like new territory. It was a comfortable move.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I did, but again it wasn't very long into that tour when I was pretty
                    sure that Gaston (Sigur, Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Bureau)
                    was going to ask me to come back and be a DAS (Deputy Assistant Secretary). I
                    think by the summer of '86 I knew that in '87 I was probably going to be out of
                    there which, among other things, caused me to give up my futile efforts to learn
                    Korean in the early morning before the office opened. Korea was always going to
                    be a sort of transitional thing for us. I knew fairly early on that the tour was
                    not going to last very long.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, Kim Dae Jung by that time was back in Korea and out of jail, but

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Dixie was called in by the Prime Minister, Noh Sin Yong, who was a
                    former KCIA director, but a modern man and a sophisticated man. I went with
                    Dixie. Noh pleaded with him not to invite Kim Dae Jung to our National Day party
                    because it would be too grave an insult to Chun Doo Hwan and would spark
                    domestic unrest, etc. He made various arguments, with great passion. Dixie was
                    noncommittal but gave no indication that he was going to change his mind. It was
                    remarkable how much emotional ardor was wrapped up in that on the Korean side.
                    We did do it, of course, and Kim Dae Jung came to the party, was there briefly
                    and left, and life continued to go on in Korea. But I think the repercussions
                    were quite severe within the Korean government.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. It was really quite unpleasant and an interesting example of the
                    mindset of Chun Doo Hwan and to some extent of the intensity of Korean politics.
                    Koreans take things very seriously, whether it's something like that, or this
                    Olympic gymnastics dispute that just happened. I am sure there have been
                    demonstrators at the embassy over that as well.</p>

                        there was heated talk in the Op-Ed pages about flying a Confederate flag.
                        The American Civil War was 150 years ago and yet people get quite emotional
                        from time to time. But, if the Koreans fuss about something that was 100
                        years ago we'd say, “oh, get over it.”</hi>

                    because of the calendar and the required timing of the transition. I was with
                    Gaston by then, and at the first ASEAN meeting I attended, in Manila, when Chun
                    Doo Hwan was confronted with massive demonstrations and Sigur decided to go
                    there from Manila to talk to Chun and try to assert some constructive American
                    influence in the situation, and he did a good job of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's all being downgraded as part of the reorganization in Korea,

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Who was there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: General Livsey. Jack Livsey, a very brash, soldier's soldier type
                    guy, smart. Embassy-USFK liaison was effected in many ways. There was a POL/MIL
                    section that worked with its contacts. We had Intel people who connected with
                    J-2 out there, and no doubt there were various other kinds of connections. We
                    also had regular meetings between the ambassador and CINC, a weekly breakfast.
                    Then I also had a breakfast on a weekly basis with the deputy, who was a three
                    star air force general, and a mild mannered man who I could relate to more
                    easily than I could to Livsey. I don't recall any serious issues between the
                    embassy and USFK during that short tour of mine.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's interesting at an administrative level, you're
                        both making an effort to make sure that you're talking with each other, that
                        you have a regular time to meet so that you can march in lock-step because I
                        would assume if you were to get out of step with each other the impact on
                        what the Koreans would see would be pretty significant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, that's absolutely right and it still happens from time to time,
                    even recently. I recall within the last couple of years, the CINC made a speech
                    on the security situation, and it seemed to me that if he cleared it with
                    anybody it must only have been in Doug Feith's office. I think the
                    embassy-military relationship was pretty successful during the time that I was
                    there. There had been some colorful people through there as CINC over the years,
                    and a few of them had been a little hard to deal with. One of the best was
                    General Jack Vessey, later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was General Gary Luck there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, he was. When I was DCM he was commander of what I believe was
                    called the First Field Force, a combat arm up there in the Chorwon Valley north
                    of Seoul. He was a two star then. Later he was head of the Special Operations
                    Command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later I think, because I was at the Korea desk in the
                        Pentagon later, he was CINC. But as we were saying, the Seoul tour actually
                        gets kind of wedged in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it was wedged in between other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other things and that other thing is you're asked to come
                        back to the East Asia bureau as the deputy assistant secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. I met Gaston for the first time when I was country director for
                    Korea and he was the NSC East Asia man in the Reagan White House, so I knew him
                    a little bit. In any event, for one reason or another he decided he'd like to
                    have me in that job. I replaced John Monjo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: John went out to be ambassador to Malaysia. He later went to
                    Indonesia. I got back to Washington in March, I think in late March, and I
                    almost immediately turned around and headed back out for a visit to my new
                    area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What the reader has to understand is there are about three

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We were set up with four at the time. Stape Roy, whose portfolio was
                    China, Taiwan and Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. Bill Clark was
                    the senior DAS and had Japan, Korea and other things. Mine was Southeast Asia.
                    Then we had an economic deputy, Bill Piez. A total of four deputy assistant
                    secretaries. Those have been changed around. I think they've now combined
                    Southeast Asia and Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. When I was
                    there I just had Southeast Asia, the ten countries of Southeast Asia.</p>

                        does that mean that something coming up from the Cambodia desk or the Thai
                        desk goes through you before it hits Gaston? There's a signature block for
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. Yes, usually.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. There's a good deal of that; there's a lot of
                    territorial scope to the job and a fair amount of responsibility. I liked the
                    job very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your orientation tour of April of '87, you had Bangkok,
                        Jakarta and Manila as the key posts. How were things settling out? What did
                        you perceive as some of the problems you were going to have to pay attention
                        to? I keep forgetting to ask at the end what was the difference between when
                        you started and when you left, but I'll try and figure that out later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, in Korea the main difference is that we were a year closer to
                    some kind of political change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that and I haven't followed up properly. Chun Doo

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, he became president by some process in 1980 for a seven year
                    term.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He protested his legitimacy throughout his tenure and part of being
                    legitimate is stepping down when your term is up, so that was what was coming
                    up.</p>

                        deputy assistant secretary for Southeast Asia. You've hit these countries.
                        It's late Reagan administration, it's 1987, let's see Iran and Iraq is still
                        going on. Worldwide that's impacting on oil prices and stuff. Within East
                        Asia are there sort of general trends that you're concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, the most active set of problems was in Bangkok because of the
                    Cambodian War. That was clearly going to be a priority, that issue. Bill Brown
                    was still the ambassador there. Dan hadn't gotten there yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brown was shortly to leave. They gave him the Moscow

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, yes, that's right. Then he went to Israel.</p>
                <p>I don't recall any big pending issues in Jakarta. Paul Wolfowitz was by then
                    ambassador. It was interesting for me to be back in Indonesia for the first time
                    since I'd been stationed there. I tried out my Indonesian in a press encounter.
                    Paul was impressive, I thought, in his role as ambassador. He'd been studying
                    Indonesian and had made a good deal of progress. His wife was a specialist in
                    Javanese culture. She'd done an AFS stint there and then it continued as an
                    academic interest, and I believe she spoke and wrote Javanese. Paul knew the
                    people and had a very sophisticated take on all the issues. He was a good
                    ambassador. I remember I stayed in his residence in one of his guestrooms and it
                    was lined with shelves filled with books, and I looked at the books on those
                    shelves hoping to find some pulp novel that I could read myself to sleep with.
                    There was nothing of that nature. He is a brilliant and a very serious-minded
                    man. He was impressive as an ambassador - as he had been as assistant secretary
                    at a very young age. I remember being around Paul more than anything else about
                    that brief stopover in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>In the Philippines I talked to a lot of peopland the Filipinos are very easy to
                    talk with. Nick Platt was the Ambassador. He had a couple of active years ahead
                    of him, thanks to those various Filipino dissidents who tried to overthrow Cory
                    Aquino, repeatedly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were mentioning a minute ago that Cambodia and the

                        the future understand it as well, but there're a number of actors in the
                        Cambodian thing if you'd like to explain who was doing what to whom, and the
                        basic issue was the Vietnamese had invaded Cambodia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Khmer Rouge had taken over in 1975, when Saigon also fell, and
                    their relations with the Vietnamese became increasingly strained, to the point
                    that in 1978 Vietnam invaded Cambodia and drove the Khmer Rouge from power and
                    installed a government led by a former KR commander, the Hun Sen government -
                    and they occupied Cambodia with as many as 250,000 troops. It was a big force.
                    By 1987 there were still 200,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia and indeed in a
                    small sliver of Thai territory over near the Laotian-Cambodia border. So, when
                    that happened, in 1978, Thailand was alarmed. Other ASEAN countries were
                    alarmed. They quickly repaired their somewhat strained relations with the United
                    States, and we began cooperating with them and they with us in efforts both
                    diplomatic and military to get the Vietnamese out of Cambodia. That included a
                    UN resolution which allowed the Khmer Rouge to keep the UN seat. That happened
                    before the Reagan administration came into office. There was an annual
                    resolution that ASEAN skillfully put together that would always pass
                    overwhelmingly condemning the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. On the ground
                    in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand, there was a program of support for the
                    non-Khmer Rouge resistance groups. The Khmer Rouge were amply supported and
                    supplied by China. The Khmer Rouge operated out of a headquarters in Pailin,
                    near the Thai-Cambodia border. But quite apart from the KR, the United States,
                    working with its ASEAN friends, supported two separate non-communist resistance
                    factions, one of them a royalist group called FUNCINPEC—Unified Front for the
                    Liberation of Cambodia or something to that effect, and the other one being the
                    KPNLF which was a nationalist, non-communist, non-royalist group. The United
                    States supplied only non-lethal assistance to those two groups. They got their
                    weapons elsewhere - from China or other sources, but not from the United States.
                    Support for FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, which we called the non-communist
                    resistance or NCR for short, was carried out basically through intelligence
                    channels in Thailand. To sum up, there was an active program of support for the
                    non-communist resistance, and a continuing low intensity war against the
                    Vietnamese and the Cambodian government which the Vietnamese had established
                    inside Cambodia. That was pretty much the situation when I became DAS in
                    1987.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, how can one support the non-communist resistance without in
                    effect supporting the Khmer Rouge? We were fighting the Khmer Rouge's enemy.
                    That was a very good question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Diplomatically as you said in the UN the Khmer Rouge was
                        the guy who legally was the representative, so...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Was the representative, yes. It was not a very neat or clear cut
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get the Washington players in this problem
                        identified, because there's you trying to figure it out, congress's
                        pressuring, holding meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, there was a lot of congressional interest in Cambodia. I
                    remember it being particularly from the House side, and the leading player and a
                    driving force in Congress on foreign policy issues was Steve Solarz, who was the
                    chairman of the East Asia subcommittee of what was then called the House Foreign
                    Affairs Committee. He was alarmed by the possibility of the Khmer Rouge ever
                    returning to power. He felt it should be the United States' most fundamental
                    objective to prevent that ever from happening. We, too, felt that that this was
                    an important and fundamental objective and tried to assure him that we were as
                    serious about it as he was. There were others. There was Chet Atkins, who
                    represented a district in Massachusetts with lots of Cambodians. He was
                    extremely interested in the problem, and unlike Solarz, he would get emotional
                    about it from time to time. Tom Lantos, then and now a human rights advocate,
                    was actively involved in the issue. So there was a lot of interest on the Hill
                    and among foreign policy groups of one kind or another in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this interest express itself in their holding
                        hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: There would be fairly frequent hearings, letters, phone calls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how they'd tell you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, that's one ear cocked in that direction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, indeed. Solarz in particular was always extremely knowledgeable.
                    He had good sources and he kept closely in touch with people within the
                    administration and interested people outside. He was always impressively well
                    informed. It was a real challenge to go before a congressional hearing he
                    chaired. I came to enjoy it, though, and I came to like him. I think it was a
                    real loss to the country when he got gerrymandered out of his district, which
                    happened about six or eight years ago, maybe longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's later than this period, but it's an interesting
                        point you're making. Pressure from a well-informed source versus somebody
                        who is a little more emotionally involved and who isn't necessarily as
                        informed or sophisticated in their understanding of how to get out of some
                        of these things. Congress is an actor; the White House is an actor. Isn't
                        Karl Jackson...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Karl Jackson, when I became a DAS, was already the DAS in ISA for
                    East Asia, working for Armitage who had by then moved up to be assistant
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, he was at the Pentagon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Karl Jackson was very involved in the Cambodia problem and - have you
                    known Karl for some time? He was a Thai academic specialist. I mean he
                    wrote...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought Karl was associated with the Jackson School at
                        the University of Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't know about that. He was teaching at Berkeley when he came
                    into the government, but he certainly is of that (Scoop Jackson) persuasion.
                    He's close to Paul Wolfowitz. A good fellow. We did a lot of hearings together -
                    on Cambodia, on POW/MIA issues too, and on the Philippines. We were a good tag
                    team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that because the committee calls you or do you guys
                        decide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, the committee would call and I'd always be the lead witness and
                    he'd always be the second.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, but the invitation was theirs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. I think technically the Foreign Affairs Committee may not have
                    had jurisdiction or protocolary power to invite a Defense Department witness.
                    I'm not sure how that worked. In any event, if Solarz wanted a hearing, we were
                    there. Not only for Solarz, but other people. Those three subjects, POW/MIA,
                    Cambodia and then the Philippines were the three issues that took me up to the
                    Hill fairly regularly and indeed dominated my work during those three years. I
                    did about 35 congressional hearings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Karl your counterpart in ISA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We just talked about having regular meetings with your
                        counterpart in Korea. Are you having a counterpart meeting, seeing him every
                        third Tuesday?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Not so much one-on-one. There were a lot of phone calls and we talked
                    often in person, but we didn't have a regular meeting. What there was, was the
                    “East Asia informal” meeting which happened weekly in Sigur's office and brought
                    Defense, State, CIA, and the White House East Asia people together. When I went
                    back there as a DAS those meetings would include, in addition to our EAP bureau
                    DAS group, Jim Kelly who was the senior Asia guy in the White House, having
                    replaced Gaston, who had become the Assistant Secretary. Karl Jackson who was
                    DAS in ISA. Sometimes Rich - he liked to keep his East Asia hand in even though
                    he was Assistant Secretary for ISA by then. Carl Ford who was the National
                    Intelligence Officer for East Asia. And there would always be the East Asia man
                    in DDO. Dick Childress, also of the NSC, attended - if not Jim Kelly, then Dick
                    Childress, sometimes both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was at the NSC at that time. He was quite involved with
                        refugee stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and deeply involved in POW issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So, Jim Kelly is at the White House and you're
                        dealing with Cambodia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: With Dick Childress more than Jim Kelly. Because Dick was the
                    Southeast Asia guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, what kind of input is he making? And Karl Jackson,
                        and actually let's get back to Karl. What is the Pentagon position on these
                        Cambodian factions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: All of us were in favor of continued support for the NCR and we were
                    all kind of flummoxed about what to do about this problem in the long term.
                    There had been unsuccessful efforts over the years to get some kind of
                    negotiation going and that possibility was out there and needed to be addressed.
                    The ASEAN countries were becoming increasingly interested in potential
                    diplomatic solutions to the Cambodia problem. The Indonesians especially were
                    quite active. The Thais worked at it, too, but the Indonesians were particularly
                    interested in some sort of comprehensive, negotiated settlement to the problem.
                    The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Alex Alatas, was a leader on the issue within
                    ASEAN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because from their point of view I mean the Americans were
                        hard over on the Vietnamese. Americans were anti-Vietnamese, whatever that
                        meant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: You mean from the Indonesian perspective?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Indonesians always had a better relationship with Vietnam, for
                    basic strategic and political reasons, than the other ASEAN countries did. They
                    are an island nation. They never felt threatened by Vietnam in the way that
                    Thailand always did, so they were more inclined to try and find some sort of
                    solution that would respond to Vietnamese concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their view of it is here you have the Vietnamese
                        ensconced. The Americans are anti-Vietnamese whatever the consequences, and
                        the object is, where is a Cambodian actor that ASEAN or somebody can
                        support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We weren't “anti-Vietnamese”, and I don't think we were seen that way
                    by our ASEAN friends. Sihanouk was always viewed as the man who somehow
                    something could be built around. Sometimes he would conduct himself in ways that
                    gave credence to that idea and sometimes he would conduct himself oppositely. He
                    was seen as a perhaps frail reed to lean upon, but it was always felt that in
                    one way or another he was going to be at the center of a political deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually everybody is pretty stuck and so the Vietnamese
                        are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Vietnamese finally began to view their occupation as a losing
                    proposition; it was a major diplomatic hindrance to them, and a financial
                    burden. So they began withdrawing troops. ASEAN takes notice and so do we, and
                    that gives new impetus to possibilities for some sort of negotiation. That began
                    to happen I guess in '87 or '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your point of view it's day-by-day meetings and what
                        not that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't remember exactly the timeline when things happened. There was
                    a general evolution toward negotiation and a lot of preliminary meetings in
                    Jakarta and elsewhere that contributed to it. Cambodia was always a big subject
                    in the annual ASEAN meetings and the meetings that were held in-between those
                    annual affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting, because ASEAN itself only appears
                        above the horizon at the close of the Vietnam War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was the Cambodia issue that really gave ASEAN a noticeable
                    profile. The ASEAN members collectively had real clout, and they used it very
                    well. They were able not only to magnify their individual influence on the
                    subject of Cambodia, by working together, but to develop much more influence in
                    a general sense than they might otherwise have had. They were very skillful
                    diplomatically in the way they planned their annual meetings, for example.
                    Gradually those meetings became a “must do” thing for foreign ministers of big
                    countries. It was interesting to see ASEAN evolve over the years.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the other three main issues you were talking about
                        which was highly contentious is POW/MIA. Now, there is a domestic issue of
                        enormous import.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it probably had a more emotional content then than it does now.
                    There was a strong feeling among a lot of sensible people that we should have
                    done more than we did, in the course of the Vietnam settlement itself and
                    certainly in the immediate aftermath, to account for all the people who were
                    lost over there. Accounting for lost soldiers just wasn't as important a part of
                    the culture then as it now is. Now when our army goes to war, soldiers and
                    families know that everybody is going to be accounted for when they come back,
                    by one means or another. There were a lot of loose ends left on that issue in
                    1987, twelve years after the fall of Saigon. It had not been a high priority for
                    Carter, for Dick Holbrooke, for Brzezinski, for Vance - for that administration.
                    We were pretty close to normalizing relations with Vietnam without the POW/MIA
                    issue having been addressed very satisfactorily. We would have normalized had
                    the Vietnamese not invaded Cambodia in December of '78. That's my understanding
                    at least. So, when Reagan came in there was a whole new approach, and the Reagan
                    administration from its outset made this a serious issue. Dick Childress was the
                    guy in the NSC who was orchestrating it. He worked closely with Ann Mills
                    Griffith of the National League of Families, who is an extremely effective
                    bureaucrat and for years might as well have been a member of the Administration.
                    When I was there we treated her as such and she was actually a member of the
                    interagency group that dealt with POW/MIA issues, which I chaired. She knew more
                    about the issue than anybody else in the room and was a powerful advocate. She
                    still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The interagency group consisting of which agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, there would have been State, CIA, the White House and probably
                    more than one DOD representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meaning at your level, so it's Karl, you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Karl, me, Dick Childress, Ann and other odds and ends. Rich Armitage
                    had already made a trip to Hanoi early in the Administration and Dick Childress
                    had gone with him. They had kind of opened up the issue again, and by the time I
                    came on board there was already talk of sending a presidential envoy to Hanoi to
                    address this issue at a higher level and that took place later in the summer of
                    '87. It was August of '87 when I went to Hanoi with the former JCS chairman,
                    General Vessey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Let's focus on that trip. There's no

                        proposition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The contacts were done through New York and possibly to some extent
                    in Bangkok. The arrangements were made that way. Childress met with Vietnamese
                    officials in New York.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That we would send a presidential envoy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We made clear we expected some progress as a result of this, and that
                    real progress could lead to a resolution of the issue, which for the United
                    States was one of two issues standing in the way of normalization of relations -
                    the other being Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in fact if they were stuck in Cambodia, the only place
                        they could make some movement, they'd just been offered a new road. Now you
                        take this trip to Hanoi. How does one get to Hanoi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had a 707, a military version of a 707, a C-135, with some seats
                    in it. We flew from Washington to Honolulu, overnighted there, had some talks
                    with CINCPAC and then went to Bangkok. We overnighted in Bangkok and flew into
                    Hanoi from there.</p>
                <p>I remember there had been a fiasco in which a Delta Airlines flight had taken off
                    from Atlanta and had landed in Charlottesville instead of Charlotte or something
                    like that, and it was an incident that had been in the papers recently. So when
                    we came down through the clouds toward this primitive airport at Hanoi, landed
                    and pulled to a stop, the pilot came back and said, “Thank you for flying Delta.
                    Welcome to Rangoon.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take a break. We're now talking about POW/MIA
                        issues. At the time that you were there, those issues continued to have
                        emotional overtones for a strong domestic lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. Our objective was the “fullest possible accounting,” which is
                    not an unreasonable objective. There are plenty of people who think that the
                    whole thing is kind of a contrived issue, but in fact, especially if you put
                    yourselves in the shoes of a family member whose loved one never came home, it's
                    a different story. Particularly in those many cases in which there was good
                    evidence, including even photographs, of the person in question being held by
                    North Vietnamese troops or authorities, and yet he didn't come home and his body
                    was never recovered. Cases like that make it a valid issue and one I think has
                    been worth pursuing. We took it seriously.</p>
                <p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: This would have been August 1987.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: A presidential envoy, raising the issue to a higher level. As you
                    suggested, making it clear to the Vietnamese that progress on the issue was a
                    way to improve relations with the United States and that it would hasten the day
                    when the relationship could be normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom did you meet with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We met with the Minister of Interior, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                    and their people. Nguyen Co Thach was the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Vessey
                    met with Vo Nguyen Giap, the old general who ran the war for the Vietnamese. I
                    didn't sit in on that meeting. Several days of meetings. We stayed in the
                    Vietnamese government guesthouse, downtown, near the downtown park and lake.
                    Quite a rudimentary accommodation, but it was the best the Vietnamese had to
                    offer at that time. This was before development began in Hanoi and fancy hotels
                    began to be built. We took considerable care in keeping our internal
                    communications confidential, using something General Vessey brought along -
                    covered microphones to speak into, and earphones, so we could talk among
                    ourselves in the guesthouse without being overheard by our hosts. We also had on
                    that trip - the Vietnamese had to be pretty impressed by this - a suitcase
                    satellite transmitter that I had never seen before. It worked reasonably well
                    and we were able to send a couple of classified messages home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize these initial discussions? What
                        were the Vietnamese interested in? I suppose or what were they able
                        to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Vietnamese position on POW/MIAs has always been a little bit of a
                    puzzle to me. I was of the view then, and still am today, that they could do
                    better than they have done - because much of what we want is simply information
                    that they have in their archives, and they're reluctant to really open up those
                    archives and show them to us. That's the main thing we were pressing for in
                    fact. We also got agreement from the Vietnamese for more so-called “field
                    activities” in which we would send people in and they would go out to the
                    countryside with Vietnamese counterparts and sift through the soil in an attempt
                    to find remains. But the real trove of information was the archives, and we
                    wanted the Vietnamese to be more forthcoming. I think after that visit they were
                    to some extent, but we had to keep pushing, including over a couple or three
                    more such visits for them to loosen up even more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's interesting in that we're talking archives
                        because at first blush one might not assume that meticulous archive keeping
                        was a Vietnamese specialty. Germans yes, but third-world countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Vietnamese were very fastidious about keeping records of who they
                    had and what happened to them. We know that the Khmer Rouge were, too, when they
                    were killing people in Tuol Sleng Prison. They documented everything. The
                    Vietnamese had good records. They have good records. That's what we were trying
                    to get at. We then had intermittent lower-level contacts, and then another
                    Vessey mission, I think the following year, and then a third trip that I made
                    with Winston Lord when he was the Assistant Secretary in the Clinton
                    administration. That was the last time I went to Hanoi in this business,
                    sometime in 1993 as I recalwhen I was in Bangkok. The visits produced
                    incremental results. General Vessey felt that the Vietnamese performance had
                    improved more than Ann Mills Griffith and Dick Childress thought, and I tended
                    to agree with the latter two. I continue to believe that the Vietnamese weren't
                    cooperating as much as they could have. General Vessey dropped out of the
                    process; I think he was satisfied that he had done all that he could do, and he
                    was anxious to get back to his home on a lake in Minnesota. I have great
                    admiration for him. But there was still work to be done. There's still work to
                    be done, even today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's probably become more regularized. Isn't that always
                        the process we see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, we have normalized relations now and an embassy there and an
                    ambassador in place, and this should be one of his central issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, as you're dealing with POWs, you're having the
                        regular meetings with Ann, so there's that constant...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: There were regular hearings. There was an ad hoc committea
                    congressional task force - on POW/MIAs and it had slightly different rules from
                    normal committees. As I recall, it was co-chaired by the senior Democratic and
                    Republican members - Solarz being the Democrat. For a long time Ben Gilman of
                    New York was the Republican. We did a lot of congressional appearances on that
                    issue also—myself, Karl Jackson and Ann Mills Griffith. It was an interesting
                    and rather rewarding thing to be working on. I enjoyed my contacts with the
                    families. They were admirable people and were very grateful for anything we
                    could produce. The National League of Families is responsible, more than any
                    other organization or even the government itself, in my opinion, for changing
                    the way our country views the question of accountability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, down at the desk level, there is one individual who
                        does nothing but POW/MIAs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think there was one man on the Vietnam desk whose primary
                    responsibility was POW/MIA. It might have been Michael Marine during those years
                    - who is now going to be the new ambassador, I understand.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excellent. Another good China hand. That's how I look at
                        it, yes. I think he was deputy on the China desk for a little while or
                        political chief.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Let me get back before we go too much further, to Cambodia, because
                    of my triumvirate of issues, Cambodia was the most time-consuming during my DAS
                    years. The overall situation was more or less as I tried to describe it when we
                    were talking yesterday, but this too was an issue where there was a lot of
                    interest and pressure from the Hill and from other quarters in Washington -
                    because of the existence of the Khmer Rouge, because the Khmer Rouge were still
                    part of the equation. This was an issue people got emotional about. We clearly
                    needed to have a political settlement. It was clear that you couldn't simply
                    pretend the Khmer Rouge no longer existed, because they were such a key part of
                    the equation, unfortunately. The problem was to try to devise some kind of
                    scheme that would permit a transition toward peace while making sure that the
                    Khmer Rouge remained corralled in Pailin.</p>
                <p>In the first attempt at this - and this evolved from preliminary meetings that
                    were initiated and led by the Indonesianthe goal was a four-party coalition
                    government, including the Hun Sen regime, the Khmer Rouge and the two
                    non-communist factions, with some type of built-in guarantees against the Khmer
                    Rouge increasing their share of the power. That's what the 1989 conference in
                    Paris was about - an effort to reach agreement on a four party coalition
                    government. It just never got off the ground. We didn't make much progress in
                    Paris because of disagreements between ourselves and the Chinese - and between
                    others and the Chinese - about the role of the Khmer Rouge and how they were to
                    be fitted into this process. I led our delegation, and we had an interesting
                    month in Paris. But the effort collapsed.</p>
                <p>In the remaining months of 1989 there was increasing talk of a UN-administered
                    peace in Cambodia. This was a new idea, and something the UN really had not done
                    up to then. There had been UN peacekeeping operations, but there hadn't been
                    much in the way of a United Nations transitional administration of a formerly
                    warring area. It looked like it was going to be very expensive and unwieldy and
                    probably wouldn't work - but it was nevertheless talked about more and more. The
                    people who first put it on the table were the Australians. Then Steve Solarz
                    picked up the idea and began to talk it up in Washington, and it gained more
                    traction.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>In December of '89, right after the last coup attempt against Cory Aquino - and I
                    had been working completely on Cory Aquino preservation matters for about two
                    weeks - I had a commitment to go to Boston and participate with Solarz and Chet
                    Atkins, Congressman from Massachusetts, in a panel discussion at Harvard on
                    Cambodia. I was kind of worn out and had a bad cold and it was not a very
                    auspicious trip for me, but I took part. (I did some notes for myself, literally
                    on the back of an envelope, during the flight from Washington. When I sat down
                    at the dais next to Solarz, I glanced at his papers and saw that he would be
                    speaking from a typed text labeled “third draft”.) Solarz again raised the idea
                    of a United Nations administered peace for Cambodia, and asked what the
                    Administration's position was. We didn't have a position at that time. We hadn't
                    taken one. But I said the idea of a United Nations administration was a good one
                    and we ought to explore it. I endorsed Solarz' proposal. I did that also within
                    the bureau, and I wasn't by any means the only one who had begun to think that
                    this was the way we should be moving. As I recall, Charlie Twining, the Country
                    Director for Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia had been pushing the idea. In any event,
                    shortly thereafter we signed on to the concept of a UN administered solution for
                    the Cambodia problem. This was over the strong objection of John Bolton, who was
                    at the time Assistant Secretary for IO, and his deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the basis of their concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think cost, unwieldiness, dangerous precedents, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, here's the assistant secretary for IO who didn't
                        really...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He didn't want a UN-administered solution. In any event, that is the
                    solution that emerged and was pursued in talks and then eventually in, what was
                    it, September of '91, about the time I went to Bangkok, agreed to in another
                    Paris conference. Cambodia was an interesting issue because it was so complex.
                    We did have a rather ambivalent position that we were pursuing. We were
                    supporting the non-communist resistance with non-lethal supplies, that is to say
                    no guns or ammunition. They were fighting the same enemy that the Khmer Rouge
                    were fighting. Our friends, the Thai were certainly facilitating supplies, the
                    flow of supplies to the Khmer Rouge from China. It was a messy situation to say
                    the least. A lot of people felt that our policy was simply another example of a
                    mindless anti-Vietnamese crusade. They were wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In addition to that though, you're mentioning that our
                        assistance is non-lethal assistance. Now, that requirement comes from other
                        American experiences, doesn't it? I mean why isn't it lethal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: You mean from the Iran-Contra years?</p>

                        Washington, the basis for new policy guidelines? So in this case you can
                        help out, but it has to be non-lethal. Hence the U.S. policy toward
                        non-lethal has nothing to do with the contemporary issue. It has to do with
                        adjusting to some prior circumstance.</hi>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: I suppose that's true to some extent. There was never much interest
                    in increasing or changing the nature of our assistance to the non-communist
                    resistance during the time that I was in that job. We thought about it once or
                    twice, but it didn't make sense. Among other things, not only was previous
                    experience I suppose in the back of everyone's mindmore the war in Vietnam
                    rather than Iran-Contra - the reality in Washington and in the congress was that
                    this would not have flown and could not seriously have been pursued. None of us
                    envisaged Sihanouk riding into Phnom Penh in a tank, however well-appointed the
                    tank might be. That wasn't going to be the way things worked out. We were pretty
                    realistic about the military capabilities, particularly of the FUNCINPEC forces.
                    The KPNLF actually were pretty good. The idea was to keep them minimally
                    credible militarily, so that when a political settlement emerged they could be
                    players in it. They could have a seat at the table. That objective was achieved
                    in the final analysis. Our policy was successful. The KR were defeated
                    politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't the Vietnamese help out by knocking out the
                        Khmer Rouge? I mean if they had 200,000 troops...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: They tried. The Khmer Rouge were good fighters and the Vietnamese
                    were in something of a quagmire in Cambodia. They were hampered by the fact that
                    the Cambodians dislike Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You shouldn't invade a country that doesn't like you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Many Cambodians may by then have loathed and feared the Khmer Rouge,
                    but they also loathed the Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge were able to swim in that
                    sea. That's why the Vietnamese couldn't do it. It was not for lack of trying.
                    The Khmer Rouge in 1987 remained a very impressively capable guerrilla force and
                    a rather large one. You couldn't put together a political settlement without
                    taking that into account. It was an interesting problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a sort of INR question. Chinese support for
                        the Khmer Rouge. Were we viewing that as communists-to-communists or Chinese
                        anti-Vietnamism? I mean the Chinese had fought...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was Chinese anti-Vietnamism, and Chinese anti-Sovietism as well.
                    It was odd the way that relationship played itself out in that unfortunate
                    corner of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The actor the Chinese picked to associate with might have
                        been picked just because they were the most effective military force and
                        could have done the most damage to the Vietnamese. It turned out that
                        fighting force was the Khmer Rouge, the rest may have been somewhat
                        immaterial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, there was also an ideological factor, the KR had long-standing
                    connections with the Chinese communist party. We would from time to time go to
                    the Chinese, and ask them to start pulling the plug on supplies to the Khmer
                    Rouge in order to hasten the day when a political settlement might be
                    achievable. The Chinese were always totally non-responsive, and always stressed
                    that the KR had to have a role in any political settlement. Until then, the
                    supply line stayed open. That's what I was doing in Beijing in 1988, June of
                    1988. I went there to talk to a Chinese vice minister about Cambodia. I spent
                    about two hours with him and don't recall that I left with any kind of
                    encouraging message. The Chinese kept insisting that the KR had to be part of
                    the settlement process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we'd been talking to the Chinese through the
                        embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, there was this highlighted specified trip so they'd
                        have to focus on the issue. You were mentioning if the Thai were an actor in
                        this, we also probably were pulsing the Thai from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Indeed. Thailand's relationship with the Khmer Rouge was a point of
                    sensitivity with us and something that we kept tweaking the Thai on during those
                    three years I was in Washington and also when I was in Bangkok. We know that the
                    Thai army had regular and friendly contacts with the Khmer Rouge leadership. We
                    were never able to pin down some of the wilder allegations, such as that Pol Pot
                    actually lived in Thailand, in a compound down there in the southeast corner of
                    the country. We tried to track down such allegations when I was in Bangkok, with
                    all the resources we had, and we could never verify most of the rumors that were
                    accepted as fact by the media among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time was Prasong still in the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, he was when I was DAS. By the time I got out there as ambassador
                    he was not, but he was still very active in politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In politics and he was particularly concerned with refugee
                        issues if I recall. He held our feet to the fire about every promise we ever
                        made. In fact he was there from the fall of Saigon to probably the end of
                        his tour. My understanding is that he remained in that position by telling
                        his colleagues the Americans made promises to me on refugees and I'm going
                        to see that they fulfill it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: A very interesting man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any Thai refugee issues come up during your DAS
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, I'm sure they must have. I can't think of any specifics, but yes,
                    I'm sure they would have. We were always concerned about the maintenance of
                    first asylum, especially in Thailand, and of course the need for the steady
                    resettlement of refugees from the first asylum countries. I participated in a
                    UNHCR refugee conference in Geneva, in 1988 I believe. Maintenance of first
                    asylum was one of the main topics. Eagleburger led that delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's my impression that the Vietnamese refugees from the
                        fall of Saigon were a different group from the later Vietnamese boat people.
                        That in the 1980s the refugee flow changed. Lao and Laotian hill tribes
                        joined the refugee camps in Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: In 1987, and this was true when I went to Bangkok four years later,
                    we had approximately 300,000 Cambodians in those big camps along the
                    Thai-Cambodia border. They were regarded as displaced persons, not refugees,
                    because they would be going home when circumstances allowed. We had many
                    thousands of Hmong at Ban Vinai up along the Mekong and also at a temple complex
                    in the interior of Thailand. We had sizeable numbers of Karen and other Burmese
                    ethnic groups along the Thai-Burma border. It was quite an interesting mixture.
                    We also had a sizeable number of Vietnamese who had not yet found permanent
                    refuge. I don't know the numbers on Vietnamese refugees, but we were still
                    regularly getting people who had arrived there by land. They'd come across
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the refugee counselor in Bangkok at that time was
                        Lacy Wright. '86-'87 sort of period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I believe that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The refugees were always one of those friction points
                        between ourselves and the Thai and as I recall Prasong was the one that the
                        embassy worked very closely with to coordinate our policies. His job was to
                        keep us honest as he saw it in terms of the promises that we had made about
                        our responsibilities. By then a lot of these things, a lot of these camps
                        had been there since the '70s so they were very well set up. It was all
                        covered by the UN. You had individual NGOs. One NGO would do water, another
                        would do waste, another would be immunizations, another would do education.
                        It was a very well set up sort of circumstance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Something you mentioned earlier, the copious amounts of time the Department spent
                    trying to save Cory Aquino. How did those issues arise?</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Cory Aquino had become president, when, in 1986, as a result of the
                    “EDSA Revolution,” people power in the Philippines. She was immensely popular in
                    the Philippines and she was incredibly popular in the U.S. congress. She made a
                    visit to Washington shortly after taking office in Manila and was given what Bob
                    Dole called a “$200 million honorarium” for her speech before Congress. As time
                    wore on, she proved to be somewhat ineffective in asserting control over
                    dissident forces within the Philippine military. While I was DAS, I believe
                    there were no fewer than three rather serious coup attempts against Cory Aquino,
                    two of them carried out by the same guy.</p>
                <p>One of the frustrating things about the Philippines was that the Filipinos didn't
                    seem to take these things seriously enough, not as seriously as we did. The
                    perpetrators of coup attempts somehow found themselves back on the street after
                    a few months, ready to do it again. Some of these, a couple of these incidents
                    were rather bloody. A number of people got killed. Buildings were destroyed.
                    Artillery was fired and it was ugly. Nick Platt was the ambassador, Ken Quinn
                    was his DCM and they got very good at dealing with American community concerns
                    during fighting-in-the-street situations. They could have written a book on it
                    by the time they left. The last and I think the most serious attempt against
                    Cory Aquino's presidency came in December of 1989. I think there were a somewhat
                    larger number of military units involved and it seemed to be more threatening.
                    There were reports that the Philippine air force, such as it was, was going to
                    send planes up in support of the rebels. So we had a flight of F-4s take off
                    from Clark and they patrolled the skies over Manila to keep the Philippine air
                    force on the ground. That was our most direct intervention in one of those
                    situations. That one, like all the previous ones, failed and not too long
                    thereafter Cory Aquino's term came to an end.</p>
                <p>Eddie Ramos, West Point graduate and head of the Philippine Constabulary, took
                    over and that was a good stable period for Philippine politics. It was
                    interesting. I developed an affectionate view of the Filipinos. They had a real,
                    functioning democracy once again, despite the fact that some people wearing
                    uniforms didn't like that fact. The country seemed to me to be suffering in many
                    ways, in terms of economic growth and social development, but they were
                    justifiably proud of their democracy. They played the democratic game in a very
                    enthusiastic way and you couldn't help but be impressed. I always felt we were
                    doing the right thing, even though it was kind of frustrating and tiresome when
                    it began to be repetitious, to continue to support Cory Aquino.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When these kinds of Philippine crises come up I'm reminded
                        that we were mentioning earlier that you and Eagleburger and Phil Habib were
                        in the Ops Center at the time that Saigon fell. Now, here's, ten years
                        later, more than ten years later, a crisis in the Philippines. Are you going
                        up to the Ops Center, is a telephone being used better, what's the technical
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: There was an Ops Center group, a Task Force. We had a great Country
                    Director, by the waCharlie Salmon. He was a terrific help to me. We had very
                    good communications, easy secure telephone communications with Nick Platt and
                    Ken Quinn. So, I'm sure things worked more smoothly than in the old days. During
                    one of these coup attempts, the final one in '89, the President had just left
                    the country on a trip to Europe, so Dan Quayle was the “principal” in the White
                    House and we set up a video conference, which was a brand new thing then. A
                    secure video conference. Pentagon, State and the White House, and I suppose the
                    CIA. Quayle chaired the meeting - I understand it is mentioned in his book, as
                    an example of his ability to take charge in a crisis - and indeed he did a fine
                    job. That was one innovation that certainly didn't exist at the time of the fall
                    of Saigon.</p>
                <p>Before I leave this period of my life, let me mention my trip, actually I had two
                    trips, to Asia with Quayle. As a result of that exposure to him, I developed a
                    highly favorable opinion of the man. By the time we did this, Karl Jackson, my
                    old DOD colleague was his foreign policy advisor. The first time we went out
                    must have been early in the Bush administration, because Gaston Sigur went with
                    us and Gaston didn't stay too long after that transition. Gaston was replaced by
                    Winston Lord at some point in '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, let me look that up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Gaston was along on this trip. In any event, it was interesting to me
                    because there was some domestic politics mixed up with it. We took off from
                    Andrews Air Force Base in the morning and landed in Chicago, not at O'Hare, but
                    maybe a military facility, got in a helicopter, flew to downtown Chicago, right
                    down there among the skyscrapers, landed in an open area, motorcaded to a hotel,
                    went in through the kitchen like politicians do, and Quayle gave a speech to a
                    rather large group. Then we got back on the plane, after visiting a high school
                    out in the suburbs of Chicago, and flew to California where we repeated the same
                    scenario at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Pete Wilson and others were involved.</p>
                <p>We got on the airplane about 11:00 PM California time and flew to Honolulu where
                    we had a briefing by CINCPAC, around 3:00 AM Honolulu time, and a basketball
                    game. Quayle was a good athlete and played a good game of basketball. Then we
                    got back on the airplane and flew to American Samoa, where he made some remarks
                    in which he referred to the throng before him as looking like a group of “happy
                    campers.” This phrase was reported in the press and contributed rather unfairly
                    to Dan Quayle's lore.</p>
                <p>In any event, after the American Samoa stop, we got back on the airplane and flew
                    to Canberra where we finally got off the damn thing and could have a shower.
                    That was a 44 hour trip and it was really quite grueling.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Quayle did a good job in his meetings with foreigners. He, for example, met with
                    the Australian press corps in Canberra and I knew them to be a pretty
                    obstreperous bunch of people and he handled that situation quite well. He did
                    well again in Singapore where he had a meeting with Goh Chok Tong, the recent
                    prime minister, and Brigadier General Lee, who is now the brand new prime
                    minister of Singapore. He just took over last month. The subject was the press,
                    and Quayle was making the case for greater freedom of the press - and that's not
                    something that's integral to the Singapore system. Lee and Goh argued
                    vociferously against what Quayle was proposing, but he stood his ground. He was
                    quite articulate, and he didn't back down. He was personally very easy to get
                    along with. Clearly he was quite comfortable in having some very smart people
                    around him, including Karl Jackson and Bill Kristol, who was his chief of staff.
                    I thought Quayle was quite all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually you yourself had an interesting experience in
                        Singapore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I did. I visited Singapore in the summer of '88, and as a
                    routine part of a visit like that, the embassy set up a meeting for me with a
                    dissident - they are pretty hard to find in Singapore, but there were a few.
                    This was a young man, a frail young man who to me was quite unimpressive. We had
                    about a half an hour talk in the lobby of a very fancy hotel in Singapore, after
                    which I went back to the place I was staying and got in the swimming pool, which
                    I wanted to do earlier. A few weeks later, Tommy Koh, the ambassador to the
                    United States called me. He said he had to see (Secretary of State) George
                    Shultz that very day. I said, can I help you? He said no, he had to see the
                    Secretary. In any event George Shultz agreed to see Tommy Koh, which is
                    indicative of the way Singapore, and Lee Kuan Yew, Harry Lee, as George Shultz
                    knew him, were viewed by Shultz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't you have to do a paper, read ahead?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: There wasn't time. It was a matter of phone calls upstairs. I didn't
                    sit in. Gaston accompanied Tommy into the meeting with George and then told me
                    about it later. Tommy Koh had delivered a letter to George Shultz from Lee Kuan
                    Yew in which Lee Kuan Yew essentially said there was a group of officers in
                    George Shultz's department that were seeking to destabilize his government and
                    their names were Lambertson, Joe Snyder and Hank Hendrickson. Joe was the desk
                    officer, Hendrickson the political counselor in Singapore. He said he would not
                    disclose these names publicly in Singapore, but he assumed that Shultz would see
                    to it that they were disciplined and that this sort of thing never happened
                    again. I still have the original of the letter. Shultz was astounded by this. He
                    thought he knew Harry Lee. I thought I knew something about Singapore, too, and
                    I was shocked, truly. I'd been accused by a leader who I admired as much as I
                    admired anybody in Asia of trying to undermine his government. So I felt kind of
                    hurt by it all, and pretty damned mad also.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Clearly the dissident I met with had been questioned harshly. The Singaporean
                    police authorities had their methods and they must certainly have been applied
                    to this young man and he apparently made up a story about my having offered to
                    fund a dissident political movement. The situation quickly escalated. The
                    Singaporeans PNGed our political counselor, as if it were the Soviet Union
                    during the Cold War. So, we had to PNG a great young officer from the Singapore
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>Jesse Helms heard about all of this early on, through Bill Triplett. Bill
                    Triplett was constantly on the phone to me demanding to know what I had done and
                    why I was screwing up such an important and solid relationship. That's kind of
                    the way those conversations went. Helms wrote a letter to Shultz condemning my
                    arrogance and incompetence. It was just a generally unpleasant period. In
                    Singapore, things got to be quite frenetic. I was referred to as Mr. X and this
                    was the X, Y, Z problem in Singapore, their version of the X, Y, Z affair.
                    Darryl Arnold, who was the ambassador there at the time made video tapes of the
                    nightly television performances of Goh Chok Tong and the younger Lee. They were
                    clearly trying to demonstrate to Singapore and to the United States - and
                    especially I think to Lee Kuan Yew - that they were tough, that they were
                    prepared to defend Singapore's interests and stand up to the United States, and
                    their language was harsh.</p>
                <p>As far as I know, Shultz never had any doubts about me. I don't believe he ever
                    for a moment thought there was any truth to what Harry Lee put in his letter. He
                    never gave any such indication. He was quite solid and just shook his head and
                    wondered what the hell was going on out there. I think in retrospect there was
                    one issue that might have contributed to the outburst. We had recently rescinded
                    Singapore's GSP privileges. Do you remember what that was?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, general system of preferences. That means you get
                        breaks on tariffs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: You get breaks on certain things and by then Singapore no longer
                    needed that kind of help and they were “graduated,” that was the euphemism. And
                    I think they were graduated without being adequately informed in advance. So
                    they may have already been in a bad mood when I happened to go out there and
                    meet with the dissident. In any event, the Singapore government vented and after
                    awhile they calmed down and the relationship resumed its normal happy course,
                    with I think, however, a more realistic appreciation on our side of whom we were
                    dealing with out there, the nature of their corporate personality. I went to
                    Singapore again not long after, this may have been the trip with Quayle, and we
                    went to Lee Kuan Yew's residence and I sat across the table from him and he
                    treated me as if nothing had happened. I think some Singaporean officials, two
                    or three echelons down, were embarrassed by the whole thing, but I never found
                    one who admitted he was. It was a Kafkaesque experience for me; I learned what
                    it was like to be wrongly accused of something by someone who you in fact
                    admired.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But isn't that exactly a fascinating description, if you
                        will, of the Foreign Service management of a diplomatic relationship? There
                        was some ripple, it might have been the GSP, some domestic need, an actor on
                        their side who decided to be a little more macho this week than last week,
                        something else comes in and you've got to manage this so it doesn't spin out
                        of control. All balanced by your respect for Singapore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: True.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A professional respect as well as a personal respect and
                        therefore, you manage this relationship and you get over it because
                        otherwise you're saying, well, I can be macho, too. Then, where are
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact at the same time it wasn't in your portfolio,
                        well, wasn't this the time we've gotten crossways with the New Zealanders?
                        Or mid-Reagan administration '85 to '86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That was earlier. Several years earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That kind of spun out of control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, in both of those situations there were people in the congress
                    who, had they been listened to, would have made things worse. You have pressures
                    pushing you in a certain direction and you have to resist. Helms, of course, was
                    siding with the Singaporeans. He would have been happy if I'd been fired. That
                    would have been his preferred solution. Yes, you have to kind of absorb the
                    blows and keep your eye on the bigger picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, actually since Senator Helms had a black list of
                        Foreign Service Officers who would be held under water, to the extent you
                        later made ambassador, that probably is an indication that you didn't make
                        the cut. And I note that Secretary Shultz in his book Turmoil and Triumph
                        doesn't mention the Singapore incident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I must not have made that cut. I testified before Helms a number of
                    times on Cambodia and I think he generally agreed with the administration's
                    approach. On the Philippines and on POW/MIA issues too, he was comfortable with
                    our positions and there was very little he objected to. But this Singapore thing
                    was different. His man, Triplett, by the way, seemed to enjoy being
                    disruptive.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you'll find a lot of people who would go along
                        with that. Something you just said though, is it a proper characterization
                        of a Foreign Service career at this level of deputy assistant secretary that
                        this is the point in one's career where one has a fairly robust exposure to
                        the congress. You're going up to the Hill and testifying a lot. I mean desk
                        officers don't. It's this deputy assistant secretary level and above, some
                        of whom are career ambassadors or career people, and not necessarily
                        political appointees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I think it's the level in the Department at which domestic
                    politics really do begin to intersect with the work of Foreign Service
                    professionals and yes, there is a lot of interaction with congress. I think
                    there was more in my case than might have been normal because Gaston didn't mind
                    somebody else going up there and doing it. He was well thought of on the Hill,
                    but was in fact quite happy not to do the formal hearings. Moreover, he wasn't
                    as absorbed personally by Cambodia as he was by what in fact were some of the
                    larger, broader issues in his portfolio - relations with China, Japan, etc. He
                    wasn't a Southeast Asia guy. When Dick Solomon came in and became the assistant
                    secretary, Dick took a much more active interest in Cambodia. That was helpful
                    in some ways to me and complicated my life in other ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get into that, let me put on the record that at this
                        level of contact with congress it isn't just going up and testifying. I'm
                        under the impression you also see staffers on the side or brief them on the
                        side informally perhaps with other colleagues. So, there's a formal
                        presentation to congress and then there's an informal presentation to
                        congress, so that congress is a pretty major part of your life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. Especially when you have a guy like Steve Solarz leaning forward
                    a lot into your issues. I was especially careful to keep in close touch with him
                    which meant going up to his office from time to time, just talking with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Richard Bush.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: With Richard Bush or Stanley Roth as well. Stanley of course felt he
                    knew more than Steve Solarz did. That was a very good office and you needed to
                    take it very seriously and I tried to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Solarz was pleased with the people he had brought
                        together in support of the issues that were of interest to him. You were
                        mentioning that Solomon came in and sort of had a different feel for some of
                        the issues that you were involved in, and you had a little more hands off
                        relationship with Gaston. Would you otherwise want to characterize their
                        leadership styles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I thought Gaston was overall a more effective leader of the EAP
                    bureau. Gaston never had a lot to say, but when he spoke there were always
                    pretty good nuggets in there of advice and wisdom. Gaston was awfully well
                    connected within the administration, for example with Colin Powell and Rich
                    Armitage.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where does that connection come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Gaston's connection with Colin Powell probably came through Rich, and
                    he and Rich had been close for a number of years, I believe. Gaston was a man
                    who knew who he was. I guess you'd say he was “centered.” I liked him a lot. He
                    was a very stable, good man. Dick was more verbal, and more like a policy wonk -
                    he would have fit in well with the Clinton administration it seems to me. He
                    would have enjoyed those all night talk sessions in the White House we used to
                    read about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, actually both gentlemen were academics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, they're both academics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't Dick more or longer, I have Solomon...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Dick was Michigan and I think Rand and a very solid academic, well
                    respected as a Sinologist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Gaston had a different kind of academic background and a Japan
                    specialty, but that's where they came from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: GW now has the Sigur Center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In honor of him because I think when he left he joined
                        them and then unfortunately he died very shortly thereafter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He'd been associated with GW a long time. The main operational
                    difference from where I sat was in their differing personal interest in the
                    Cambodia problem. Dick put it at the very top of his agenda. Others in the
                    bureau complained sometimes that he was neglecting their issues, but he
                    certainly wasn't neglecting Cambodia. He was an activist on Cambodia. He was
                    always suggesting I should go here and do that, and he had some good ideas. He
                    once sent me up to New York to meet with a fellow who had been for many years
                    Undersecretary General in charge of peacekeeping in the United Nations, a
                    Scandinavian, then working at the Ford Foundation in New York. I did that, and
                    it was helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>On the other hand, Dick was willing to entertain what I thought were questionable
                    ideas of how you went about solving a foreign policy problem. One day he
                    introduced me to two Michigan political science professors, of the
                    “quantitative” school, who had devised a system they believed could accurately
                    predict the outcome of any international conflict if just the right information
                    were entered in. So they wanted me to help them come up with the right “inputs”
                    on Cambodia and they would then tell us how things were going to turn out. I was
                    busy at the time and really didn't want to play that game and I did not. Dick
                    realized it was counterproductive to insist that I should, so those people went
                    out of my life. I should add that Dick was a very agreeable guy to be around; I
                    liked him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually just as a segue to something else, I think I hear
                        you saying that at points the leadership can be so overwhelmed by issues
                        that triaging things...issues get left out? I mean can you overwhelm the
                        bureau leaders, if not the department leaders, with so many issues, isn't
                        there a point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: In this case, I think from time to time Dick's understandable focus
                    on Cambodia probably did cause him to neglect other maybe intrinsically more
                    important things. I'd been on the other end of that, certainly when I was Korea
                    country director. There were times when I should have gotten more attention for
                    my issues than I did, and that was because the assistant secretary was working
                    on China or Japan or something else. I think that happens all the time. There's
                    always an ordering of priorities and a triage process that goes along with it.
                    Any country director would tell you that. You've been in that kind of situation.
                    You can't get the attention of the people whose attention you think you
                    need.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The point is, you need their attention because to move the
                        process along, you've said what you've said at your level and that's blocked
                        now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Something more needs to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something more needs to be done in terms of raising it to
                        the attention of the next level because the assumption is that the next
                        level of people that look at it will add different weights to the issue and
                        then therefore come to a potentially different interagency resolution, but
                        if you can't get that attention or what not, then you're frozen. I mean
                        you've done what you can do at your level in convincing your
                        counterparts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Sometimes you have to push an issue to a higher level just to get a
                    decision. And sometimes you just need advice, from someone whose job gives them
                    a broader perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any time for exercise? Certainly
                        there're no golf games. The DAS business sounds very consuming.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It is very consuming and demanding. At one point when I was a DAS,
                    Elliott Richardson was back in the Department, consulting with L (Legal Affairs)
                    or something. He wrote an article for the Post or the Times on the Op-Ed page in
                    which he was making the case for greater resources for the State Department, but
                    he particularly cited the workload of DASs. (As a former country director, I
                    would say that country directors have plenty to do to keep them busy also.) And
                    he singled out the DAS for Southeast Asia, who had so many different problems to
                    deal with. I thought, what an insightful individual Elliott Richardson is -
                    because I did feel like I was pretty busy and doing rather important things. It
                    was a great job in terms of substance and what I felt I was accomplishing. I
                    think it was maybe the best I had, better than being ambassador, from a purely
                    substantive standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's also a platform from which you're looking at another
                        interesting issue that the professional Foreign Service is interested in and
                        that's political appointees. You're getting political appointees as
                        colleagues, as assistant secretaries, certainly the assistant secretary in
                        Asia has been a political appointee since Habib or Marshall Green probably.
                        Then you've got the ambassadors in the area. As those ambassadors come and
                        go in your area, are you saying, gee I wish we could have given that to a
                        career one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, although you know the realities are the realities. It was very
                    unlikely that a Foreign Service Officer was going to get to go to Australia for
                    example, although a few years later that happened a couple of times. Singapore
                    seemed to be pretty much lost to the career service. I think it will remain so.
                    I think Stape was the last career guy there. Yes, you think about those things
                    and you wish for a better situation and argue for it, but you're not surprised
                    when you don't get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mention it because it's my recollection that the
                        Reagan administration was the one in which the volume if you will,
                        percentage volume of political appointees was the highest. This had an
                        unintended consequence for the career service because a new Foreign Service
                        Act became effective in 1980. It adapted a military-like retirement systems
                        that said certain class of officers, if not promoted within six years, would
                        be dismissed. Six years after 1980 people started being dumped out of the
                        Foreign Service in part because there were no promotions due to the large
                        number of political appointees. Perhaps it didn't impact on Asia Pacific
                        bureau as much as others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think our ratio in '87 to '90 was probably about normal. We had
                    political appointees in Singapore, Australia, Korea, and Japan of course, and
                    China - but nothing out of the ordinary. I think that was probably about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thinking in a larger field from those early days in Saigon
                        to now you're the Deputy Assistant Secretary, what have you learned so
                        far?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, I suppose I'd learned something about the limitations of
                    American power. I learned that in Vietnam. I know I had learned an awful lot
                    about how foreign policy is made, the nature of the foreign policy machine in
                    Washington, DC, the role of the congress, the role of public opinion and the
                    need to keep those realities in the forefront of your mind if you're thinking
                    about doing something. I can't think of any great revelations, just sort of an
                    incremental accumulation of perspectives that you build up from year to year as
                    you're in this business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I asked the speculative question because at the end of
                        being deputy assistant secretary, then you moved as Diplomat-in-Residence to
                        Kansas University which must have given you finally some down time, some
                        reflective time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it was a wonderful year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: As my DAS term grew to a close there were no obvious onward
                    assignments for me, that is to say there was no ambassadorial opening that I was
                    interested in or thought I could get, and I left with a Distinguished Honor
                    Award from Dick Solomon, which Matt Daley wrote up for me. He was Dick's special
                    assistant. It was a very nice gesture by Dick - sort of a consolation prize for
                    not having a joalthough I also felt I deserved it. I went off to the
                    Diplomat-in-Residence program. I wanted to go back home. My parents were
                    elderly. In fact my dad died during that year, so it was great for me to be able
                    to be at home and see them regularly. I had a wonderful year at KU (University
                    of Kansas).</p>
                <p>I did a lot of outreach activity and odds and ends during the first semester and
                    during the second semester I taught what I think was a pretty darn good course
                    to about 50, mostly upper-level, undergraduates. By that time I'd been named
                    ambassador. I had my confirmation hearing in April, right at the time KU was
                    playing Duke for the national championship in our great sport. So, it was a
                    memorable year. I got a lot of nice publicity out here, too. It was a very
                    enjoyable experience all the way around. Sacie and I both had fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would suspect the average KU student's opportunity to
                        actually see and touch a real life Foreign Service Officer is rare, because
                        we were talking yesterday, there's 5,000 Foreign Service Officers and the
                        population of the country is 280 million. Even the retirees are mostly
                        gathered in Washington. When would you ever run into one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and that made it interesting for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This Diplomat-in-Residence program is fairly extensive. I
                        think there are ten or 15 positions around the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The Director General at that time, Ed Perkins, really wanted me to go
                    down to Atlanta, to go to a predominantly black institution. I can understand
                    that, but I just wanted to come back to KU. I think in some respects this is
                    just as valid a place to send someone like me or like you as is Morehead in
                    Atlanta, in terms of providing exposure to people who are practitioners in the
                    foreign policy business. There aren't a lot of them out here and it's good for
                    students here to have that exposure - and I think it's good for us to see this
                    part of the country. Ed, by the way, is in Oklahoma, isn't he? I think he's
                    working at Oklahoma University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think he is now. He's writing his memoirs because I
                        know the Freedom of Information Office has been working long and hard on his
                        request for his old documents. Jim Lilley did the same thing and what Jim
                        did was have the Department collect them up and then he read them in a
                        secure area and decided then which ones he wanted rather than keeping the
                        whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's a good way to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, it's a program that State has where presidential
                        appointees, not staff but ambassador level people get access to their
                        records on an expedited basis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's good to know. What I've done over the years, and I've found a
                    copy of what I'd done in Bangkok, as I'm packing out I go through the file and
                    write down the numbers of telegrams that I think I might like to look at
                    someday. I've got a list of numbers. That ought to help, right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Tom Barnes used to do that. So, you have this down
                        time, you have this time, but you were saying, fairly early on you actually
                        were offered an ambassadorial assignment. How does one...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, Ed Perkins called me, the president didn't call me. Ed Perkins
                    called me and wondered if I would be interested in going to Thailand and I said
                    I certainly would. The paperwork was done and I think it was made official and
                    announced by the end of 1990, before Christmas of 1990. Then, as I said, my
                    confirmation hearing was in April of '91 and it was a good hearing. Very good
                    attendance by senators, a lot of interesting questions. It lasted more than an
                    hour. John Kerry was probably the most persistent questioner. His questions were
                    about Cambodia and Indochina policy basically. I enjoyed answering them.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: You bet. Dole introduced me and Nancy Kassebaum, who was a member of
                    the committee, was there and had nice things to say. Jesse Helms was there and
                    had nothing bad to say. It was an exhilarating experience. But then my
                    nomination was held up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to there, you're a career Foreign Service
                        Officer, you've worked all these issues, you've just been a DAS, so there's
                        not much to preparing you to go up to the Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Not too much, although I'd been away from these issues for ten months
                    by then. I'd been out in Kansas. I hadn't been working on Cambodia policy, for
                    example, and there'd been some developments and I knew I was going to get
                    questions relating to that, so I had to do a little reading. I had a briefing
                    book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came to the desk.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that process I mean you're not wandering around

                        introductions? I mean you don't just stagger into Senator Dole's office,
                        have you heard I've been nominated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, I did stagger into Dole's office, being a constituent of his. I
                    had a couple of good meetings with him in his fancy majority leader's office in
                    the Capitol Building. I took the initiative to see Nancy Kassebaum, too. But we
                    had a good congressional relations man working for EAP, Chuck Morris, who was
                    very helpful to me.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. Moynihan held it up. He held it up because he was
                    critical of American policy toward Burma, and Burma had been part of my DAS
                    portfolio. There had been an election in Burma in 1988 and the Burmese military
                    ignored the results as you might remember. Aung San Su Ki's situation was
                    already of concern. Moynihan said we ought to be tougher on the Burmese. We
                    ought to tighten our sanctions. Moynihan was personally focused on Burma because
                    he had a staff member, married to a Burmese woman, who was really a kind of
                    Burma activist. I heard from him when I was in Thailand also. In any event a
                    hold was placed on the nomination and Ken Quinn, who replaced me as DAS, had to
                    deal with that issue. Finally, the Department tweaked the sanctions that we had
                    placed on Burma and added a new provision to them having to do with textiles or
                    lumber exports or something of that nature. That was sufficient and Moynihan
                    allowed the confirmation vote.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, I was the only one held up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, everyone else who was nominated...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: My nomination was the closest thing to something Burma-related, I
                    suppose, on the docket, so I was the logical hostage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Don Gregg mentioned that his whole class was held

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: This was just me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aren't you lucky?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. It was kind of irritating. It would have been very irritating if
                    it had gone on for much longer, but I didn't have a need to leave for Bangkok
                    before the end of the summer anyway so it wasn't a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an overlap between you and Dan O'Donohue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No. There's never an overlap is there? I've never known of an
                    overlap. The old guy's got to get out and the new guy's got to come in and
                    present his credentials. There has to be a gap, it wouldn't be seemly otherwise.
                    So, Dan left sometime during the summer as I recall.</p>

                        credentials on the 24th of September, 1991.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I guess that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Thailand, a monarchy, that must have been a very
                        interesting ceremony.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was very interesting. Sacie and I had just arrived. I had gotten
                    there in advance of Sacie as a matter of fact. We were staying in the guesthouse
                    because the residence was still being repainted. Sacie brought with her a rented
                    morning coat outfit from the States. It did not fit. It required safety pins
                    here and there to tuck it in and make it look decent. So, we did that.</p>
                <p>In Thailand credentials are presented to the king at his palace - Chitlada
                    Palace, an unassuming, Victorian-looking building, a long distance from the
                    Grand Palace. The Thai send a car to pick you up to take you there. It's not a
                    carriage, but an old yellow Mercedes, one of the king's Mercedes. So I rode over
                    there, with an escort from the palace, went into the palace, waited a few
                    minutes in a foyer downstairs and then was told that all was in readiness. While
                    I was waiting I was briefed on what to do: you walk into this rather long narrow
                    room, the king is standing at the far end of it, you make a sharp left turn and
                    walk toward him and stop six feet away from him. He greeted me and I greeted
                    him. I read my speech, and he read his speech. We shook hands, as I presented
                    him my credentials. We conversed for a few minutes and then I took my leave
                    which entailed backing up while still facing him for at least a number of paces
                    and then turning around and walking out. There were only one or two other people
                    in the room. Very simple. Very dignified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the king has been king since the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Since 1948. He's the world's longest serving monarch. Just ahead of
                    Queen Elizabeth. He's also the only king ever to have been born in the United
                    States, in Boston while his father was studying at Harvard Medical School. He's
                    a very interesting man and I came to admire him a great deal. I think he played
                    and is still playing a very constructive and important role in Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of us who have dealt with Thai issues have always
                        been very impressed with the king's deft touch and ability to be a mediator
                        from time to time when their society has needed it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That was dramatically in evidence in May of 1992 when the king
                    stepped in just in time to prevent what could have been an even greater loss of
                    life than had already occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get there, could you give us a description of
                        the embassy? When I was there in the early '70s, I think we were told we
                        were the second or third largest embassy, because you had the regional
                        couriers and the regional this and that, because it was a major
                        transportation center, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, and it was still big when I got there in 1991. I was looking at
                    an Inspector's report from my time there and according to the Inspectors, the
                    total number of people was something like 1,80600-some Americans, 1,200 and some
                    Thai, not counting contractor personnel, and not counting Peace Corps volunteers
                    of which we still had almost 200. It was a very big mission. It still reflected
                    a kind of Cold War configuration to some extent. Our intelligence presence was
                    large. JUSMAG seemed awfully big to me. Then there were a great many other
                    offices and agencies there, including, as you said, a number of regional
                    operations, because Bangkok was and still is today something of a transportation
                    hub. And it's also a relatively low cost place to have skilled people working on
                    your finances or what have you - the regional finance center was particularly
                    impressive I thought. I believe I once counted 26 separate government agencies
                    represented in Thailand, and the Inspector's report that I mentioned identified
                    35 or so “operating units.” I'm not sure what that meant, but it was a very
                    large embassy. It got slightly smaller during my time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many consulates did we have at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had three. Songkhla, Udorn and Chiang Mai. During the time that I
                    was there we closed Udorn and Songkhla. I certainly hope we don't ever close
                    Chiang Mai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the embassy's initiative or Washington's
                        initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was mutual. Washington wanted to do it and I couldn't justify
                    standing in front of the train. I regretted having to do it. As I mentioned to
                    you before, I like constituent posts and I think there ought to be other ways to
                    save money rather than to close constituent posts if at all possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Washington's interest, to save money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They closed my post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Your post? Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about what the embassy looked like when
                        you first arrived. You're saying it still is a very substantial
                        mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, indeed. It was very big, many different agencies represented. It
                    was clearly going to be an interesting managerial challenge in addition to the
                    other aspects of the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Vic Tomseth was your DCM? He'd been there through Dan
                        so he's pretty solid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: He's an experienced Thai language officer and it was valuable for me
                    to have him there, coming in brand new to the country except for occasional
                    visits. Vic was a very solid officer, very good judgment about the Thai and good
                    insights into the culture, so I was very lucky to have him. The political
                    counselor was Skip Boyce who had been there about three years at that time. Skip
                    I had known slightly back in the Department. He had worked for the
                    Undersecretary for Security Assistance. I think “T” was the acronym. He and Bob
                    Baurlein. Boyce and Baurlein or Baurlein and Boyce had carved out an influential
                    role for themselves in security assistance matters within the Department. I knew
                    him to be an accomplished bureaucrat. He was also a good political counselor. He
                    was extremely enthusiastic about Thailand. He had in three years of self-study
                    gotten quite fluent in Thai, and so he was a strong member of the team. I had a
                    good economic counselor as well, John Medeiros. Smart, very knowledgeable on all
                    the issues. In general I thought the people there were good. We had some
                    excellent junior officers, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were commenting that the structure of the embassy
                        reminded, still had aspects of the Cold War and the wawe'd organized
                        ourselves during the Cold War and yet by this time ASEAN is an important
                        factor, the Thai relationships with their neighbors, it's less of a
                        bilateral, I don't want to say less of a bilateral relationship that the
                        Thai had, but there's more going on in Southeast Asia now and more for us to
                        begin to watch I would suspect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I agree. It was a very different Southeast Asia than when JUSMAG was
                    established, for example, and we were fighting a war in Indochina and the Thai
                    were fighting with us in Laos, and there was a bilateral military relationship
                    with real teeth to it. Now we had only a vestige of that kind of relationship,
                    although a valuable one. I must say, those war years in some respects set the
                    tone of the whole relationship, and established a foundation we were still
                    building on, so to speak. Many of the Thai leaders, many of the military leaders
                    who had become prime ministers, had cut their teeth on the U.S.-Thai military
                    relationship many years before during the Indochina wars. We had personal
                    relationships with many members of the government that dated from those years
                    and yet, yes, in 1991 Southeast Asia was a very different place. One of the
                    newly important aspects of the relationship that we would have to pay much more
                    attention to in the years to come was bilateral economic relations. The Thai
                    were beginning to be a genuinely significant trading partner and U.S. investment
                    was building to impressive levels. Those kinds of issues were bound to become
                    more important in the overall mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact that would be underlined by the fact that American
                        investors weren't the only ones there. The Japanese had a high presence and
                        I suspect the Europeans would, too. It's probably a pretty competitive
                        environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: On the economic side it was quite competitive. The Japanese in fact
                    were dominant players in the Thai economy. This had begun as a result of the
                    movement offshore of Japanese manufacturing through the '80s, and they had found
                    Thailand a particularly congenial place to relocate. There were hundreds of
                    substantial Japanese manufacturing operations in Thailand. The Japanese also
                    continued to give huge amounts of low interest loans in their quasi-aid program,
                    so the combination of official flows of money and this massive flow of private
                    investment made the Japanese big players in Thailand. Bigger than we were. The
                    Europeans were also quite active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In addition to the businessmen's interest out there, the
                        USG was beginning at this time to be very interested in intellectual
                        property rights. I remember I was in Beijing at this time and we were
                        pressing the Chinese on this. An interesting conversation in which the guys,
                        our counterparts basically said, this is fine, we'll go along with it, but
                        you don't get anything more than Taiwan gave you. In fact I think you said
                        that most of your calls on government officials had to deal with economic
                        issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, a majority of my calls on government officials on economic
                    matters probably had to do with some aspect of intellectual property rights,
                    either copyright issues or pharmaceutical patent issues. In both cases, of
                    course, our emphasis on those issues reflected pressures from industry
                    associations in the United States - the Motion Picture Association and the
                    Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. But they had legitimate reasons to be
                    concerned about what was going on in Thailand. There was a tremendous amount of
                    piracy, of computer software, for example. Experts in the United States
                    estimated that the pirated share of software sold in Thailand was probably above
                    90%. It was very high elsewhere as well. You could find figures that high even
                    in places in Europe, and certainly other places in Asia. Even in the United
                    States a surprisingly high percentage of software, then at least, was considered
                    to be pirated. We had that issue to deal with, and certainly there were pirated
                    editions of every new American film easily available on the streets of Bangkok
                    shortly after release in the United States. We spent a lot of time trying to get
                    that situation improved and we made some progress, but I'm sure it's an issue on
                    the agenda for the American Embassy in Bangkok today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It raises an interesting question, to be successful,
                        doesn't the other government have to have enforcement mechanisms and laws
                        and all that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It has to have enforcement mechanisms and laws. But IPR protection is
                    going to continue to be a problem until the country in question begins to
                    develop its own intellectual property that it wants to protect. Then you see a
                    change in the culture. I think that has happened in a number of developing
                    countries. I think in Thailand it is beginning to happen. There's a change in
                    mindset that comes with growing affluence which I guess makes it easier for
                    people to afford the copyrighted versions of stuff, but also, as an economy
                    develops, it begins to develop its own areas of expertise and its government
                    leaders begin to see the logic of intellectual property rights as property, as
                    something that should be protected. And then with that come more effective
                    enforcement mechanisms. It's kind of a maturation process as economies develop.
                    I doubt that you can rush it much, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a probably an AMCHAM (American Chamber of
                        Commerce)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Oh, indeed, a big, very active AMCHAM. I remember my first meeting
                    with the AMCHAM board. It wasn't entirely successful because the AMCHAM had
                    been, and remained throughout my time there, vigorous advocates of opening up
                    trade with Vietnam. There was still a trade embargo on. I wasn't terribly
                    sympathetic with them in that first meeting. I said that in my view there were
                    two more important issues that had to be resolved before we got around to
                    opening up trade with Vietnam, those being POW/MIA accounting and the situation
                    in Cambodia. Nevertheless, I had good relations with the AMCHAM and I think they
                    saw me as a friend and a pretty effective advocate for their interests. I
                    certainly spent a lot of time, and we as an embassy put a lot of effort into
                    business-related issues, that is to say, insuring that the playing field for
                    American companies was level or even tilted in our direction. We had some nice
                    little victories in that area, American companies getting contracts that they
                    would not otherwise have gotten had it not been for our intervention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That intervention itself isn't, “hey, you have to do this
                        for us. We have a great company here that's quite capable of handling this
                        project you've got going.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. You try to always do your advocacy on a high moral plane, but
                    nevertheless, you're making a pitch for your company against what is probably an
                    equally good foreign competitor who might have better financing. The financing
                    package always seemed to be a key issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's true that you have multiple interests and you're
                        saying, okay, half of my time was on commercial issues, but you're touching
                        bases with the Thai on various kinds of issues. Cambodia, all kinds of other
                        issues and I would suspect that part of your presentation is let's not mix
                        the conflict over there with this enormous opportunity for cooperation over
                        here and try to keep things from bleeding one to the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, absolutely. We often had rather contentious talks with the Thai
                    on economic issues and generally we wanted to keep those isolated from other
                    parts of the relationship. I felt I was very lucky to be serving in Thailand as
                    opposed to some of the other ASEAN countries because I had such a very rich menu
                    of issues to deal with. The war in Cambodia - a settlement had just been reached
                    or was being reached by the time I got there - but still there was a tremendous
                    number of Cambodia-related problems to deal with. Refugees on the Burma side.
                    Internal politics. A very active military-to-military relationship. Drug
                    trafficking. A lot to get your teeth into. You know, shortly after I got there,
                    in the spring of '92, I went on the very first “ASEAN ambassadors tour” of the
                    United States. That meant U.S. ambassadors to ASEAN going back to the United
                    States, traveling around the country, touting Southeast Asia as a great place
                    for American companies to do business. This was prior to the financial meltdown
                    of '97 and '98 and there seemed to be unrelieved good news out there on the
                    horizon and we were all enthusiastic proponents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a private thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was sponsored by the U.S.-ASEAN Council, yes, so they paid the
                    bill. It was something that was advocated very strongly by Paul Cleveland, who
                    was then in Malaysia, and Bob Orr, the former governor of Indiana who was the
                    ambassador in Singapore - a very good one and a very thoughtful and innovative
                    and interesting man. I think it was his idea perhaps first, and then Paul
                    seconded it and eventually it was done. We went to five or six places on that
                    first tour. The group included myself, Paul Cleveland, Robert Orr, Frank Wisner
                    in the Philippines and John Monjo in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>In our first group presentation, which was in Portland, actually on the Nike
                    campus near Portland, Paul Cleveland said that he spent 50% of his time dealing
                    with economic and business issues, and John Monjo claimed an even higher
                    percentage. Bob Orr could have as well. All of them, I concluded, had less
                    varied portfolios than mine was at that time. Indonesia was in a stable period,
                    politically. The New Order was not yet shaken, and in fact John was able to
                    spend and needed to spend a great deal of time on economic and business-related
                    matters. The same was certainly true in Malaysia and Singapore. Less true in the
                    Philippines, and I don't think Frank Wisner claimed any kind of percentage like
                    that and I certainly did not. I thought of that often, that trip with my
                    ambassadorial colleagues. I was sure I had the best job of the bunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A minute ago you gave an exciting list of things that you
                        dealt with. Let's work on that list. Refugees.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: When I got there we still had a huge number of Cambodian displaced
                    persons in three major camps along the Thai-Cambodia border. The war was winding
                    down and yet the reality was the refugees, displaced persons, were still there
                    and the resettlement process was yet to begin and we were very actively working
                    with the UN, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the man killed in Baghdad. He was
                    one of the first UN people on the scene as the UN solution for Cambodia began to
                    be implemented. Repatriation of the Cambodian displaced persons was a major
                    project in which our embassy, and the refugee office especially, was very much
                    involved. We still had many thousands of Hmong refugees at the Ban Vinai camp on
                    the Mekong River and their onward journey to the United States was pretty much
                    assured, but they were still our responsibility. There were some sizeable
                    clusters of refugees along the Thai-Burma border. There the issue was the
                    occasional Thai effort to push them back into Burma, which we always vigorously
                    opposed. We kept a close watch on what was happening along the Thai-Burma border
                    to make sure the Thai were treating these people properly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You tend to find that countries of first asylum don't
                        appreciate the honor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. And over the years the Thai had a very good record. They have
                    given asylum to many thousands of refugees from many different directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume since the refugee issue has been with
                        Thailand since the fall of Saigon that things are pretty well organized. The
                        UN is there. All these NGOs. The camps are not ad hoc at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, the system was in place and it was working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the refugee section very large at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it was pretty large. I don't know how it compared to your days.
                    I don't know the numbers. It was certainly a sizeable group of FSOs, both in the
                    Orderly Departure Program and the, what was the other one called? RARefugee
                    Assistance Unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was just trying to think of that. Orderly departure
                        was still ongoing? Isn't that the one where they went to Vietnam and they
                        would make regular trips to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. To Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that started in '86 or '87ish period to sort of
                        try to cut down of people coming out and the danger then of first asylum
                        issues that came with that, we cut a deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: A system that would enable them to leave in an orderly fashion. Yes,
                    and I was always very impressed with that program. It was, in effect, the Saigon
                    Consulate General-in-waiting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a contractor attached to the refugee section
                        when I was there in '87 who did the interviewing for potential asylum cases
                        to the U.S. and I can't think of who that was..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The company you mean? The contracting organization?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I don't even remember the company because it had been
                        there for so long, we always knew it by the names of the guys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I can't remember the name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they would have been in a building up Sathorn Road
                        at that time in '87.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. That's right. You're absolutely right. That was a big
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, okay, so they're still there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, it was a big operation, and that would have accounted for many
                    of the large number of contractor personnel I was referring to in that
                    Inspectors report. They were these refugee interviewers. I'd forgotten about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That distracts me for a moment because when I left in '87
                        there was some new construction going on. When I was in Bangkok in '75 we
                        had individual houses we were in. I was actually [out of the area] and then
                        when I came back in '85 people were in apartments and something was going to
                        be done across the street. Was any of that in place? A physical readjustment
                        of the mission I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: What was ultimately done was that the new embassy was built
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, construction was initiated on my watch. I have somewhere back in
                    the basement the chrome plated spade with which the first dirt was turned. It's
                    a big, ugly building and I had nothing to do with the design. Plans were totally
                    in place, and construction was about ready to start when I got there. We used to
                    have a medical office, a medical unit over there, and some townhouses if you
                    remember.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Sacie and I did manage to affect the project in two ways, as I remember. We
                    insisted that footings for the massive perimeter wall be “bridged” over major
                    tree roots, so that some of those lovely old trees could survive. And at the
                    Dutch Ambassador's request, the monolithic wall between his property and ours
                    was scrapped in favor of a reasonably attractive iron fence.</p>
                <p>The embassy staff must be virtually 100% in apartment buildings by now; it was
                    almost that way even then, when I was there. Traffic was a terrible problem.
                    There weren't very many people who lived within walking distance. The quality of
                    life undoubtedly declined considerably between your first tour and your second,
                    certainly it had by the time I got there.</p>
                <p>To get back to Cambodia. The refugee business was an active one, to be sure. The
                    Cambodia settlement included an initial focus on the repatriation of displaced
                    persons to Cambodia. I might add that was an interesting time, because the UN
                    deployed into Cambodia in considerable part through Thailand and we were also
                    establishing an embassy in Phnom Penh during that period. More or less at the
                    same time. Charlie Twining went in as our first ambassador. That was a well
                    deserved appointment. Charlie was a long-time observer of the Cambodia scene; he
                    was one of the first to figure out what was happening in that country
                    immediately after the KR takeover in 1975. I think Charlie suspected that we
                    looked upon his new embassy as just another constituent post of Bangkok. There
                    were sensitivities that I had to be aware of, but in fact we tried to be helpful
                    to Charlie and his people in using our large administrative infrastructure to
                    help him get started.</p>
                <p>Our refugee people and some of our other people were directly helpful to the UN
                    operation as well. Bangkok was not the only avenue of ingress for them, some
                    obviously went directly to Phnom Penh, but for things happening along the
                    border, the logical place for the UN to muster and get organized was in
                    Thailand. I remember driving along the Thai-Cambodia border one time with an
                    officer from the refugee section and we passed convoys of Dutch armored
                    vehicles. They were painted UN white, but it was a Dutch unit in Thailand moving
                    by land across the border to the vicinity of Pailin. Thailand was very much a
                    staging base for the UN, and our embassy was quite involved in some of that as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your view of the Cambodian situation as Deputy Assistant
                        Secretary is high policy content, now you're ambassador to Thailand and
                        there are some hands-on things. I mean, you're talking to some of the
                        Cambodian personalities I assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I'd met most of them when I was DAS. And in those early months of my
                    time in Bangkok they came through every now and then. When they did I often saw
                    them, particularly Son Sann of the KPNLF and Prince Ranariddh once or twice.
                    That all tailed off as Cambodia became more “normal” and the UNTAC got
                    established and working, as did our embassy. But there was always the issue to
                    deal with of Thai policy and Thai actions along the border, Thai army complicity
                    with the Khmer Rouge - which UNTAC was very quick to identify and point to,
                    sometimes falsely. We had those kinds of issues during that first year. The
                    UNTAC people would say that the Thai were doing something nefarious with the KR
                    down there along the border, and Charlie's sources would say the same thing and
                    I would need to react to it and I would. We would investigate the situation and
                    try to get our own reading of what was going on and then make the necessary
                    representations to the Thai, because sometimes they in fact were doing something
                    they shouldn't have been doing. But fairly often UNTAC's [United Nations
                    Transitional Authority in Cambodia] info was wrong, and the Thai role was not as
                    negative as everybody in Phnom Penh thought it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But obviously we were interested in the Thai role and did
                        we organize ourselves to have an officer in the political section, perhaps,
                        that sort of had that portfolio and he would do traveling from time to
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: As I recall we did. We had the office in Aranyaprathet as well, for a
                    long time. We had the refugee people moving around along the border, and I'm
                    sure we did have somebody in the political section whose main responsibility was
                    Cambodia-watching. But we had a variety of people, from several agencies, out
                    there on the border, and if an issue came up we focused on it, tried to
                    ascertain what the truth was, and then we weren't shy in talking to the Thai
                    about it. The Thai role was often questionable; it was also often not quite as
                    unhelpful or negative as it was perceived to be by both UNTAC and our embassy in
                    Phnom Penh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually how did the Thai organize for the Cambodian
                        situation? Was the army in charge and the ministry of foreign affairs out of
                        the picture? Who were the main characters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The army was certainly in charge. The foreign ministry was quite
                    involved, though, in the political settlement and in the administration of the
                    UNTAC program. I remember one thing we did, Asa Sarasin, foreign minister under
                    the Anand government, invited the diplomatic corps to go into Cambodia just to
                    have a look-see at the initial relocation efforts of UNTAC. So, the diplomatic
                    corps from Bangkok was flown over to the border, loaded onto fancy buses and
                    driven into Cambodia by the Thai foreign minister. I'm sure that was not
                    terribly appreciated by the Cambodians, but there wasn't a Cambodian government
                    yet. UNTAC was in charge of the place. We went across the border, to the first
                    major town down the road from Aranyaprathet, I can't remember the name of it. We
                    visited there with the Japanese woman who was the head of UNHCR, Mrs. Ogata, and
                    with Sergio Vieira de Mello, among others, and looked at the operation that was
                    already underway to resettle people coming back across the border. The foreign
                    ministry was always involved, but in terms of security issues and what really
                    happened on the ground, the military was in charge and the military was
                    responsible, including for any misdeeds.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the key mission of the embassy is to figure out
                        what actor in the host country is doing the policy making...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Right. There was no doubt that the army was number one where Cambodia
                    was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a long history of concern with Thailand and the
                        narcotics issue. You surely saw this as DAS. It was a big thing when I was
                        there as late as '87. How does the narcotics issue come to you during your
                        ambassadorship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: By the time I arrived in Thailand, production of opium poppies within
                    Thailand was a pretty minor part of the problem. Various eradication campaigns
                    and crop substitution schemes and other programs had eliminated most of the
                    significant poppy production within Thailand. A couple of times I went out with
                    the Thai police on highly publicized opium eradication forays and I always
                    enjoyed it. We went by helicopter up into the mountains of the North, landed on
                    mountain ridges and trekked down to the open fields and whacked at poppies while
                    television cameras rolled.</p>
                <p>Of course, Thailand remained a major trafficking route for opium production
                    across the border in Burma, to some extent in Laos, but primarily Burma. In
                    particular, those areas of Burma controlled by the Shan United Army and the Wa.
                    They were still doing quite well and we tried various means of disrupting their
                    trafficking operations, and even their actual production. We kept picking at the
                    problem, and devoting considerable resources to it. DEA was a large office in
                    the embassy, and in Chiang Mai. The CIA also contributed to the effort, but
                    there was that now famous “wall” between the CIA and the Justice Department.
                    There was a limited amount that the CIA could do to provide operational
                    intelligence to DEA. Nevertheless, we had a few little victories. There was a
                    series of well coordinated Thai army and police raids against villages along the
                    Thai-Burma border early one Sunday morning that netted some serious, high
                    ranking traffickers along with some of their booty. It probably at least
                    temporarily disrupted trafficking arrangements along the border. We also
                    orchestrated, with the involvement of a number of agencies, a ruse that drew
                    back to Bangkok from, I believe Kuala Lumpur, a very high ranking Sino-Thai
                    trafficker. He was wanted in the United States. He was sufficiently high-ranking
                    that when we nabbed him at the Bangkok airport he was taken across the tarmac,
                    put on an air force plane and flown to New York where he appeared before the
                    Brooklyn Grand Jury. He was said to be the highest ranking Southeast Asian
                    trafficking figure ever “rendered” to justice in the United States. So from time
                    to time we made a small impact on the thriving drug trafficking business, but
                    I'm sure it's still going strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The drug situation also comes to the embassy in a slightly
                        different direction when Americans get involved, young tourists or something
                        like that. Did your consular section keep busy visiting people in jail?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Indeed they did. There were some tragic situations, particularly
                    involving young American women of very modest means who had been sweet-talked by
                    some guy into going to Thailand and bringing back a suitcase with something in
                    it. They were going to do maybe 25 years in jail in Bangkok as a result, and
                    there was not much we could do to shorten their sentences. We certainly, the
                    consular section, kept track of them, kept in touch with them, made sure that
                    their treatment was no worse than anybody else's in those Thai jails, but there
                    was not much we could do to affect their sentences. There would be an occasional
                    royal amnesty as I recall, around the King's birthday, and sometimes a few
                    Americans benefited from that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a consistent problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was a widespread problem, and I think generally anybody caught in
                    that net was simply caught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How major was that problem? I've heard other posts, the
                        women at posts having to organize ways to feed,...that the prison population
                        is so large that it's a sort of community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't recall, although there may have been community efforts that I
                    wasn't aware of on behalf of the prisoners. I'm sure the number of young
                    Americans incarcerated was way up in double digits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the main functions of course of the embassy
                        overseas is to watch the host country politics. Who's on top, who's in
                        charge. You were there at a particularly volatile time as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes. When I got there the Anand government had been in office a
                    number of months. There had been a coup against the previous prime minister less
                    than a year earlier, and, at our urging and that of other friends of Thailand,
                    the perpetrators of that coup chose a respected civilian prime minister, Anand
                    Panyarachun, and allowed him to name his own cabinet, and it was a cabinet of
                    technocrats. In terms of talent and integrity, it was probably one of the best
                    governments Thailand ever had. That government's mandate was to prepare the way
                    for an election the following year.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>So in the spring of 1992 an election was held, I believe in March (while I was in
                    the United States on that ambassadors' tour). The conservative, traditionalist
                    parties collectively won a majority of the seats and their first choice as Prime
                    Minister was Narong Wongwan, an upcountry politician, long and unfavorably known
                    to the United States. We were quite sure he was a drug trafficker. I'd seen the
                    evidence and did not doubt that he was guilty. In naming him as a trafficker, we
                    basically made it impossible for him to be prime minister. This was highly
                    publicized in the United States. The State Department spokesman noted that if
                    Narong were appointed prime minister, he wouldn't be able to travel to the
                    United States, so that would have been something of a handicap for him. In any
                    event the coalition dropped him and named General Suchinda - the head of the
                    army and one of the men behind the coup the previous year - as the new prime
                    minister. This sparked widespread opposition in Thailand. It wasn't just young
                    people protesting the military having in effect extended themselves in power. It
                    was an impressively middle class democratic uprising, such as had not happened
                    for a long time, if ever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, so what forces are boiling up in Thailand at
                        this time? Who are the main actors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: A middle class in Thailand emerged as the economy had developed.
                    People who were educated and who had sufficient economic security that they
                    could begin to worry about things like politics. They were intensely interested.
                    They had a more modern outlook, perhaps one could say, and believed that
                    Thailand should no longer simply be ruled by a succession of military figures.
                    At least that's what appeared to be happening. A “civil society” had developed
                    over the previous, say 20 years. It wasn't necessarily represented in the
                    political parties, but there were and are in Thailand some fairly effective
                    non-party organizations - associations of women, and associations of farmers,
                    and in particular in Bangkok, an affluent slice of society that had matured to
                    some extent - to the point that military coups and military government were no
                    longer acceptable to it. So, when Suchinda was seen as turning back the clock
                    once again, a lot of people in Bangkok - it was primarily a Bangkok phenomenon -
                    were ready to hit the street. That's what happened in April and May of that
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, those were very serious demands that the prime
                        minister resign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, indeed. As street demonstrations mounted, the army was called in
                    to preserve order and there were confrontations between demonstrators and
                    soldiers. There were ugly scenes of people being beaten with rifle butts and
                    this inflamed passions all the more within the so-called “democracy movement”
                    and tensions rose quickly. Things really came to a head in one night's
                    confrontation near the Democracy Monument when the army fired on demonstrators
                    and killed many of theperhaps one hundred. It was the bloodiest night in Thai
                    political history, at least since the early '70s. And it was an evolving
                    situation in which we, the United States, had an opinion and an interest. We
                    didn't like the idea of Suchinda naming himself prime minister. We didn't like
                    the idea of the army moving in in a ham-handed way. We were hoping that Thai
                    politics would continue to evolve in a democratic direction. So we had things to
                    say on the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom were we saying them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We were talking to just about anybody I could get an appointment
                    with. I made the rounds. I saw all the major players, including Major General
                    Chamlong, a former mayor of Bangkok and a very unmilitary military man who was
                    the leader of the pro-democracy movement. I had him around for lunch at the
                    residence. We had a good talk and I think I left him in no doubt that we
                    supported his aims, but that we hoped unnecessary confrontations could be
                    avoided, and a peaceful solution found. I took that same general line with other
                    politicians.</p>
                <p>I saw various military leaders and made pointed representations about avoiding
                    the use of force in dealing with these demonstrations. I don't remember exactly
                    when I finally got my appointment with Suchinda; I believe it was just after the
                    army disgraced itself on Democracy Boulevard, and I made a strong pitch to
                    him.</p>
                <p>I wanted to stay ahead of the curve. With the help of Vic and Skip Boyce, I tried
                    to anticipate both what was happening in Bangkok and what was likely being
                    thought about it in Washington. I wanted to keep the initiative and not simply
                    have to react to a series of instructions from the Department. By and large I
                    did that. We tried to think of things to do to ameliorate the situation and move
                    it along in a positive direction, before the Department thought of the same
                    things and told me to do them. I preferred retaining the lead. There was never
                    any particular point of disagreement with the Department or with anybody in
                    Washington about what needed to be done in the large sense. The discussion was
                    about tactics more than strategy.</p>
                <p>We had the Cobra Gold exercise going on at that very time. We had lots of
                    soldiers in country, and I pulled the plug on that exercise. They were
                    redeployed very smoothly and without objection from anybody on the military
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To close it down a little more quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: To close it down right then and get them out, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, actually that's something that generally takes place
                        far to the South.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It varied from year to year. One year it's “sea oriented” and there
                    are marines involved and sometimes a landing, and the next year it will be more
                    army and it will be further inland, with less navy involvement. The nature of it
                    changes from year to year.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, they weren't in the backyard. Nevertheless, it was unseemly for
                    U.S. forces to be exercising with the Thai army at a time when the Thai army was
                    certainly not distinguishing itself on the streets of Bangkok. I thought it was
                    better to break it off, and so we made that recommendation from Bangkok and it
                    was quickly acted upon, and there was no dissent from Honolulu or anywhere else.
                    It was actually more than a recommendation; it was a decision.</p>

                        collapsed. Now you can't have F-4s flying over, but you are trying to touch
                        bases with the main actors and to tell them...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Among other things, I was very interested in what the King might be
                    thinking of doing. I didn't seek an appointment with the King. I did contact his
                    senior advisors, however, to try to have some indication of what the King might
                    be preparing to do. They were noncommittal. It turned out that the King proved
                    to be very much on top of things and at the crucial moment did intervene. The
                    crisis was resolved when the King invited Suchinda and General Chamlong to come
                    to the palace for an audience, which was televised live. General Suchinda and
                    General Chamlong approached His Majesty on their knees, the King declared that
                    the situation had gone on long enough and was displeasing him, and it
                    essentially ended right there.</p>
                <p>There were no further demonstrations, no further confrontations between the army
                    and civilians, and within a few days Suchinda stepped down and Anand was
                    appointed yet again to run another government to prepare another election. I was
                    quick to make contact with Anand, to get his views on what was going on and his
                    thoughts on what we could do to help. I told Anand that we would certainly
                    support him in any way we could in the delicate effort to remove the army
                    leaders most directly responsible for the bloodshed. This wasn't necessarily an
                    easy thing for an interim civilian prime minister to do. But he managed it. They
                    retreated to the golf courses around Bangkok and never again had any kind of
                    political role. Anand was good. He did a great job of reestablishing his
                    authority, and he knew that he could count on our support. I think our embassy,
                    and our government, played its cards pretty well during that whole three month
                    period. We ended up earning a good deal of credit in Thai eyes for having been
                    on the right side of the situation.</p>
                <p>I might add that during this period I kept in close touch with the British
                    Ambassador, Christian Adams, a fine man and a good friend. We compared notes and
                    at times tried to coordinate what we said and who we said it to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the pressures that you were under, one of the
                        instructions from Washington had to do with the fact that congress had
                        stepped into the issue of military coups taking over governments and this
                        automatically cut military aid. Was that law of any help to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That had been in effect since the coup against Chatchai the previous
                    year, and military assistance didn't amount to much in Thailand by 1991 anyway.
                    It was an affluent place and we were selling them stuff, but we were also giving
                    them good financing terms so those credit terms were affected, as you know
                    having been in that business. It was nevertheless an important political symbol
                    - cutting off “military aid.” It meant something in Thailand and in that sense
                    it was useful and the restoration of it also was a useful potential carrot. We
                    urged that it be turned back on again as soon as it could be, which was done. I
                    think that law generally has a positive effect. It probably takes the pressure
                    off embassies sometimes, because of its automatic aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very pressured time for you and the political
                        section. How did you organize yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: This was a good example of Foreign Service officers stepping up to
                    the task and performing very, very well. There was some danger in going out on
                    the street and seeing what was happening and reporting on it. As I remember, we
                    had more volunteers than we really could use for the job. The political section
                    had junior officers from other parts of the mission stepping forward and saying,
                    can I help? Let us have a role in this. People were extremely interested and
                    attracted to the notion of being in on the situation. Officers of other agencies
                    were equally interested in being involved.</p>
                <p>I would meet with Vic and SkiDCM and Pol Counselor - and a few others, each
                    morning and I suppose several times during the day, to compare notes and talk
                    about how to proceed. I especially appreciated Vic and Skip and their experience
                    and good judgment. Other sections were also involveconsular, with its U.S.
                    citizen protective responsibilities, the Defense Attach�, given the nature of
                    the ongoing confrontation, USIS certainly, and no doubt others. We would decide
                    early in the day on reporting or analytical objectives. Skip, I think, made the
                    specific “beat” assignments, with Vic undoubtedly also involved. I think we
                    produced an excellent product, too. This was more than a dozen years ago, and I
                    don't have any reporting cables squirreled away, but I know at the time I was
                    satisfied that we were doing a very good job of staying on top of a rapidly
                    changing and dangerous situatioand I was a good judge of that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Well, word processors. There was an e-mail connection by then,

                    weren't using IBM Selectrics anymore. It didn't have to be printed out and taken

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We drafted press guidance every day; we wanted to get our version of
                    how it ought to be said back there. Generally our version was used, perhaps
                    added to or modified somewhat. And we did an awful lot of situation reporting
                    and a fair amount of analytical stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would suspect that knowing “how Washington works” you
                        probably would have put your finger on the USIA guy and say, look, I

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We had a good USIA gal at that point, Donna Oglesby. She could write.
                    She was quick. We did try to feed the Washington maw. Keep them happy back
                    there. And also, as I said, try to keep the initiative in terms of what we
                    wanted to do about the situation. I think it worked out very well. As I said, we
                    were widely seen in Thailand as having been on the side of the angels and that
                    helped us in subsequent months and years. The election then took place in the
                    summer of 1992, and produced the Chuan Leekpai government, with which I enjoyed
                    working. I thought Chuan and his people were an awfully good group. They weren't
                    any more talented individually than the Anand government, across the board, but
                    they had the virtue of being elected. They tended to be rather youthful.</p>

                    its competitors. I was fortunate to be able during most of my tour to work
                    either with Prime Minister Anand or Prime Minister Chuan and his cabinet.</p>

                        Southern part of Thailand. He's a sophisticated practitioner of Thai
                        politics all these years. He returns to parliament after the October '73
                        disposition of Thanom-Praphat, so here is a very sophisticated Thai
                        political operator I would assume. I mean he doesn't represent the military.
                        He represents in fact what the military used to hate. The military used to
                        say they would never ever let the Democratic Party come to power and now it
                        has. That must have been very frightening to the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I suppose to some. But the new army leadership, in particular the new

                    the new civilian government wouldn't have had a chance to succeed.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, Chuan was the leader of a coalition. I don't recall exactly what
                    other parties were part of it, but the Democrats didn't have an absolute
                    majority. I don't think any party had an absolute majority until Thaksin came
                    along and produced his. Thaksin was just getting interested in politics during
                    this period by the way.</p>

                    first meeting might have been about or when it took place, but I always found
                    him very comfortable to be around. He knew us, knew Vic Tomseth and Skip Boyce
                    very well and was comfortable with them, and we had a good relationship with the

                    Minister, Surin Pitsuwan. He might have been a bit young for you to have known
                    when you were in Thailand. He was educated in the United States, and for a time
                    was a congressional intern in the office of Geraldine Ferraro. Thoroughly modern
                    in his views, and a Muslim. I think he's bound to have an important role to play
                    in Thailand in the future in some capacity, particularly given the current
                    difficulties that they're having in the South.</p>

                        technocratic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, other individuals in the Chuan government beyond Surin. The
                    Finance Minister was outstanding, as was the Commerce Minister, Supachai, who
                    later became head of the WTO. As a group, they were young, but talentethough no
                    more than the Anand government had been.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact Chuan was prime minister most of your tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes he was. I think it was in the summer or spring perhaps of '95
                    that the next election took place and Chuan and the Democrats failed to retain
                    that controlling plurality, and the new Prime Minister was Banharn Silpa-archa,
                    a politician of the old stylan up-country politician. I don't remember much
                    about his cabinet. I left shortly thereafter and eventually, a couple of years
                    later, Chuan came back into office and fortunately for Thailand was in office
                    during the financial crisis of the late '90s. I think the Thai handled that
                    situation rather well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earlier you had mentioned that we were concerned about

                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Only in a minor way—there was one potential cabinet member who had a
                    less than stellar reputation.Somehow it became known that we were suspicious of
                    his background and he sued for libel, me and the PAor rather he threatened to.

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning earlier that one time Thailand and the
                        United States were side by side during the Vietnam War, a very strong
                        security relationship. In the post-Vietnam period what did the security
                        relationship look like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was then, and I think is to this day pretty solid. The Thai can
                    always be counted on to give us over-flight rights and transit privileges when
                    we're moving troops and equipment from the Pacific to the Middle East. We still
                    have that military exercise relationship. I think the Thai are present in small
                    numbers in Iraq right now. They can generally be counted upon to join us in some
                    fashion in efforts that we think are important. One thing did come up while I
                    was in Thailand in which we didn't get the answer we were looking for. I won't
                    go into detail, but we proposed something to the Thai that would have been
                    useful to us, strategically. We discussed it with both military and civilian
                    sides of the government, and at some point I proposed it to the Prime Minister
                    and talked to him more than once about it in the ensuing months. The Thai were
                    reluctant to agree, believing it might be controversial within Thailand and
                    perhaps within the region. But we kept working on it and I was cautiously
                    optimistic that when push came to shove they would agree to it, and I so
                    reported to Washington. Push came to shove during Prime Minister Chuan's visit
                    to the United States later that year, in an Oval Office meeting. We eventually
                    came around to that subject on the agenda and President Clinton noted that it
                    had been under consideration for some time and he wondered if Chuan could give
                    us an answer to our proposal. Chuan said that he could, and in his usual very
                    soft-spoken way said that the answer had to be no. I having been pretty sure the
                    Thai were going to say yes, would rather have been somewhere else at that
                    particular moment. I really did misjudge that one. I think I did so for kind of
                    classical reasons. I was too inclined to take what was in fact a noncommittal
                    response as a possible positive. I tried to read too much into what I'd been
                    told by Chuan and others. I simply misjudged the situation in a way that I
                    shouldn't have after 30 years of Asian experience. So, it was a mistake. No
                    lasting harm done, I suppose.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But often, I remember when Ambassador Brown came in he did
                        a parachute jump at the infantry training center, and everybody just thought
                        that was awesome. That gave him face and entree unmatched in the late '80s.
                        One of, actually looking at this cartoon, one of the old traditions, long
                        term traditions in Bangkok is the foreign correspondents club and the
                        invitations it extends to people to address the correspondent community as
                        well as Thailand at large. How would you say was the embassy's projection of
                        the American image in Thailand these days. I mean USIS is much smaller than
                        it was. There are other trends going on. How does the embassy approach those
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I think the ambassador is still in a position to make a big splash. I
                    am sure it is true today that the American ambassador looms very large in
                    Bangkok and if he wants to make a headline he can, unlike an ambassador of just
                    about any other country. So, if you want to get their attention, you can do it
                    via the press. That certainly was possible in my time there and I'm sure almost
                    ten years later it still is.You can be a newsmaker in Bangkok. American
                    ambassadors in a lot of places can be newsmakers - in most.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Concerning your term in Thailand, Bangkok, were you
                        honored with any presidential visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: No, I was not. I tried, but I just couldn't make it happen, either
                    with George H. W. Bush or Bill Clinton. Clinton visited not too long after I
                    left. We did have George Bush there a year after he left office and enjoyed him
                    very much. He was an easy man to have around. He came out under the auspices of
                    a couple of companies to make speeches and to be seen in their presence. I went
                    with him to a couple of dinners and we had him to the house during his stay and
                    invited the embassy staff. Virtually all the Americans came and many of the
                    Thai, and Bush spoke to them and stood there for a very long time shaking hands
                    with people. He was nice. I liked him then as I had ever since I first
                    encountered him in that water polo game in Saigon in 1966 or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably one of the more delicate aspects of the job of an
                        American ambassador to Thailand is the interaction with the royal family.
                        You presented your credentials under these very exquisite and protocol
                        filled circumstances. The king plays a role in the political events later
                        on. Care to make some other comments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I have great admiration for the King. He has played an important and
                    positive role in Thailand's evolution over the last 50 years and more. One of
                    the interesting initial aspects of my interaction with the royal family was the
                    fact that my presentation of credentials took place earlier than it might have.
                    The Foreign Ministry and royal household arranged the presentation promptly
                    because they wanted me to be accredited prior to the visit to Bangkok of the
                    Emperor of Japan, which came just a few days later. It was an interesting
                    courtesy. That was our first experience of a State dinner in Bangkok and it was
                    a magnificent spectacle. The Thai probably put on ceremonies more elegantly than
                    just about any other people in the world. A State dinner at the Grand Palace in
                    Thailand is really something to behold.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>In any event, at the beginning of the evening, the diplomatic corps files through
                    in protocol order and shakes hands with His Majesty and with the Emperor
                    standing beside him - so Sacie and I have now shaken hands with two Japanese
                    Emperors. Thereafter the diplomatic corps ends up at the other end of this very
                    long room, and the King and the Emperor are still in their places and people are
                    selected to go over and engage in conversation. The first person chosen was me,
                    the most junior member of the diplomatic corps, and I was asked to cross the
                    room and converse with their Majesties, the King and the Emperor. I did that,
                    and I don't remember at all what we talked about. We talked for five minutes,
                    mostly small talk I suppose. I thought it was most interesting and intriguing
                    that I was the one chosen to do that. I got the same treatment at least one
                    other time, during the visit of Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic. Once again
                    we'd all gone through the receiving line, and I was the one asked to go over and
                    talk with the King and Havel. Being the American Ambassador in Bangkok is
                    special.</p>
                <p>I saw the King on such occasions. I saw him on various other ceremonial occasions
                    when he presided. I came to feel that I knew him and that he knew me. I never
                    called on him by myself. Maybe I should have, but I didn't. I saw him in the
                    company of senior, important visitors from the United States, and then
                    frequently on those various ceremonial occasions. I saw much more of the Queen.
                    Sacie and I traveled with her to the United States twice, to Washington, to
                    Boston, Baltimore, New York. She was entertained informally at the White House
                    both times, once by President Bush at a lovely dinner in the family quarterat
                    the end of which he left by helicopter from the lawn for a Middle East peace
                    conference in Spaiand once by Hillary Clinton at a lunch. She's an outgoing
                    woman. Sacie and I also traveled with her within Thailand, to the royal villas
                    in the Northeast, in Chang Mai and in the South. We did three or four such
                    trips. She enjoys those outings and they were fun to be a part of. There was
                    always sumptuous food and spectacular table settings and a very warm
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Sacie and I also got to know quite well Princess Sarandon, the eldest daughter,
                    the Crown Princess. She's a very impressive woman, a student of many things. She
                    is serious about her role and she tries to perform that role to the best of her
                    ability all the time. I have a great respect for her and so do the Thai people.
                    My own meetings with the Crown Prince were also quite pleasant. Then the other
                    daughter in Thailand, Princess Chulabhorn is interesting, quite energetic
                    despite frail health.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>One of the most memorable evenings that Sacie and I had in Thailand was a going
                    away dinner offered by the Queen for us at her villa near Ayutthaya. We were
                    told that we would be guided there by a police escort and that we should wait at
                    the residence. The police escort would swing by and lead us to the villa. We
                    knew that it was going to be a late evening - both the King and the Queen are
                    accustomed to late evenings, and undoubtedly very late risings in the morning.
                    We sat there in formal clothes until about 10:00 PM when the police escort
                    rolled in and we were off to Ayutthaya. We reached the villa I suppose around
                    11:00 PM. We were entertained by a wonderful display of ceremonial dancing by
                    the side of the river, while candlelit balloons rose up into the evening air. It
                    was modestly spectacular, if I can put those two words together. Mighty nice for
                    an intimate dinner. There were 25 or 30 people invited. The ladies were all
                    wearing black because the mother of the King had recently passed away. There
                    were the usual lavish table decorations and a very lively atmosphere and it was,
                    as the Queen's gatherings generally tended to be, a genuinely enjoyable evening.
                    We got home around 4:00 AM, as I recall. I think that was an unusual gesture on
                    the Queen's part and I appreciated it very much, as did Sacie. So, our
                    experiences overall with the Thai royal family were quite positive. I have a
                    good impression of them and of it as an institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The King has certainly played an extremely important role
                        in Thai politics from time to time; as you have just illustrated during this
                        period, he's the one referee who can say “time out.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. He has immense influence, and uses it very carefully.
                    He seems to know when to act and when to husband his influence and over the
                    years he's played his cards very skillfully and to good effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've talked about you as a focal point for U.S. policy to
                        Thailand, bilaterally, multilaterally. Now, let's go back to the embassy and
                        some of, we've talked about who were in some of the positions. I think Matt
                        Daley comes in after Vic as your DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does an ambassador pick a DCM? Or do you get to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: You do up to a point. Vic Tomseth proposed to me when he was leaving
                    that we just let Skip be DCM. I thought, why not? Skip didn't have the rank for
                    it yet, but I thought he was mighty good. I went along with that suggestion and
                    proposed to personnel in the Department, I suppose the DG, that Boyce be
                    elevated. I was told that was absolutely impossible. He was not qualified by
                    rank and moreover it wasn't going to be good for him or the system to leave him
                    in Thailand for that long. That was probably true in retrospect.</p>
                <p>Lynn Pascoe was in the pipeline as a possibility. Lynn was in Beijing at the time
                    and was enthusiastic about coming to Bangkok and then something better
                    intervened, I don't recall what it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he went to AIT.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Did he go to AIT at that point? Yes, distinctly better. I don't
                    recall exactly how Matt Daley came into view as a candidate, but I presume he
                    contacted me. He was a good choice and I'd known him when he was special
                    assistant to Dick Solomon and in other capacities. He did a good job in
                    Thailand. Matt was then poached by Frank Wisner, who desperately wanted him in
                    New Delhi. At that point, Skip Boyce, who in the intervening couple of years had
                    been DCM and Charge in Singapore and was anxious as always to get back to
                    Bangkok, presented himself and was a logical, good choice as my third DCM.
                    Despite that turnover, I really had a good deal of continuity, especially with
                    Skip being there most of the time I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does the personnel system, your staffing, work as
                        ambassador? I mean do you really get involved in that or is that the DCM's
                        duty to pulse the Department and test their recommendations and what
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: It was probably both of our jobs. We didn't have many personnel
                    problems within the State contingent of the embassy during my time in Bangkok.
                    We did have one or two officers who I thought were not up to the job, and in one
                    case frankly should have been removed from the Foreign Service. We had one or
                    two issues like that, but by and large the staffing was good on the State side.
                    There were issues from time to time with other agencies, but there too, by and
                    large I didn't have any big battles to fight, with a couple of exceptions. Do
                    you want me to talk about those exceptions?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sir.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Both of those happened to involve the military side of the house and
                    that was a big side of the house in Bangkok. I don't know how many of those
                    600-plus embassy personnel wore uniforms, but quite a few did. We had an
                    organization called Stony Beach which was a DIA operation having to do with
                    POW/MIA accounting run by a colonel. We had another organization called the
                    Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, which provided administrative and logistical
                    backup for field offices in Hanoi, Vientiane and Phnom Penh. Also staffed in
                    Bangkok by a colonel.</p>
                <p>The Joint Task Force-Full Accounting was headquartered in Honolulu, within
                    CINCPAC, and was run by a major general at that time. The major general in
                    Honolulu did not like the colonel who ran the Stony Beach operation in Bangkok.
                    He thought that the latter fellow got involved in things he shouldn't have,
                    refused to take direction, and didn't see himself as a member of the Joint Task
                    Force-Full Accounting team - which he in fact was not. In any event the general
                    convinced the admiral, CINCPAC, to remove the colonel. I wanted to keep him; he
                    was a good officer and was doing a good job. But the Admiral was adamant in
                    wanting him out of the country. The upshot of it was that I lost my colonel -
                    who technically worked for me, not for CINCPAC. He had the same relationship to
                    me as the defense attaches did.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>I didn't like it at all, but there just wasn't anything I could do about it. It
                    was kind of instructive. It demonstrated a fact of life that probably still
                    holdthat if an area commander gets into a “control contest” with an ambassador
                    involving military personnel, he's probably going to win because he ultimately
                    has more weight, despite the ambassador's status as the president's personal
                    representative in a particular country. I suppose if the Department had entered
                    the fray on my side it might have made a difference, but I don't recall asking
                    for help—it wasn't that kind of issue.</p>
                <p>The second problem involved a triumvirate of other colonels. I'm not going to go
                    into detail. But a situation arose that I judged to be harmful to our interests
                    in Thailand, and that in my opinion also represented a challenge to my
                    authority. I fired two of the colonels. It was not easy to do. It effectively
                    ended their careers. It was traumatic for all of us quite frankly.</p>
                <p>The incident colored the last few months of my time in Bangkok in a way. Jesse
                    Helms found out about it, naturally, professed outrage in a letter to the
                    Secretary that a mere ambassador could fire two fine military officers in that
                    fashion, and demanded an investigation. To my knowledge the Department never
                    argued the issue with him and I got no discernible support from that quarter.
                    And indeed, as of the time I retired, I was being investigated by the Inspector
                    Generals of both the State Department and DOD. I don't know the outcome of those
                    investigations; I never bothered to try to find out. I think it probably had
                    been a while since an ambassador had done that. But in this case I think it was,
                    on reflection - and I've reflected upon it a good deal - I think it was
                    warranted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's hard to top. That's a very unfortunate circumstance
                        to be put in. You have a couple of more things in your notes. General
                        comments, if you wanted to mention them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I wanted to mention one of the best experiences that I can recall
                    from my ambassadorial yearand one of the earliest. It was a Chiefs of Mission
                    Conference, once again in Honolulu, in December of 1991. The 50th anniversary of
                    Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>Our COM meeting was held in conjunction with that huge commemoration in which the
                    president and others participated. We were at Pearl Harbor on the morning of
                    December 7, where President Bush gave an excellent speech. There were various
                    other ceremonies during the course of that day, and a reception that evening
                    aboard the USS Missouri. Around midday we retired to Hickam Air Force Base to a
                    conference room for a COM discussion, and we were joined about halfway through
                    it by George Bush. He stayed there for a good long time, I would think an hour
                    at least. We went around the table with people raising issues of concern to
                    them. I was struck by the degree to which the President seemed to be totally at
                    home with the issues, and the setting - the entire context - seemed to be quite
                    familiar to him. He fit in seamlessly, as he should have I guess, as a former
                    Chief of Mission in Beijing and in New York. I was impressed by how quickly he
                    picked up on the issues, how familiar he was with the kinds of things we were
                    talking about. I have thought of that meeting in recent years, and of the
                    contrast between the elder President Bush and his son, and their respective
                    backgrounds and approaches to foreign affairs issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Another thing that meant a good deal to me during my time in Bangkok was my
                    association with the aging members of the Free Thai Movement, the people who had
                    been organized in the United States after the Japanese occupied Thailand in
                    1941, were trained by the OSS and sent back into Thailand to do a little bit of
                    sabotage and a little bit of harassment. They were young college students in the
                    United States at the time of their recruitment and many of them became leaders
                    of Thailand in subsequent years. There was Sitthi, the former Foreign Minister
                    and a good friend, who suggested to me the idea of a dinner for them at the
                    residence. I readily agreed and we had a wonderful time. The guest of honor was
                    former Prime Minister Seni Pramoj, who was the minister in Washington in 1941,
                    and who declined to deliver a declaration of war on the United States as he had
                    been instructed to dinstead working with the OSS to recruit young people to his
                    country's cause. It was a memorable evening, with these very youthful and
                    spirited elderly people enjoying each other's company. It was great to see them,
                    and to reflect upon what they had been and what they had become since. We had a
                    second evening like that with the Free Thai Movement, but by the time of the
                    second, Seni Pramoj had died. I was very glad that we were able to invite him at
                    least once, and we loved it.</p>
                <p>We thoroughly enjoyed Bangkok. We enjoyed the visitors that passed through, by
                    and large, although there of course were some we could have done without. But
                    for the most part our visitors were people we liked having around. Sacie was a
                    terrific ambassador's wife. She ran a wonderful household and was extremely
                    hospitable and very good in her own outreach to the American community and in
                    her interaction with the Thai. Very, very good. The residence never looked
                    better than when we were there, thanks to Sacie. She decorated it with our own
                    art, by the way—we didn't draw on the Art in Embassies program. We did a lot of
                    traveling in Thailand, usually in our own vehicle. We almost never took the
                    official car or driver outside Bangkok on our trips, and we had some memorable
                    overnight train and bus journeys as well—modes of transport that were Sacie's
                    idea. She also thought we ought to stay in places recommended by the Lonely
                    Planet guidebooks, so we often found ourselves in Peace Corps-type abodes in our
                    travels. We saw a lot of Thailand that way, despite our inability to speak Thai.
                    We got around somehow, and enjoyed that aspect of Thailand immensely. Sacie did
                    a lot of traveling on her own as well, to some pretty remote parts of the
                    Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Speaking of Peace Corps Volunteers, we enjoyed visiting them from time to time,
                    generally in the company of Ginny Kirkwood, our terrific Country Director. We
                    also hosted every new incoming group of volunteers for an evening at the
                    residence, where I swore them in. I'm a fan of the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Americans have had a long and intense relationship
                        with the Thai and the ambassador's table depending on the incumbent was one
                        in which you could quite properly kick back and meet your contacts or give
                        them some prestige by securing their invitation to a small intimate
                        ambassador's dinner. Did you do some of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I did. You're quite right. It was probably a fairly high priced
                    ticket in Bangkok in 1991 through '95 and I am sure still is today. You rarely
                    got turned down if you invited somebody to dinner at the residence. We did a lot
                    of that kind of entertaining. Large dinners. Smaller business lunches. Some
                    breakfasts - including once a month for the AmCham board. We used that house
                    very fully during our time there. We also did a huge amount of
                    non-representational entertaining, e.g., with members of the American Embassy
                    staff and community. I'll bet almost everybody at the embassy got to the
                    residence, probably on multiple occasions, during our time there. I have a nice
                    painting upstairs done by the wife of an embassy officer - a quite talented
                    water colorist - of the residence, showing women and children walking in on a
                    Saturday for some kind of event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your representation funds hold out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: We never had a problem. We were undoubtedly out of pocket to some
                    degree because we were honest about not dipping into representation funds for
                    things that were not really representational. But in terms of actual
                    representation money, I don't think we ever were short. I don't think the
                    embassy as a whole was. I don't remember anybody complaining, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we've gone, always starting in Vietnam, but you've
                        gone to Washington at the highest levels in the bureaus, the deputy
                        assistant secretary and now to your mission. This is going to be your last
                        assignment. Do you see broader American issues that are illustrated in your
                        own career here, things that we're going to have to watch out for as a
                        Foreign Service and as the United States operating in Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: There's been such a dramatic change in priorities since 9/11 that I'm
                    not even sure I am capable of answering that question now. I am sure that for
                    every embassy, including the embassy in Bangkok, the war on terror is right up
                    there in first place, as the top priority of almost every part of the mission.
                    In Thailand that would mean further strengthening the security relationship, in
                    its broad sense, and working with the Thai to make sure that they're being as
                    effective as possible in our joint effort. But I have to think eventually we'll
                    get past this terror-dominated era. When we do, we'll find that the priority
                    that was beginning to emerge when I was in Thailand will reassert itself once
                    agaieconomic issues. Traditional security issues of the kind that we used to
                    worry about, wars between states in that part of the world, or externally fueled
                    insurgencies, are unlikely to be as important in the future. I think there is
                    likely to be a stable period ahead in Asia, assuming we can solve, or contain,
                    and move beyond the terrorist problem.</p>
                <p>The primacy of economic issues in Bangkok when I was there was to some extent
                    delayed, or obscured, because I still had those other older, traditional things
                    to deal with, like refugees, winding down the Cambodia war, drug problems, a
                    livelier than normal military-to-military relationship, etc. That's why I liked
                    Bangkok. But I think for that embassy in the future, and for all embassies in
                    that part of the world, if you can separate the terrorism issue, or if we can in
                    fact put it behind us someday, economic questions and issues related to trade
                    and investment will be back at the top of their lists of priorities, wouldn't
                    you imagine?</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Of course in that part of the world, looming in the background, will be the
                    growing influence of China and the implications of that for the U.S. That will
                    also be on the agenda for Bangkok and our other EAP posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume so, too, yes. You had the Vietnamese
                        experience and you were mentioning people along the way who served with you
                        who like yourself did very well in the Foreign Service. Would you say that
                        there's a relationship between those Vietnam years in either maturing those
                        people more quickly or creating a club of people? Or is it
                        serendipitous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I don't know. There were of course a huge number of people who went
                    through that experience ultimately. When I did it there weren't very many of us,
                    relatively speaking, but by the time the whole thing ended numbers of years
                    later a great many Foreign Service Officers had done their Vietnam time, either
                    voluntarily or involuntarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one time I saw a figure that 10% of the Foreign Service
                        was in Vietnam in the late '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: But perhaps serendipity was involved, too. I certainly thought the
                    quality of the FSOs that got together in August of 1964 to go out there in my
                    group was very high. Among their number were a few who did very well indeed.
                    Steve Ledogar was our senior negotiator on various arms negotiations in Geneva
                    when he retired, in I guess the mid-1990s. Frank Wisner, of course, rose to the
                    very top. Desaix Anderson had an excellent career. He should have been an
                    ambassador somewhere, but was Charg� in Hanoi. Rich Brown was an ambassador in
                    Latin America. I think we were unusually blessed; I'm not going to say unusually
                    talented, although there were some very good people there. But it's true also
                    that being in a place like that can give an impetuous to one's career. I'm sure
                    it did to mine. Had my first post been Medan, rather than Saigon, I would not
                    have become the sort of “known quantity” to people in the East Asia bureau as
                    rapidly. So it was good for me from a career standpoint. I don't know that the
                    same could be said for Wisner or someone like Holbrooke who was kind of a
                    shooting star from the very beginning. But for me, being in Saigon undoubtedly
                    helped me get a jump on the system and I'm sure that was true for others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It says here all good things must come to an end and so
                        you retire from the Foreign Service. You were showing me earlier a sign here
                        in the house. That sign says, “Home of David F. Lambertson, U.S. Ambassador
                        to Thailand.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. An official green highway sign. It stood on the
                    outskirts of Fairview. There was one on the east side and one on the west side.
                    Several years after I'd come home, the city fathers figured they ought to take
                    them down since they were no longer strictly true. My mother was chagrined when
                    that happened, but she made sure that she got both of them. I have one in here
                    and the other one out in the garage.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that goes back to where we started. If all Foreign
                        Service Officers are sons and daughters of the East Coast elite, I think
                        you're extremely out of place, sir.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you do in retirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I came back to the University of Kansas, where I have done some
                    outreach work and some teaching. I've particularly enjoyed teaching in the
                    honors program. I've done that intermittently since I've been back. I also had a
                    nice stint in California, teaching for a semester at Claremont McKenna College
                    near LA, under the auspices of the Freeman Foundation. That was the fall
                    semester of 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you are also involved in the KEDO organization. How
                        did that arise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I've been traveling to Korea, North Korea, two or three times a year
                    for KEDO, the Korean Energy Development Organization. KEDO is an outgrowth of
                    the 1994 Agreed Framework between North Korea and the United States. When that
                    agreement was reached in 1994, I didn't think much of it. It seemed like we were
                    simply bribing the North Koreans to stop doing what they shouldn't be doing
                    anyway. Over the years I've taken a somewhat kindlier view of it. Incidentally
                    when I was still in Bangkok, Tom Hubbard, who did a lot of the negotiating of
                    the Agreed Framework, called and asked me if I would like to be the head of
                    KEDO. I said I really didn't think I wanted to live in Washington or New
                    York.</p>
                <p>In any event, my Saigon roommate, Spence Richardson, at some point began working
                    for KEDO as the on-site American representative in Kumho, a place on the east
                    coast of North Korea where a couple of large nuclear power plants have been
                    under construction by KEDO. They needed another person to do that, and it
                    sounded kind of interesting to me, so I did it for the first time not quite four
                    years ago and I've been doing it off and on since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Four years ago, the year 2000?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I was in North Korea while the Florida vote count controversy
                    was going on. I wasn't sure which place was more bizarre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much time do you devote to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: On average over these last three to four years, two or three times a
                    year for five or six weeks at a time, or occasionally longer. I've spent well
                    over a year of my life now in North Korea.</p>

                <p>LAMBERTSON: Being the American representative in Kumho reminds me a little bit of
                    being in a very remote and very quiet constituent post. My colleagues in the
                    office are four South Koreans, representing the Foreign Ministry and other
                    agencies, and one Japanese Gaimusho man. Always one American. The official
                    languages of KEDO are Korean and English. The North Koreans think it important
                    that an American always be there. We meet periodically with our North Korean
                    counterparts if some operational problem arises. I have occasionally traveled to
                    Pyongyang or places in the vicinity of Pyongyang to participate in meetings
                    between delegations from New York, Tokyo and Seoul and the North Korean side. I
                    take a lot of books to read when I go to North Korea. Kumho is a good place to
                    read and write, and engage in athletic activity and that sort of thing. A quiet
                    life, but I find it interesting to live in a “denied” area, and to be the only
                    westerner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it's over-seeing the construction of the nuclear
                        substitute facilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: That's right. LWR power plants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That construction is actually South Korean, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: The project is funded 80% by the South Korean government and 20% by
                    Japan, roughly. The United States has virtually no financial stake in the
                    construction of these nuclear power plants. Our commitment was to provide heavy
                    fuel oil until the first of the nuclear reactors came on line. The whole
                    agreement is in limbo right now because in 2002 we discovered and confronted the
                    North Koreans with evidence that they had been cheating on the Agreed Framework
                    for several years by secretly developing a highly enriched uranium program,
                    which is another way to make a bomb. The Agreed Framework froze their plutonium
                    production program. Since then we've cut off the heavy fuel oil and as of nine
                    months ago the entire project was suspended, so there is no construction going
                    on right now. There won't be unless and until a new comprehensive agreement is
                    reached with the North Koreans in these Beijing talks and there's not much
                    prospect of that happening between now and November 2nd. The Agreed Framework is
                    hanging by a thread, as is this particular project, so every time I go out there
                    I assume it's probably going to be my last trip. It's not a long term career,
                    but it's been interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you get to go around the country. How does one get
                        from, what did you say, the East Coast to Pyongyang?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: I've traveled by bus south to Hamhung and then flown by AN-24 to
                    Pyongyang. I've gone by MI-8 helicopter direct from Kumho to Pyongyang, and
                    several times I've gone by road via Wonsan, which I find fascinating.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying it's a good place to get some athletic
                        exercise. I understand actually that's something that you're good at since
                        you ran the Hanoi marathon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Thank you for asking. I had a brief marathon career. I began to run
                    half-marathons when I was in Thailand. Tex Lierly of the DEA and a group of
                    embassy people were members of a running club in Thailand. They participated in
                    monthly races in some wonderful places all over Thailand, and I joined them - it
                    was great fun to do that. Then Tex said we ought to try the Hanoi marathon in
                    January of 1995, so I agreed and we practiced even more - early morning long
                    distance runs - and I ran the Hanoi marathon in January of that year. Did it in
                    a good time - three hours 25 minutes - good enough to qualify for Boston the
                    next year. I was interviewed at the finish line in Hanoi by a couple of
                    correspondents from the AP who were interested in the fact that an American
                    ambassador was in Hanoi running in a marathon when we didn't have diplomatic
                    relations. Was this a signal of something to come? I assured them that no
                    political signal was intended; I was just there to run a marathon. It was a nice
                    little interview and it was published along with my very good time in lots of
                    sports pages around the United States, including the Washington Post and New
                    York Times. That was very satisfying to a life-long sports fan and perpetual
                    aspiring athlete.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A sports aficionado. You were saying now you've run the
                        Boston marathon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Yes, I've done that five times. My last one was 2000. I don't think
                    I'll be running it again.</p>
                <p>Let me say, by way of winding this up, that for me the Foreign Service was a good
                    fit. I can't think of another way I'd have preferred to spend my working life.
                    Seeing that advertisement for the Foreign Service exam on my college bulletin
                    board in 1961 was a lucky thing. I have told the occasional audience, or
                    individuals considering the Foreign Service, that for me the advantages were
                    threefold: the ability to live and work in interesting places while representing
                    the United States, the opportunity to work with very talented colleagues, and
                    the chance, occasionally at least, to participate in significant eventrather
                    than merely be a witness or recorder of them, as journalists or academics might
                    be. That last is the most important. The Department can be frustrating and
                    infuriating sometimes, especially in its management of people. But all in all, I
                    had a good run and I am grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you like to give a 25-word description of this
                        beautiful farm that you have here in Kansas? This is amazing. It's been
                        wonderful. I thank you for the opportunity. You've got 80 acres?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>LAMBERTSON: Thank you. Yes, Sacie and I bought this place in 1996 and first built
                    a small cabin on it where we lived for three years while we were building this
                    house. We did a lot of the work ourselves. Sacie is a good worker and also a
                    good general contractor. This whole thing has been her project. The design is
                    fundamentally her design. The construction is quite innovative, and the house is
                    extremely energy efficient. It also proved to be highly labor intensive to build
                    and probably cost us more than we had budgeted for, but we have a very handsome
                    home.</p>
