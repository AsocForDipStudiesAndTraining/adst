                <p>RICHARD McCOY</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Bill Morgan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 13, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start off, Dick, with what brought you into the
                        Foreign Service. Briefly what got you this way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, coincidentally I served four years in the United States Marine Corps
                    and the last 26 months was spent as a Marine security guard at the American
                    Embassy in Copenhagen. From that assignment I drew great interest in the conduct
                    of foreign affairs. So I left the Marines and went to college and later on, when
                    the opportunity presented itself, I entered the Foreign Service in June of
                    1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, once into the Foreign Service, you eventually
                        got interested in consular affairs. What brought you in that direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, I was always interested in the consular function, even when I was a
                    Marine security guard, because I've always liked working with people. I
                    realized, in a very limited way, when I was in Copenhagen, that the consular
                    function primarily worked with people in various ways.</p>
                <p>However, I initially entered the Foreign Service as a general services officer in
                    an administrative cone, and after one year, in my first assignment in San Jose,
                    Costa Rica, they abolished my job. From that auspicious beginning I was
                    transferred to the consular section because, again coincidentally, the visa
                    officer left unexpectedly for another assignment so there was a vacancy. I was
                    asked if I would be willing to fill it for the remainder of my tour, which I, of
                    course, agreed to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reaction to that very first real exposure to
                        the consular function at relatively small post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MCCOY: I was very excited, although it was a difficult undertaking because I had
                    no prior training at all. I went right into the job. I remember the chief of the
                    consular section gave me an immigrant visa and told me to take it home with me
                    on Friday, since I was starting on Monday in the consular section, and to
                    memorize the various documents that went into it. Then he explained a little
                    about non-immigrant visas and said, “It's all yours.” So from that I began my
                    career as a consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean you didn't have a consular course in your earlier
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you survived it obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I survived. I had a lot of help from the Foreign Service national, in the
                    consular section in San Jose. This brings me to another issue which, of course,
                    is near and dear to consular cone officers as well as administrative officers.
                    That is, working with Foreign Service national employees at our embassies. Truly
                    in the consular field we have some very dedicated and very knowledgeable
                    employees, people who are well-educated and who perform very well for us.</p>
                <p>I can recall instances when I was assigned in Tel Aviv and again, maybe less so
                    in Turkey, but later on in Yugoslavia, where we had Foreign Service national
                    employees of considerable stature which greatly helped us in our protection and
                    welfare areas which in the cases of Israel and Yugoslavia were very
                    demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are those that say that some Foreign Service
                        nationals have such command of the consular section that the junior officers
                        who are often the ones that are supervising them just abdicate their roles
                        as supervisor and as leader. How do you look at that relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, that's true. What you have in many instances are junior officers in
                    their '20s coming in, and they are working with a Foreign Service national who,
                    maybe, has had 30, 40 years experience at their job. So there is a certain
                    element and it could also be that the national employee has a very strong
                    aggressive personality the FSO doesn't. But where I supervised national
                    employees at all my posts that I served abroad, I always emphasized to them that
                    I worked with them, that I accepted their advice, and that I found that that
                    stood me in very good stead.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>A number of officers conversely felt they had to prove, I guess, their sense that
                    they were officers and the other people weren't, and consequently you would have
                    conflict. Generally those officers fared badly, because Foreign Service
                    nationals had a great wealth of experience and they could help a young officer
                    along. So I always made it a point to have my officers be sure to work with
                    their Foreign Service national colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another part of that relationship between especially the
                        young officers and Foreign Service nationals is the unfortunate problem that
                        does creep in from time to time and that is bribery and fraud and other
                        mismanagement. How did you focus on the responsibility of the junior officer
                        in such things to make sure there was no instance of fraud and
                        mismanagement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: That, of course, is always very difficult: The result is that what I tried
                    to do was to have the officers and national understand the problem and to try
                    and work closely to prevent fraud et al. At the same time, they needed to
                    recognize that in the final analysis the officer has the primary
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the experiences you had in your first, say, almost
                        ten years, was serving in small posts. Any particular message there on how
                        you developed relationships with others in the small mission? Any small
                        mission, small post lessons that you have for us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: One of the things, of course, that you always learn in a small post, and
                    unfortunately they seem to be disappearing these days because of budgetary
                    reasons, is the ability to become flexible, to make sure you learn and function
                    in a large number of different Foreign Service areas. For example, in Adana,
                    Turkey I was into economic reporting, political military affairs, running the
                    post when the principal officer was gone, administrative functions, as well as
                    the traditional consular function, although we did not issue visas in Adana. The
                    same in Zagreb. In Zagreb I was involved in just about every area of the,
                    traditional Foreign Service function. And I found those experiences to be
                    extremely valuable later on in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going to a larger post like Tel Aviv, you brought those
                        same lessons along, but could you translate them now into what particular
                        lessons you learned at a large post, such as Tel Aviv, which has a very
                        large consular function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MCCOY: In a major post like Tel Aviv, you are truly locked into more or less one
                    area. Tel Aviv is somewhat unique because of its nature, from our perspective,
                    the administrative capital of Israel. We had tremendous numbers of distinguished
                    visitors, congressional delegations, and visits by the Secretary of State. So
                    you had a chance to do things other than just a straight-line consular job. The
                    advantage of a large post for a consular cone officer is that you learn how to
                    supervise both American officers as well as a large number of Foreign Service
                    nationals.The issue you have at a small post is there you're not so much
                    supervising large numbers of people, but rather you're starting to learn how to
                    manage a wide variety of programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have also, in a post like Tel Aviv, a high visibility
                        work and consular function, or to put it differently, you were closely tied
                        with economic realities of the country. Any particular messages there of
                        that relationship and how you worked particularly, perhaps, in visas, but
                        also in protection and welfare with the highly politicized society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Visas were fairly simple. We didn't have, in those days, a problem
                    relating to whether people would return or not. In fact, that was a rather
                    sensitive issue as to whether they would return, because in the war of 1967, you
                    may recall the Israelis returning in great droves from wherever they were around
                    the world. So that was not quite as much of an issue as, let's say, it would
                    have been in Costa Rica or in later posts like Guyana.</p>
                <p>Protection and welfare was extremely difficult. We had large numbers of American
                    citizens, many of them elderly, and quite a few of them with mental problems.
                    The result is that what you had was, from a citizenship, protection and welfare
                    area, the problems were much more difficult and intense.</p>
                <p>For example, one Christmas, I remember, we had a woman who was mentally deficient
                    show up with three children under the age of five. And the Israelis, even though
                    she was Jewish, did not want to accept her under the law of return. So,
                    consequently, I had a very difficult Christmas holiday that year. But
                    fortunately, through the help again of our distinguished Foreign Service
                    national we were able to resolve the matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would seem to be also, particularly in protection and
                        welfare, that you would get a lot of so-called intervention as we say in our
                        trade congressionals. What kind of congressional intervention, pressures or
                        from other parts of the government did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, obviously there was congressional interest, I suspect not as much as
                    there is now, though, primarily except for the issue of the Soviet Jews coming
                    out who immediately then would want to travel to the United States and would be
                    sponsored by some very prominent American citizens. The protection and welfare
                    issue was much more intense, but not as involved with Congress as you would
                    think.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that relationship or others, how did you find support
                        from the bosses, the ambassador or others in the post, in what you were
                        trying to do, in some cases almost contradictory influences bearing on
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: We had an interesting ambassador. He was one of the old-line Foreign
                    Service ambassadors from the George Kennan and Llewellyn Thompson era who had
                    come in in the early '30s, a man of independent means, a bachelor but a man who
                    would give us the time if we thought we needed it. He pretty much allowed his
                    DCM to run the embassy, and he concentrated primarily on the political and
                    economic issues that went on between the two nations, a bilateral relationship
                    which, as you know, is a very complex and important one.</p>
                <p>I had two different consul general when I was there. They both pretty much left
                    me alone which in some cases was wrong because I could have used some help. But
                    I must say, I learned a tremendous amount there, probably more on the protection
                    and welfare and citizenship than I could have in any place because, as you know,
                    at that time, we were dealing very heavily with cases involving people who were
                    serving in the Israeli army and who had voted in Israeli elections and this had
                    resulted in a Supreme Court decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Put differently, you feel you did get support then from
                        top management both practical as well as advisory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes and, of course, they were very, particularly the DCM was very,
                    sensitive to the desires of the officers in the consular section particularly
                    the more junior officers — that was my second tour — to get us involved in other
                    areas of the embassy. That was very important for us. I must say, I learned a
                    lot from that gentleman in terms of how an embassy should be operated and
                    run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What form did this take, this training of other junior
                        officers, and what kinds of things were they encouraged to do and could you
                        help them do in terms of their own responsibilities in the consular
                        section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, basically what you try to do is to explain to the officers the
                    function of their jobs, how they should perform them, the relationship in
                    dealing with the Foreign Service nationals, the culture under which they were
                    now operating in terms of dealing with Israelis and their relationships outside
                    the embassy. To develop working relationship with the police, local attorneys,
                    doctors and other areas such as prison visits. Then, of course, within the
                    embassy, if they are going to travel to make sure they touch base with the
                    political and economic section and the DCM to see if there is any particular
                    interest they might have.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did these junior officers, in turn, sense what they were
                        doing in terms of total mission objectives? Did they feel it was
                        important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I think so because in the case of Tel Aviv, in particular, we were all on
                    a roster to perform control officer duties, as one example. So, therefore, we
                    would find ourselves very much involved in the whole issue relating to that and
                    in addition to others. The DCM was very good about having periodic meetings with
                    the junior officers within the mission to make sure that they were reviewed in
                    the reading file frequently or went to staff meetings and other things of that
                    nature. And that was very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on to Georgetown, which was one of the more
                        dramatic assignments you had, is there anything else in those first couple
                        of assignments that you want to tell us about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: The Adana assignment was difficult because for a whole year we were under
                    threat of terrorist attack of the consulate. That was an interesting tour.
                    Zagreb was also fascinating in a lot of ways particularly because of, again, the
                    protection and welfare and working with the communist bureaucracy where
                    everything is politicized. It doesn't matter what your assignment is, everything
                    is politicized, and you have to approach your job from that perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though Yugoslavia supposedly has a special title to
                        its communist affiliation, it still has many of the attributes of a
                        communist state. Do you want to give us any examples of what it was like to
                        serve in a communist state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: For example, we had one American who was tried and convicted of espionage.
                    We found evidence that stolen U.S. military weapons were being smuggled into the
                    country by Croatian nationalists, and I was involved tangentially in that. We
                    had, for example, many social security trips, because we had over 5,000 social
                    security annuitants in my consular district. Some areas where I had to travel
                    were restricted areas by the Yugoslavs because of their military bases, and so.
                    I had to get special permission for that. So it was a fascinating assignment in
                    that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In comparison to Tel Aviv where it was also a very highly
                        politicized society, if you will, is there any comments on the relationship
                        with the bosses, with post management, vis-a-vis the consular function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MCCOY: I had tremendous support from my consul general in Zagreb. He was very
                    supportive and very helpful. The same for the ambassador who was for most of the
                    time a non-professional. So basically, I suppose, I've been very fortunate in
                    that in all the posts that I have served, I had great support from the post
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of us say it takes two to tango, however, which means
                        that obviously you knew how to extract the best out of the bosses. Any
                        particular examples or messages there, how to go about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I think I always made it very clear in all the posts that I served at that
                    I was truly there to support the mission. I wasn't there just to perform
                    consular work. And in many cases, particularly in Costa Rica, less so in Israel
                    but certainly in Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Guyana, I drafted numerous memorandums
                    of conversation which I think the embassy found very useful in its overall
                    political reporting program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words you weren't too parochial in your
                        responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, I was a Foreign Service officer first. And I think as a Foreign
                    Service officer you have to understand that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went on to be a real Foreign Service officer in
                        every aspect of the word in Guyana. Tell us what you first did when you got
                        there and then how the more dramatic days came farther on in your
                        assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I was assigned to Georgetown as the chief of consular section from 1976 to
                    1978 and not realizing it I found I was the second ranking officer in the
                    embassy. We did not have an ambassador there. We had a charge'. Six weeks into
                    my assignment there was a terrible incident that took place on a Guyana airline
                    plane that was blown up over Barbados in which a number of Guyanese were killed.
                    Apparently ten or twelve years previously there had been some very minor
                    connection between CIA and the organization, a Cuban exile organization, which
                    was responsible for blowing up the airliner.</p>
                <p>Consequently, because of the loss of life and the dramatic occurrence, the
                    Guyanese Government really had some harsh words for our government as a result
                    of which our charge was pulled out in protest. And there I found myself Charg�
                    of a Class III embassy with a fully operational CIA/AID/USIS operation as well
                    as the traditional Foreign Service sections. I was Charg� there for three and a
                    half months.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We had some very interesting times. For example, we had threats against the
                    embassy, to blow it up, burn it down, and in a wooden embassy building that's a
                    real threat. There were even threats to kidnap certain of our dependent
                    children, to take them to the interior.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough saner heads prevailed within the government and no outright
                    breech occurred. At one point, we really thought we were going to have to shut
                    the mission down and leave. Fortunately that did not occur, but there were some
                    very tense times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of support did you get from Washington from both
                        State and other agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Very little. Initially there was a lot of support, although it's always
                    interesting when the country in which you are represented, where you are, is in
                    bad odor in Washington, somehow that translates itself to the embassy people. So
                    it was fascinating to get these cables directing me to either have no contact
                    whatsoever, which, of course, is impossible or to make some very strong protest
                    in language which was quite frankly uncalled for. One example that I had to
                    confirm was when our Press Spokesman called the Guyanese Prime Minister a
                    bald-face liar.</p>
                <p>So that was my first experience in how I was going to have to run this embassy,
                    by dealing with a government which I wasn't suppose to be in contact with, in a
                    society where our embassy was being threatened, in which the policies, of
                    course, were non-responsive and our embassy personnel were under some indirect
                    threats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds to me as if the buck ended up on your desk.
                        Therefore, your dependency on the rest of the embassy and the other parts of
                        the mission was vital. How did you work with them? What kind of cooperation
                        did you get? What were some of the trouble areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Actually I had great cooperation from all political elements in the
                    embassy as well as the USIA director who was a man of some experience in the
                    country and, interestingly enough, from my Canadian and English colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they fellow sufferers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: In a sense, yes. The result being that I found myself though, having to
                    deal with primarily the substantive problems of the reporting which was simple.
                    The real problem I had was between my admin officer and GSO. They didn't get
                    along at all. And so that was creating some very serious internal problems
                    within the embassy. But fortunately, having had the experience of both being a
                    GSO and an admin officer, I was able to resolve those problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without exception there wasn't any real serious problems
                        of mission objectives under you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, I like to think there weren't. There were some serious problems
                    within the mission of people panicking because of the threats they felt, against
                    their families and in some instances we did allow some people to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to make those decisions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes, the Department was helpful in that respect, in helping me make the
                    decision in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then finally one day you were no longer charge'.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: That's right. The situation stabilized. Things calmed down. We had a
                    presidential election. The outgoing administration decided to leave things as
                    they were. When the new administration came in, they decided to try and resolve
                    the problems, and they did so by returning the Charge'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you could go back to your consular section and focus
                        on, not that you weren't before, but focus seriously on any developing
                        issues out in the hinterland which, indeed, there were. Do you want to tell
                        us about those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, yes. That was, of course, the People's Temple. When I first arrived
                    there, the People's Temple was a very small organization. It later developed
                    into a larger organization in the summer of '77 when, for some reason,
                    presumably because of problems in the United States, large numbers of Temple
                    members began an influx into the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us what the Temple was just briefly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: People's Temple was a pseudo-political authoritarian organization run by a
                    thwarted minister who developed, in effect, what was a cult or a cult-oriented
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was back in the period in which cults were almost
                        the thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MCCOY: No, this is when cults were almost unknown in the international area. I
                    mean, in a sense, that it was not something that we, in the Department, ever had
                    to deal with. I presume there are always groups of people, but they had never
                    really come to our attention in any manner.</p>
                <p>And, of course, the Temple initially had the Reverend Jim Jones, its titular
                    head, who had initially been the head of the San Francisco Housing Authority. He
                    had developed a very tightly organized cadre, around him out of about ten to
                    twelve people, and then had an organization of probably 1500 members. They
                    developed an area in northwest Guyana with the help of the local populace, and
                    had cleared an area of about 450 to 600 acres. They were developing quite an
                    agricultural community. They had electricity. They had refrigeration. They had
                    chickens and pigs. They had set up prefabricated housing. They were trying to be
                    self-sufficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had the support of the government then. Why? Why
                        would the Guyana Government want them there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: The government wanted them there for two reasons. One, the government was
                    having a very serious problem with finances. At least one percent of the entire
                    population of 800,000 people were listed with us for immigration to the United
                    States and that didn't count those leaving to go to Great Britain or to Canada.
                    So, consequently, the fact a group of Americans would come to Guyana and wish to
                    live was a great propaganda ploy for them. Also, the government of Guyana
                    purported to be a Marxist government. The People's Temple organization claimed
                    to be organized along Marxist-socialist lines and had a political philosophy
                    very akin to Marxism. And so, as a result, both from a political and public
                    relations standpoint, the People's Temple was very welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point did you start finding yourself really
                        involved with the group, what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: My initial contact came when I was Charg� in December, 1976 when Reverend
                    Jones came in with the Lieutenant Governor of California, a man who's now a
                    member of Congress, Mervin Dymally. He wanted to visit the community because it
                    was made up predominately of people from California. As Charg�, because he was
                    Lieutenant Governor, I went and paid a call on him and Rev. Jones. The situation
                    vis-a-vis the People's Temple at that time, seemed relatively normal.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Then in the summer of 1977, large groups of Temple members began coming to
                    Guyana, and certain members of the security immigrations services of Guyana
                    began to be a little bit concerned about what their overall motive was. This
                    suspicion was, I think, primarily because they couldn't believe Americans would
                    really, truly want to come and live in Guyana. So they considered there was an
                    ulterior motive behind this entry of large groups of Americans.</p>
                <p>In addition to that, we began to get press reports about the People's Temple and
                    its organization relating to such things as threats of intimidation, coercion,
                    and physical abuse. And I began to get letters from relatives of members of the
                    Temple who were in Guyana to please check on them to see if they were all
                    right.</p>
                <p>As a result of this, I made my first visit to Jonestown in, I believe it was,
                    August, 1977. This was a first of several visits. I recall going up into the
                    Northwest District. Now, one of the things you have to understand is when you go
                    into the Northwest District of Guyana, it's not like getting into your car and
                    driving 150 miles and going somewhere. Guyana, outside of the Georgetown area,
                    is very isolated and remote. The only way you could get there was by airplane
                    because you crossed about 100 miles of truly trackless jungle because, after
                    all, you're in the Orinoco Basin there. It's right up near the border of
                    Venezuela, which brings another point to mind.</p>
                <p>The Guyanese were also very happy that this American group moved in where they
                    did because they were very concerned about Venezuelan territorial claims against
                    that part of Guyana. They felt that this would create a buffer zone for them in
                    that regard.</p>
                <p>So I flew to Northwest District, met with the regional officer of the government
                    there who proceeded immediately to tell me that he had a member of the People's
                    Temple in their local clinic who was claiming that he had been mistreated and
                    abused by members of the Temple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the government official helpful, responsive to
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes, very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't fighting your being there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Oh, no. They were very concerned. He was very concerned. So I went and
                    talked to this man. He, of course, denied any abuse on the part of the Temple,
                    claimed that the scars he had were from handling rough lumber. He had some scars
                    on the top of shoulders and cuts there. So I asked him if he wanted to go back
                    to the United States. He said, “Yes.” I said, “Fine.” And I did arrange for him
                    to go back to the United States, at People's Temple expense, I might add. And so
                    the Temple arranged for him to return to the United States. However, the
                    regional officer there still had some lingering suspicion that things were all
                    not well.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your first impression of the physical layout of
                        the camp?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: The first impression you have is that it's quite an impressive
                    undertaking. I mean, this is a very rough, underdeveloped country where the
                    climate was not too bad because you're up 2,000 feet there, but still it's heavy
                    jungle with all the problems of the climate, wild animals, etc. They had
                    obviously made quite an investment there. They had their own mill where they
                    could make these prefabricated houses where they had tin roofs and wooden floors
                    and things. And they were pretty well built, not something maybe you or I would
                    like to live in, but certainly, in terms of that area, quite substantial. Some
                    of the other things they had were a refrigeration plant and egg hatchery and
                    things of that nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then over the next few months, or whatever period it
                        was, you began to get more reports and was it always you going there or did
                        you send someone else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No, I always went. The ambassador decided it was important that I go
                    because my vice consuls were all first tour junior officers. He and I both
                    decided that this was a very sophisticated problem. After all, up to now there
                    had been no examples in the Foreign Service, that anyone knew, in dealing with
                    this kind of situation. We were dealing with American citizens. We were getting
                    complaints about American citizens being abused by other American citizens. Plus
                    when you have the new passage of the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information
                    Act, this created in itself some very difficult legal problems for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop the clock there before we get into the full
                        tragedy of that. What kind of support and advice were you getting from the
                        Department? I sense good support from the ambassador, but again what kinds
                        of support from the mission itself as well as the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: As I indicated to you, the ambassador was extremely supportive. He was a
                    very experienced career professional who had arrived in Georgetown in the summer
                    of 1977 and who realized that service in the Caribbean meant that the consular
                    function was a very important element within the embassy overall because of the
                    nature of our bilateral relationships created by this heavy demand for
                    visas.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>So when the People's Temple issue came up, we consulted almost daily because
                    there were some other ancillary problems. For example, there was a child custody
                    case that was going on at the same time which was creating a great deal of
                    interest in the government. The Temple was on one side opposing the parents who
                    were trying to get their child back and who were former senior Temple members.
                    That was one side. Then we were getting an increasing number of requests to look
                    into allegations of abuse up at Jonestown. So, consequently, I made another
                    trip.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I decided early on, because of the uncertain nature of
                    what this was all about, was that when I would go into the camp I would never
                    stay overnight. I would always go in with a representative of the government of
                    Guyana, and I would always go in with Guyanese government transportation, not
                    that they had a lot, they didn't. But what they had they loaned me. I always
                    made it a point when I talked to these people to make sure I checked their
                    passports independently, and when I talked to them, I always talked well away
                    from any outside interference on the part of Temple members. This was to allow
                    the person that was talking to me to speak without fear of intimidation or being
                    overheard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This again goes back to the word you used before,
                        “privacy” and my question about support from the Department, what kind of
                        advice were you getting on how to work with sort of a middle-ground on
                        privacy versus what turned out to be a real tragedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I really didn't get much advice at all initially because, I suspect in
                    part, the Department really looked at this as just a simple protection and
                    welfare situation. But as the nature of the problem began to grow, for a while I
                    received some very good advice from Elizabeth Powers who was, at that time, in
                    Welfare and Whereabouts in the old organization before OCS/EMR, what is now the
                    Overseas Consular Services/Emergency Center. She was very good. Unfortunately
                    after she left, in the spring of '78, it then got a little chaotic because there
                    was about a four month period there when I had really no guidance at all.
                    Unfortunately, the airgram that was prepared by the Department on the Privacy
                    Act and on how to deal with this situation under the Privacy Act for some reason
                    never was sent to any of the Caribbean posts. It wasn't until a consular
                    conference was held in May of 1978 in the Department that I realized this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was nobody that sort of could pull this all
                        together for you? The right and the left hand were . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MCCOY: What happened at the Conference, Michele Truitt, who I believe at that
                    time was working for Assistant Secretary Watson, had helped draft this airgram,
                    and she came in and briefed us all on it. So after that I was able to talk to
                    her and get some specific information on how to handle this situation under the
                    Privacy Act. Fortunately, she was aware of the problems that were going on
                    relating to the Temple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically you were just using your good sense on how
                        to deal with the individual's rights and answer questions under the Privacy
                        Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: The problem you had here was the rights of privacy of an American citizen
                    as opposed to whether or not they were breaking the law. So, at that point, the
                    ambassador decided that what he would send a cable to Washington, because this
                    was a very unusual situation, requesting the Department's approval for us to go
                    to the government of Guyana with a diplomatic note asking them to please
                    investigate the situation at Jonestown with a view to making sure that no
                    American citizen's rights were being abridged by other American citizens, which
                    as you can see, is a really unusual situation. The Department came back and said
                    they saw no reason to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was presumably from the geographic bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No, this originated between CA and L/CA (Office of Legal Affairs:
                    Consular).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: The geographic bureau really played very little role in this which later
                    to their chagrin they were severely criticized for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Despite the ambassador's obvious sensitivity to it, he
                        couldn't shake up the political side of the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: He was quite irritated with his desk officer which presumably we will get
                    into, I know, later on, which is one of the reasons why the ambassador
                    recommended I go back as a desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's then get into this peak, if you will, of the
                        drama.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MCCOY: What, of course, then occurred was, I made one more trip to Jonestown. I
                    took the DCM with me at that point. Conditions in the camp in turns of the
                    physical layout had improved but I felt the good Reverend Jones was
                    deteriorating physically. But I wasn't sure what kind of role this was going to
                    play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is now maybe a year had gone by?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes, it was close to a year. I then was not able to go back. I had planned
                    a trip up there just before I was reassigned out of Georgetown back to the
                    Department. I couldn't get back up there because of bad weather. We didn't have
                    a landing site because it was muddy and wet, and you couldn't land nor could we
                    get over land from the one place where we could land because the road was
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>I left in August of 1978 to come back to the Department and at that point a U.S.
                    Congressman from California decided he wanted to visit Guyana. I was detailed to
                    brief him and his staff on conditions and what they could expect and so on. Of
                    course, what it came down to, I told him, if they went there with the press they
                    could expect a hostile reception. Now, I obviously didn't anticipate that the
                    hostility would result in them being killed, at least the Congressman being
                    killed. They asked me that specifically if the people would get violent against
                    them. And I said I really didn't know. They hadn't gotten violent toward me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had seen no real signs of violence before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No, not directed against me personally. And so the result was that I just
                    had to qualify my answer to him. I said, “But if you go, and take press with
                    you, probably what they'll do is not let you in” which is what occurred
                    initially. And then apparently Congressman Ryan who is the gentleman in question
                    was able to negotiate his way into the camp with the press. Then the situation
                    became hostile and, of course, the rest is all history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You alluded to being back in Washington now, your
                        association with the desk and so on. One, tell us more about how you got
                        that; and two, what you found yourself doing in that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MCCOY: One thing I would like to mention is when I came back on the desk, one of
                    the things I did was brief the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, Miss
                    Watson, and her staff and the Assistant Secretary for InterAmerican Affairs and
                    his staff, Ambassador Vaky, on the Temple situation. Then this evolved into
                    Congressman Ryan's visit and then, of course, we had the Jonestown tragedy which
                    occurred in November. From the Department perspective, I played a leading role
                    in putting together the briefing papers for the Secretary and then helping brief
                    the press spokesman who was at that time our Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    InterAmerican Affairs, John Bushnell. We were working together almost 24 hours a
                    day. For the first couple of weeks it was extremely intensive.I went through a
                    very difficult period. There were allegations, obviously, that came up. Why did
                    the consul or why did the embassy allow this to happen? Of course, we all know
                    why it could happen, because there's no way you can stop it, that is the mass
                    suicide and murder. Secondly, there were some allegations that Mr. Jones had
                    suborned me through the use of women which fortunately were laid to rest.</p>
                <p>Later on, of course, I was interviewed extensively by the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, the Secret Service, and by the Departments of Justice and State.
                    Fortunately, I came out of that very well. I guess which leads me to one final
                    conclusion which is when you're dealing in a situation like this and you really
                    don't have a whole lot of help, because nobody really knows what to do, then
                    you've got to follow your instincts and just do the best you can and hope. And
                    if it doesn't work out it, just doesn't work out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So while you hope for guidance you still are basically
                        dependent on your own instincts which you, in the case, developed from the
                        series of very good assignments and good bosses. At the same time, when we
                        have something as dramatic as this happen to us we'd like to think the
                        institution, maybe, profited a little bit. Was there any lessons that the
                        State Department got out of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: One of the things, of course, that has helped — and I must say one thing,
                    I received tremendous support from elements within the Department. It was
                    amazing how people came up to me and said that they were sure that things would
                    work out. Even my former non-career ambassador, Laurence Silberman, our
                    ambassador in Yugoslavia, a very prominent attorney who is now a member of the
                    U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, offered pro-bono his legal services if I
                    needed it.</p>
                <p>So, on balance, while people always seem to complain that, when officers get into
                    trouble they never get support in my particular instance that was not the case.
                    Miss Watson, the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, Miss Clark who ran MMO,
                    up through Secretary Vance, were very supportive.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I believe the Department put together a team in which we came up with lessons
                    learned and how to deal with these situations. That plus the reorganization
                    within the consular bureau into OCS to handle specific regional problems and to
                    respond more adequately to problems like this. We have seen a much greater
                    emphasis put on this, which started back with Congressman Fascell in terms of
                    his helping us develop funds for prisoners and various other forms of protection
                    and welfare issues.</p>
                <p>In my period of service in Tel Aviv, on the issue relating to whether Jerusalem
                    should be unified with Israel or remain an independent entity. I began collating
                    information, and I found out that the ambassador was particularly delighted, as
                    was the head of the political section, because as it turned out, we had very
                    little contact with Israeli students and their attitudes. Then I arranged to
                    have several other officers work with me to begin, without abridging on their
                    visa function, to discuss with them various attitudes within the course of their
                    visa interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it sort of “anything to get me off the visa
                        line?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No, not really. I enjoyed visa work. It never particularly bothered me. I
                    had spent a very tough year as a protection and welfare officer in Israel and,
                    in fact, had asked after a year to move to visas, because I can assure you I had
                    some very difficult—nothing to compare with Jonestown—but some other very, very
                    difficult protection and welfare cases in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I had one gentleman who came in to see me and wanted to know if they
                    buried people alive in Israel. He had been a Polish Jew who had been captured by
                    the Nazis, and buried alive, shot and left for dead, and still suffered mental
                    problems. We had an enormous number of mentally ill Americans in the country who
                    had come back to find God. One woman, middle aged, continually wandered out into
                    the Sinai, a couple of times was found in the middle of mine fields by Israeli
                    Army patrols.</p>
                <p>So over a period of a year, this was a fairly wearying experience, because it was
                    not only just work days, it was nights and weekends. As you can imagine, a large
                    number of people travel to Israel, regardless of their religious affiliation. We
                    had a very heavy workload, and I was the only protection and welfare
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since today the world knows the battle between the
                        Palestinian and the Israeli, it's on the front page in every paper, did that
                        involve you? Did you find yourself protecting American Arabs, for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MCCOY: In some cases, yes. Most of them were handled by the consulate in
                    Jerusalem, but we did handle those who were from the Gaza Strip. This was a
                    particular problem. The other problem we had was the forced induction of
                    American Jewish people into the Israeli Army, and then once they were inducted,
                    they were forbidden to visit the embassies. We had some interesting problems
                    with the Israelis over this issue.</p>
                <p>This was at the time when there were a number of hallmark citizenship cases
                    relating to voting and to serving in the Army. It was particularly because the
                    Israeli Government and the way they acted on the law of return and how they
                    implemented the law of return for American Jews. Initially, when a person voted,
                    they lost their citizenship. It was considered an act of allegiance to a foreign
                    country. It was taken to the Supreme Court, and the plaintiff won.</p>
                <p>So consequently, as a citizenship and protection and welfare officer, I had to go
                    through literally hundreds of cases dealing with people in this area, as well as
                    protection and welfare. So after a year, I was ready to go to the visa unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These examples you are giving in protection and welfare,
                        and I'm sure visas was the same, were coupled with those that I had in
                        Beirut about that same time, which reminds me—and I ask for your comment—how
                        closely tied the consular function is in an area like that with political
                        realities and political function, if you will, of the entire mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: That's true. That report that I did was very well received except by my
                    consul general. He got very irritated with it. He thought that I wasn't doing my
                    job; I was “wasting my time” doing things which were not my job. I, of course,
                    disagreed with him. He was an officer who believed that the consular function
                    was the consular function and not a political function, and never the twain
                    shall meet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I disagreed with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beyond disagreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I basically dealt with it on the basis that I felt that many times we did
                    get biographic and other information through the visa interview and our travels
                    in our consular function, and therefore I felt that as a Foreign Service
                    officer, I was obligated to work on this. He had been an old-line staff officer
                    who had never done anything but consular, primarily visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does “old-line staff” mean, for those who might not
                        have heard about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Basically, there were a large number of people who had come into the
                    Foreign Service right in the post-war years, who started as clerks, and when
                    that function was abolished, as a consular clerk or passport clerk, adjudicating
                    passport and visa cases. Our workload in those days, from what I could see when
                    I arrived in the '60s—and you know better than I do about this, Bill—was labor
                    intensive. You had to have all these documents, and it was very much involved on
                    citizenship. Of course, this was an outgrowth of the displaced persons that came
                    out of the Second World War, and also the requirements of the McCarran Act for
                    visas, in which you had to have everybody fingerprinted. We went through a very
                    bureaucratic exercise. We had people who were required to adjudicate these
                    cases, and who were very fine and very conscientious about it, but who believed
                    that that was all they were supposed to do.</p>
                <p>It was an attitudinal problem in the sense that they also resented the fact that
                    in those days, many officers within the embassy looked down upon them as simply
                    glorified clerks who were not really capable of doing substantive work. I
                    remember one of my bosses in Costa Rica, the second boss I had in Costa Rica in
                    the consular section, who was a man who was almost selected out as a political
                    officer, and they told him he could stay on if he went into the consular
                    cone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like consular work is second class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: It was, very definitely. People told me that if I ever expected to have a
                    successful career, I should leave the consular function and should have gone to
                    the political cone, because at that time it had always been put in my efficiency
                    report that I had reporting skills. But I felt that I really had the best of
                    both worlds, because I really did enjoy the consular function, and I believed
                    that if I did the job properly, I would be recognized for it. I think that's
                    been borne out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hopefully, just for history, hopefully today this is not a
                        reality, but how did the large mission of Tel Aviv handle a technician as
                        the consul general and some younger or at least more junior officers that
                        didn't look at their work that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MCCOY: It became rather embarrassing, because the consul general tended to get
                    pushed aside. I found myself, and some of the other officers would find
                    themselves, constantly pulled out of the section, being used as control officers
                    for congressional delegations. When we had the Black September fight between the
                    Jordanians and Palestinians in September 1970, we were literally working 24
                    hours a day. We'd work during the day in the visa unit, then we'd all pull
                    shifts commanding the operations center that we had in order to maintain a voice
                    link with our embassy in Amman, which was under direct attack by Palestinian
                    forces, and also helping to provide communications and support to the military
                    airlift that was going on at the time into Jordan. We also had the Sixth Fleet
                    that came in, and our officers were involved in coordinating with the
                    Israelis.</p>
                <p>I literally, one time, thought the Third World War was starting. I mean, it was
                    an interesting period and dramatic, but also very scary. One night, in 30
                    minutes of traffic, I had 24 immediates and six flash messages, three of which
                    were directly from the President to the Charg� of the embassy, because we
                    thought the Syrians were going to invade Jordan to assist the Palestinians, and
                    the Israelis had said if they did that, they would invade Syria. And so on and
                    so forth. So this got to be very tense.</p>
                <p>As I say, the consular officers were the backbone of the support, because there
                    were a number of junior officers in the embassy, but for example, the junior
                    officer in the political section was off doing other things, the junior officer
                    in the economic section, who was Wat Cluverius, who has had a marvelous career
                    and is a marvelous officer, was responsible for providing relief assistance to
                    Jordanian and Palestinian refugees by leading convoys from the Gaza Strip across
                    into Jordan. So consequently, what you had was, I think there was one junior
                    officer in the admin section plus the consular section, who provided the support
                    for the embassy to run the operation's center during this crisis, which lasted
                    about three weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Middle East is a good place to serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Oh, yes, it's very interesting. Never dull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's come home now after all these exciting and
                        challenging and certainly interesting assignments overseas. You did have
                        some assignment at least in language training in Washington. But now you're
                        coming home for good. You're going to go to the Central American desk job,
                        you're going to move on as Special Assistant to Diego Asencio, first Barbara
                        Watson, and finally to be the guru of the consular function, the career
                        counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Let's start with your function as a special assistant to, first, Barbara Watson,
                    then Diego. That took up a total of three years. Where would you like to start
                    on that? What we're really interested in is your views of those leaders and what
                    it was like to see a huge bureau being administered.</p>
                <p>MCCOY: I truly admired Miss Watson. She had literally gone to great lengths to
                    support me during the time that the Jonestown tragedy occurred. I was under very
                    heavy attack by members of the media, initially members of Congress, and people
                    in the Department itself because of purported allegations made against me in
                    terms of my performance prior to the Jonestown tragedy.</p>
                <p>So consequently, I found her a lady of great dignity and of great compassion, and
                    also of dedication to the consular function. She was aware essentially of what I
                    had done during my tenure in Georgetown, and she knew that obviously you can
                    always do better, but that within the constraints of what I had done, she felt I
                    had done a very good job. Therefore, she was very supportive.</p>
                <p>So when I found out that the position of special assistant was opening up that
                    year, I went to her and asked her if I could bid for it, and would I be
                    considered. She was, fortunately, delighted that I wished to work for her, and
                    so that, of course, became a happy event until I found out that she was leaving
                    to go to Malaysia as ambassador.</p>
                <p>I have to say something here. I almost didn't go as special assistant when I
                    heard that!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't blame you!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Coincidentally, at the same time I was called by folks in eastern Europe,
                    and they wanted me to go to Warsaw as a consul general, because the current
                    officer had had a serious medical problem and they had to evacuate him and his
                    family immediately. So consequently, I went up to her to talk about it, and I
                    said, “The new man coming in may decide he wants somebody else as special
                    assistant.” I had this opportunity, and Warsaw was always a dream post, and what
                    about this. She told me who the next man was going to be, and I had known him,
                    not well, but I had known him and he knew me, and she said that she had strongly
                    recommended me, and he would be delighted if I would stay on. So I felt that
                    under the circumstances, I should do that, so I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were transitional, to use a contemporary term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes, I sure was. So I did have the opportunity. But I was sad. I mean, I
                    would have loved to have spent more time with Miss Watson.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave, tell us what you felt from your vantage
                        point in just those three months in that special job you were in. What did
                        you see that she fought with or battled with? What was the word she used all
                        the time? Oiled? Put honey on? What is it that she had, and how did she do
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: She had enormous personal prestige, from what I could see. She was well
                    and favorably known up on the Hill and within the Department up to a point.
                    Certainly, she had an excellent relationship with the Secretary and with the
                    Under Secretary for Management, Ben Read. So she used that influence and her own
                    status as a woman of stature within not only the Black American community, but
                    certainly within the American community at large, to develop and to support the
                    consular function.</p>
                <p>The areas that she was mostly concerned about and was developing were the
                    consular assistance teams, CAT teams, they used to call them. They would go out
                    when we had a specific problem or where she felt that there were some very
                    serious shortcomings in the management of consular sections abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That people didn't know how to run things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: This was in 1980, and we were still having some problems between officers
                    from the old school, as I've mentioned previously, in the consular function, and
                    the new officers, very bright, dedicated junior officers, and by this time
                    mid-level officers, who were every bit as competent and good as their other
                    Foreign Service colleagues. But unfortunately, many of the old-line officers
                    were still running sections. We had some very serious management problems over
                    roles, as to what was the proper role of a consular section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like you alluded to in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Like I alluded to in Tel Aviv, yes. Also there were issues relating to the
                    new Immigration Reform Act, which was taking shape in the Congress at that time,
                    which later became the Immigration Reform Act of 1986. That was an issue.
                    Consular automation was another area that she was very interested in and
                    concerned about. Of course, the consular packet, which was constantly being
                    refined, that we were using overseas in terms of justifying workloads. Workloads
                    were taking off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, contemporary management skills that we
                        didn't have then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MCCOY: Basically, that's true. She was most concerned about that, particularly
                    about the future of the consular function because of the exploding workloads
                    that were occurring, particularly in Latin America and in the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did she do all those issues with the rest of the
                        Department? That costs money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: She did reasonably well in that regard because she had the great support
                    of Dante Fascell from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't talked about Congress, have we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No, we sure haven't, but we'll get into that. And some other people like
                    him. He comes to mind most importantly, because, after all, he was the one who
                    helped implement most of the current packages we have, like food for prisoners
                    and providing visitations to prisoners, and providing additional funds to help
                    American citizens abroad. When I was overseas for the most time, if the families
                    didn't provide prisoners food, as you know, it usually came out of our
                    pockets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Dante responsible for this, or was Barbara encouraging
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I think it was an outgrowth of a number of things. Obviously we had some
                    very serious scandals involving some American prisoners in places like Thailand,
                    Peru and Mexico. At that time, we were also getting this large explosion in the
                    number of Americans caught for drug offenses. So there was obviously an urgent
                    need to do something. So there was a very close consultation between Congressman
                    Fascell's staff and Miss Watson and her staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Fascell's role then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: He was the Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations. Q:
                    The whole international, not just consular?</p>
                <p>MCCOY: No, all international operations. Because of his constituency, which was
                    in Miami, he was very concerned about the consular function. I must say he was
                    extremely supportive and very helpful. I think in some ways he was a lot more
                    helpful than some of our own Department colleagues, including some of our
                    consular colleagues, in understanding the need to do something. Miss Watson
                    certainly understood. I'm not sure many members of the bureau understood.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did she do about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: From my limited perspective of the time . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were her right arm!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: For the three months. She, of course, was constantly prodding people to
                    come up with responses needed to implement and put these things into a form so
                    that legislation could be enacted, and also the reorganization to make the
                    Office of Overseas Citizens Services, so that we would have a much more
                    responsive bureaucracy, if you will, or office, to support American-citizen
                    problems, particularly those cases involving the deaths of American citizens,
                    missing American citizens, and American prisoners. That was the big issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she knock a few heads together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I'm not so sure I'd say she knocked heads together. I think what she hoped
                    was that this reorganization, and with the support from the Hill, things would
                    be implemented. I'm not saying she couldn't be ruthless. I, in my time with her,
                    did not see her actually knock heads together, as you would put it, but she
                    certainly had a way of dealing with those people. In other words, if they
                    couldn't be removed from the position, she just worked around them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move then from this feeling of Barbara's last three
                        months with you, to the new head of Consular Affairs. How did Diego Asencio
                        pick up from Barbara, and how did he take some of these things? Was he
                        enthusiastic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: He was a totally different person. Where Miss Watson could be very quiet
                    and very serene, Diego was very active, energetic, aggressive, ideas coming out
                    all the time, a true political animal. When I say that, this man was a political
                    officer's political officer. He dealt in policy. He was struck by the fact that
                    apart from [the fact that] Miss Watson had a lot of initiatives going when she
                    left, there was still a lot of resistance to them within the bureaucracy of
                    consular affairs, which, to be very honest, was very reactive, very passive, and
                    certainly not in a policy formulation mode at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was protective? Maybe people were afraid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Frankly, I don't know what they were afraid of. Q: Something new?</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MCCOY: Well, that, obviously, and not knowing how to deal with someone like Diego
                    Asencio. We must not forget, also, that the Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    was a Mr. Robert Fritts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came in at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: He came in about the same time I did, so he had about three and a half
                    months with Miss Watson, then Diego. Bob Fritts was an economic officer and had
                    very little knowledge of the consular function, but one thing he understood, he
                    understood management, he understood goal setting, he understood priorities, and
                    he understood how that building worked. By that I mean the Department of State.
                    I'm sure we had very few people in the consular bureau who either understood or
                    cared how the building worked and how to get problems resolved outside of their
                    own consular milieu and their own little contacts on the Hill.</p>
                <p>The result is that Diego really shook the place up. I think Miss Watson would
                    have if she'd stayed, but there's no doubt that Diego in many ways did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Bob Fritts's help.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Bob Fritts and I were the hatchet people. We were the bad-news people. In
                    other words, what I mean by that is that my mode as Diego's special assistant,
                    as he said, I had only one job requirement in that whole three years, and that
                    was to keep him out of jail. That's all he told me. As long as I kept him out of
                    jail, he was fine. So that meant that every piece of paper that came to that
                    front office, I looked at. I never changed people's drafts, because I don't
                    think that's right, because I'm not the drafter. However, I always reserve the
                    right to send notes in over the drafts or the finished product. Bob Fritts did
                    the same thing. We found that the bureau was not at all active.</p>
                <p>I have to go back, if you will give me a moment here. In my previous job, I'd
                    been a desk officer for the Southern Caribbean. I had a very active two years as
                    desk officer. I know you want to get into this later, but I think it's important
                    to set the stage. One of the things I learned was how to formulate and implement
                    policy, including where I was almost one on one with the Secretary of State on
                    two occasions. Unfortunately, because I was the only one who knew anything about
                    it, and that was the case when we had a revolution in Suriname, and nobody knew
                    anything about Suriname or cared until it happened. Then suddenly everybody
                    needed to know, and the result was that I and one other person literally put
                    together our policy that related to Suriname.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So when I took this job, I at least had a knowledge of how the Department worked.
                    So one of my functions was to develop a special assistant network throughout the
                    Department, people like Arnie Raphel, Tony Gillespie, and Gary Matthews.
                    Unfortunately, one is deceased, one is retired, one is our ambassador to Chile.
                    People like that, plus Jerry Bremer and others, who worked up on the seventh
                    floor. I went to those bureaus that I felt interacted the most with us, like
                    ARA, EUR, EAP, NEA, where we had most of the major policy issues. Then also
                    dealing with HA and RP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is from CA, you're talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Right. From CA. These are the people that I would work mostly with, the
                    line people up in the Secretariat, because one of the things people in CA, even
                    still in 1980 and '81 were not used to, when you needed to do a memorandum for a
                    seventh-floor principal, you needed it now. Nobody was interested in excuses or,
                    “I've got to go home at 5:00,” or, “I can't do this because the visa law says
                    this.” That's not acceptable. You have to do it. Many times I found myself
                    having to write the response for one of the directorates, which I didn't really
                    like doing, and they certainly didn't like, but I didn't have any choice.</p>
                <p>We had marvelous people in the bureau. We had some very talented people who, when
                    given the opportunity, performed admirably. The problem was they just weren't
                    used to it, and they just had never been challenged in that way. They had never
                    been exposed, unfortunately, to, if I may say so, some of the experiences I'd
                    had in the interfunctional area. They had always just been consular officers.
                    Not that they didn't have the ability to do anything I did; they simply never
                    had the opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying this is Diego's inspiration, Diego's change
                        of management style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: In part, I think so. He was very much empirically oriented. In fact, at
                    one point there was some suggestion that he take over RP and the asylum function
                    in HA, and certain other areas, as well. He had a lot of people worried in the
                    Department. He also had a great deal of status himself coming out of the hostage
                    situation in Colombia and as ambassador to Colombia, a successful Foreign
                    Service officer. He had outstanding relations on the Hill with Senator Simpson
                    and Congressman Fascell. Congressman Rodino, Chairman of the House Judiciary
                    Committee, was his congressman and sent his son to West Point. I mean, we had
                    contacts. We had Senator Simpson even drop in on some of our staff meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>So when we would go up for things like the Immigration and Reform Act, we were
                    playing a leading role in that. We played a leading role in changing the whole
                    attitude towards the Amerasian visa issue. Consular automation also took on
                    automation programs within the consular function such as passport automation. He
                    generated a civil service task force to meet the needs of our civil service
                    employees in CA. He began to set up through Bob Fritts a centralized anti-fraud
                    program. Bob Fritts, for example, had his goals and priorities organization,
                    where the bureau had set certain goals and priorities, and he would hold monthly
                    meetings to see how well we were meeting them. God help anybody if they weren't
                    meeting them!</p>
                <p>I can remember times when he would literally call in deputy assistant secretaries
                    within CA and tell them they were being obstructive, they were not doing their
                    job properly, they were letting some of their people mislead them, and many
                    times I would have to go give bad news in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you were the breaker of bad news. Am I hearing,
                        though, that Diego was also breaking bad news when he had to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: One of the interesting things about Diego is he is a very nice person, and
                    he just has difficulty dealing with confrontation in that context. It's not that
                    he's afraid to make decisions, but he simply did not like to hurt people or to
                    tell people they weren't doing the job properly.</p>
                <p>I can remember one issue that affected OCS. There were others that affected all
                    of them, but this was one in particular. They were supposed to provide a
                    response to Congress on conditions of prisons and whether they were meeting
                    goals and so on. It was late, and it wasn't very responsive. So we sent it back
                    down and asked them to redo it, and it came back up, and really they hadn't
                    changed it very much. I can remember standing in front of him, and it's one of
                    the few times I ever saw him really lose his temper. Of course, he yelled and
                    really gave me hell, saying he couldn't use this, and what did I expect him to
                    do with this. He literally threw the product across the desk at me and told me
                    to go down and have them fix it.</p>
                <p>So I went down, and I had to tell an unhappy deputy assistant secretary that this
                    was not acceptable, and he'd better get it straightened out or I was going to
                    have to write it, and he probably wouldn't like what I wrote. So we eventually
                    got it put forward.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We had similar problems with passports. We had a problem with passport insurance
                    in that we almost had the system collapse on us in 1982. One of the things about
                    working with Diego was that if you had to bring him bad news—and I would bring
                    him bad news—you never suffered for it. If you brought him bad news and you were
                    honest about it, and you had some ideas about how to rectify it, he didn't care
                    who you were, whether you were a class-six officer, class-one officer, whatever.
                    He would be willing to listen to you, and he really liked that. He liked people
                    who had ideas, who thought about their jobs, who were concerned about their
                    jobs, who really wanted to do a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since all of it on his side was positive, did that
                        positiveness get through to the troops, to the things that Barbara Watson
                        had started working on in terms of modernizing management? Did people begin
                        to see the light?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I think so. Particularly the mid-grade and junior officers really liked
                    it. To give you an example, we went to our first consular conference in Canada,
                    and he was just absolutely appalled because of the general nature of the
                    discussions. He was literally bored. So he came back and said, “McCoy, if you
                    don't change this, we're never going to have another consular conference again,
                    because I'm not going to sit through this again.”</p>
                <p>So we came up with a Consular Policy Management Conference, and we changed the
                    focus from worrying about whether you should issue H visas or F visas, to how we
                    should treat groups of people and how we were going to deal in a policy format
                    with the rest of the embassies, and were we getting through to the governments
                    on the issues that we needed to get through to the governments. For example, we
                    held a conference in India, and we found out that our consular people in
                    Calcutta, for example, could not call directly on their counterparts simply
                    because there was some problem within the central government. So at that point,
                    Diego, the ambassador, our consul general in Delhi, and the consular officer
                    from Calcutta went and got it solved. I mean, those are the kinds of issues that
                    he wanted to get into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have certainly illustrated that he is a political
                        animal. You also said he is a political officer's political officer. It
                        sounds to me, though, that he wasn't necessarily a consular officer's patron
                        in the sense that his impatience with talking about H visas or some of the
                        realities that you can call the nitty-gritty of the consular functions are
                        still there. How did he bring these together? Did he leave it to others? Did
                        he understand better that there is the other side to the consular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MCCOY: He understood it, but he also felt that he had people to deal with those
                    issues, that he was an Assistant Secretary of State and that he had a very
                    competent Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, and, if I may say so, a
                    reasonably competent special assistant, and people who could synthesize these
                    things for him through his deputy assistant secretaries and his office
                    directors, and present him with a package. If it made sense to him, he'd do it.
                    But he himself was not going to spend his time worrying about that, because he
                    felt that one of the problems with the consular function is that it was not
                    policy oriented. On this I agree with him wholeheartedly. By that I mean when
                    you get into issues in the Department of State, not out in an embassy, but in
                    the Department of State . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. I think you better make this distinction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes. In the Department of State, policy is formulated and implemented. Not
                    out in the field. Well, it's implemented in the field, obviously. But what I
                    mean is that the decisions are made in Washington that are going to affect
                    everybody around the world. The consular bureau had a lot of decisions that were
                    being made, that they were not part of, which impacted on them.</p>
                <p>For example, the problem of visas to lawyers to Japan was being handled totally
                    by EAP, with very little reference to CA at one point. Problems relating to
                    passport fraud issues that were coming up, in which we were not somehow
                    involved, where we should have been involved. We had problems that related to
                    the Immigration Reform Act in some of the problems in Mexico on border issues
                    that initially CA was being ignored on. Also problems of the return of the Cuban
                    marielitos, which was another issue that we had to get involved in and should
                    have been involved in very early, and we weren't.</p>
                <p>Part of that was because the consular bureau was not very effective in being
                    aggressive in defending its turf, if you will, and Diego changed that. He
                    changed it to the point where people called and said we were harassing them in
                    that sense. But on the other hand, we got people's attention. We had very strong
                    support initially from Secretary Haig, Deputy Secretary Clark, and later,
                    Secretary Shultz. They all understood the problems that existed, because every
                    time Secretary Shultz went up to the Hill to talk about our Central American
                    policy, he got hit over the head about missing journalists and murdered nuns,
                    which were consular problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what I'm hearing is that Diego, given his extreme
                        sensitivity and human qualities, was very good in the home office in
                        relating to Congress and to the establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now as a devil's advocate, I'd like to go back to the field again, where you
                    were, and say, “Gee, nobody back there understands what our problem is.” How did
                    Diego react, and how did you react to Diego's reaction to, “Nobody back there
                    understands us. They understand, the big picture, but they don't understand my H
                    visas and my lawyers.”</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MCCOY: That's a very good question. I mentioned the Delhi issue. Most of the
                    officers at New Delhi in the conference we held there in 1980 were almost
                    entirely first-tour junior officers, in small posts like Karachi, Lahore, Kabul,
                    Islamabad, Madras, and places like that. There were a few senior people. Most of
                    them were junior officers.</p>
                <p>They were faced at that time with a very serious Afghan and Iranian refugee
                    problem, and at that time we didn't have refugee coordinators or anything like
                    that out in that area. Literally, embassies, for the most part, dumped it all on
                    the consular sections, where we had, in some cases, first-tour officers.</p>
                <p>So Diego said, “What do you need from us?” Of course, they didn't know what they
                    needed. But at the same time, I suggested and Diego said, “Look, if you come
                    together and only you know what your problems are, because this is all new, you
                    come together and caucus. You tell me what you need and I'll see what I can do
                    to get it for you.” So they literally did. They got together a caucus.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, I later got feedback from them saying that was one of the most
                    marvelous times they had had in their career, because basically, what they did
                    was formulate a refugee policy for South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Diego think about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: He thought it was great. He thought it was absolutely marvelous, because
                    here people were thinking about their jobs, they were coming up with some
                    answers. They weren't sitting back waiting for the Department to give them
                    answers or decide what their fate was to be, because the Department didn't have
                    answers in that sense. We were faced with an exploding refugee area, everything
                    had been focused on Southeast Asia, and suddenly here we were in South Asia, and
                    there was very little experience. Certainly nobody in Washington had much
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's jump ahead three years to the end of his tour and
                        the end of your tour, because you parted about the same time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: He left about four months after I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there pretty much through his entire tour. In
                        retrospect, what do you think he learned out of this? What do you think he
                        gained out of it? What do you think his contributions were to the consular
                        function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MCCOY: I think what he gained out of this was a real appreciation of the
                    difficulties that the consular function faced, both in terms of its
                    relationships within the Department and in doing the job abroad. I think he was
                    very forceful in presenting this case to Congress, and I think that had it not
                    been for him, there would not have been an Immigration Reform Act.</p>
                <p>I think he worked very hard with the Senate and House staffs on this particular
                    package of legislation, and I think the other thing he did was raise the level
                    of expectations of consular officers to strive to be better. That has certainly
                    paid dividends if you look at where the consular cone is today and where it was
                    then. I can discuss that later from my experience in personnel.</p>
                <p>Diego made consular work fun. I can remember the first thing he said to me. He
                    said, “Look, we're going to have a lot of fun.” Not everything he did turned out
                    well, and not every idea he had was great. Lots of times I told him I thought he
                    was full of crap, that I felt he was just way off the track on a lot of
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would he listen to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes, I think so, by and large. Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn't. He
                    reserved the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would he hear you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Yes, definitely. That was one of the things I guess I enjoyed so much out
                    of the job, because he utilized me and my skills to the best of my advantage.
                    I'm not a creative person, but I am an operations-oriented person in the sense
                    that I can get things done and I can solve problems. I think that's been a basic
                    hallmark of my career. He utilized those skills the best, and I appreciated
                    that. He understood that. He gave me a free rein. I could literally do anything,
                    go anywhere, get involved in anything within obvious reason, without being
                    disruptive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a historical sense, as we look back over 20 years and
                        see the last three years at the top, if you will, with Diego, you have seen
                        a tremendous growth in the consular function with the establishment of
                        professional honor and so on. Is that a good summary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go on now to your next assignment. As your last
                        assignment in the Department, you brought all these very valuable
                        experiences together into the most valuable of all, in many ways, and that
                        is the senior career development officer for the consular function. You had
                        one deputy and then, of course, you had all those elements out there that
                        worked with you to make assignments and to give counseling. Let's get into
                        that area from your own words, telling us, first of all, about what the
                        function was and how you performed in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Basically, my job, along with my deputies, was to make sure that
                    assignments of middle-grade and senior consular-cone officers were made, their
                    ideas were developed, their careers were looked after, their personal problems
                    seen to, their particular assignment preferences reviewed and discussed, and, in
                    general, supported.</p>
                <p>The other thing I felt was very important was bringing to the other departments
                    or bureaus in the Department a realization that consular-cone officers were
                    truly multifaceted and talented, and that by accepting consular-cone officers,
                    they were going to get some very talented people who had a multitude of skills
                    that a lot of their political, economic, and administrative colleagues did not
                    possess. So in that regard, I had my own agenda when I went into the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it accepted by your immediate peers, your own
                        officers, the other cone officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Not exactly, because obviously I was going after jobs for my clients,
                    which is the term we used for our people that we assist, that they wanted for
                    their own officers. So there is always inherent conflict in that area, because
                    we're always competing. In many cases, two or three career-development officers
                    are going to be competing with bureaus for one job. We all may have candidates
                    for a specific job. So obviously a lot of my desires and my agenda did not
                    exactly dovetail with theirs, so there was some conflict, although I must say in
                    terms of our personal relationships, we all got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have even-handed treatment, maybe even better,
                        from your supervisors and people who had to make those hard decisions above
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: You'd have to talk to my former supervisors in that regard, but if you
                    want my own personal opinion, if I may say so . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're the only one I have.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MCCOY: Okay. I would say that I was probably successful in 90% of the cases
                    against my other colleagues, in part because I knew my clients better than they
                    knew theirs, also because I generally politicked with the bureaus beforehand,
                    using the network that I developed both as a desk officer and then later as a
                    special assistant to convince senior officers within the Department, country
                    directors and others that my candidate was clearly the best qualified. I wasn't
                    bashful about seeking assistance from Assistant Secretary Clark or other
                    assistant secretaries or higher in the Department who I happened to know
                    personally through previous assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like politics at work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Absolutely. But it's more than that. In order to be a successful career
                    development officer, you've got to be well organized, and the most important
                    thing is you've got to know your people. The way you do that, I felt, was to
                    develop career development packages on each officer who is up for reassignment.
                    Every officer who's up for reassignment, you look at his or her performance
                    folder and you talk to them personally. I probably had the largest telephone
                    bill in the entire Department of State at some point, because I was making
                    telephone calls to Singapore, Japan, Jakarta, and to posts all throughout
                    Africa, contacting my officers personally.</p>
                <p>I felt it was not only important to have what they wanted on a piece of paper,
                    which they all do, but it was more important to get their feeling about things.
                    Why did they want particular assignments? Where were their careers going? What
                    did they think of their careers? What did they really want to do?</p>
                <p>It's interesting. I mentioned previously that when Diego and I first got
                    together, he said we were going to have fun together, and we certainly did. I
                    have to tell you, every job that I went to in the Foreign Service, I had fun
                    with. I took a lot of different jobs in my career because those were the jobs I
                    felt offered me the most in terms of broadening experience and, most important,
                    those were jobs that I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>For example, when I left Guyana, I really wanted to be a desk officer. I felt
                    that a desk officer is the beginning and end of everything that happens in the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you think this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MCCOY: From my own experience of seeing desk officers at work and understanding,
                    more or less. I say more or less because I'd never formally had an assignment
                    within the Department, other than a training assignment. I just felt that if I
                    were going to be a successful Foreign Service officer, that it was important
                    that I experience this at the desk level. I was very fortunate that I had an
                    ambassador who supported me strongly. When I left Georgetown, I went back as
                    desk officer for Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Dutch and French
                    islands in the Caribbean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it hard to get that job as a consular officer? That's
                        a rather senior political job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: At the time, it was. But as I say, I had the support of the ambassador.
                    There had been a few instances when consular-cone officers by that time were
                    beginning to get desk jobs. It wasn't totally unheard of, but it wasn't the norm
                    either. However, as I mentioned previously, consular issues loom very large in
                    the Caribbean because of immigration, illegal immigration, and the large tourist
                    trade we have in the area. So in many aspects, the consular experience is very
                    important.</p>
                <p>I was also, again, fortunate to have bosses like Ashley Hewitt and Rob Warne, who
                    were the country directors in ARA/CAR at that time. They were very supportive
                    and helpful to me because I had to learn how to operate within the department,
                    which was a world all of its own, as we both know. This was really painful, but
                    you persevere and you learn. I found out that truly, you learn how to interact
                    not only within the Department, but in almost every executive branch of the
                    government, with folks outside, with just the general American public, with
                    industry, with the Hill. It was a marvelous experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taking this experience back to your personnel job, these
                        are the kinds of jobs in the Department that you were fighting to get
                        consular officers into? Or were you fighting to get them into consular
                        jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Basically, I set a goal to myself. Everybody was so worried when I went
                    into the job because there were becoming fewer and fewer consular jobs and more
                    and more consular-cone officers. We had a real imbalance at the 3, 2, and 1
                    level. It may seem strange to say that, but there were. You might have as many
                    as forty 01 officers up for reassignment, and there may be 16 consular jobs. But
                    my goal had been, for example, that I was going to place at least 50% of all
                    consular-cone officers in interfunctional jobs. That was my goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interfunctional means desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MCCOY: It means desk jobs, what we call international relations jobs, for
                    examples, in bureaus like HA, RP, MCT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Special assistants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Special assistants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they acceptable consular officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: As it turned out, I was quite successful in placing many officers. For
                    example, in PER/FCA, when I left, I think more than half of the officers were
                    consular-cone officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds to me as if you had a simple mathematical
                        problem, too, because you had so many excess consular officers and no
                        positions to put them into. The system had to place them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: That's true. When I first arrived, we did have a number of officers over
                    complement, whom I was able, for the most part, to move off over complement and
                    put in regular jobs. But again, it was the attitude that I felt, in looking in
                    the backgrounds of what I could see was becoming a very strong consular cone, if
                    you will, because these officers in the '84 to '86 time frame, the officers I
                    was dealing with, were officers who had come in basically since, let's say,
                    1970, with some exceptions. All these officers, again with some exceptions, the
                    more senior officers, probably 80% of them had come in through the examination
                    route. So they were clearly intellectually as competent as their political,
                    economic, and administrative colleagues.</p>
                <p>What I found, much to my great surprise and delight, was that the regional
                    bureaus, as well as the functional bureaus, were absolutely delighted to get
                    recommendations for officers, because a number of the bureaus like IO, OES, RP,
                    HA, their positions were always underbid. Now, admittedly, some of them should
                    have been underbid, but there were a lot of them that were very interesting,
                    like Director of the Office of Asylum Affairs in HA, which got a recent officer
                    promoted to the senior Foreign Service; a number of positions in OES which dealt
                    with some very interesting problems, polar issues and the environment and areas
                    like that, in which some consular officers had some very strong credentials; and
                    science and technology, in which, surprisingly enough, a number of consular-cone
                    officers have a background. Not just desk jobs, although we were successful in
                    getting desk jobs for consular-cone officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the examples, the realities of what you did as
                        the guru to place people, but it's a step away from what you were talking
                        about before, which is fundamental to this and so dear to the hearts of
                        every junior officer, and that is career development. That is to say,
                        “What's ahead for me? How can I grow? How can I get promoted? How can I get
                        to the top? How can I get power?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In that regard, how did you plan a person's future other than the immediate next
                    assignment and get him placed? How did you look to a career development program
                    for the officers?</p>
                <p>MCCOY: As I mentioned earlier, I did a profile on everyone. I did a number of
                    other things, too. One of the things I did, I always lectured at the A100 class,
                    not at the con general class, but at the A100 class. I talked to all of them
                    about the consular function and the importance that the consular function had in
                    relationship with the rest of the Foreign Service, and gave a number of
                    examples. I discussed with them the career, how they ought to look at their
                    careers, how to pay attention to their careers in terms of developing them.</p>
                <p>For example, taking the skills that they knew, the skills that they brought with
                    them in developing their expertise. Because it's axiomatic: you do well in a
                    job, you get a good reputation, you get good efficiency reports, you get
                    promoted. That's basically the bottom line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not everybody understands that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I agree with you, but it was very important for me to develop this sense
                    of responsibility within the individual officer. Most officers say, “I want to
                    do this. I want to do that.” That's true. A lot of consular-cone officers all
                    want to be principal officers, they all think they're great managers, and they
                    all think they're great supervisors. We both know that's not true.</p>
                <p>The other problem is to understand expectations and be able to understand
                    limitations. That's very important. Officers, also at the same time
                    understanding their strengths, also have to understand their weaknesses. If you
                    can look through a package of an officer and determine that, for example, they
                    don't write well, then you don't want him being a desk officer. At the same
                    time, he or she may have other skills, language skills or others, he or she may
                    be able to motivate people well. So then maybe you put them in a personnel job
                    or others. Admittedly, we're getting back to assignments.</p>
                <p>In career development, you look at a person's assignment history, you talk to him
                    or her, make them think about what he or she wants to do. That's very important.
                    Where do they think they're going to be ten years from now? What jobs do they
                    think are going to get them there?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I would then take my experience and say, “All right, if you want to get ahead,
                    these are the kind of jobs. You should have at least one or two interfunctional
                    jobs. You should at some point be a consular section chief. You might aspire to
                    be a principal officer.” The only unfortunate fact is we keep continually
                    closing posts, so this limits the opportunity for officers to do that, although
                    frankly, at the 01 level and above, being a principal officer I don't think,
                    except in a few cases, is really that much of a career-enhancing position
                    anymore. That's, again, a personal choice. So when you get to the 01 level,
                    you've got to be competitive to compete for the senior Foreign Service, if that
                    is your goal.</p>
                <p>There are a number of officers who, realistically, are never going to be
                    competitive for the senior Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you break that news to them? How did you work with
                        people like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Basically, my point to them was that in some cases it wasn't from lack of
                    ability; it was simply that they never took the tough jobs. They never took the
                    jobs in Lagos or, if you will, Georgetown, coming back to Washington and trying
                    to take an international relations job, whether it's a desk job or not. They
                    wouldn't do that. So consequently, when they would start to compete, they were
                    at a decided disadvantage. I would lay that out, particularly to the 3s and the
                    2s and some of the 1s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could they accept it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Most would. There were a few who wouldn't. They simply wouldn't understand
                    it. That's when I'd get back to personal experience. I'd show them my own career
                    pattern, and then I'd show them those of other officers who were successful. One
                    of the things that I always pointed out to them, I always debriefed the
                    selection boards, particularly those from 01 to OC. In three years running, plus
                    debriefing of all the inspectors I had done as a special assistant up in CA, and
                    again all the briefings and debriefings for inspectors in PER, putting all of
                    that together, I was able to convince officers that what I was saying was
                    accurate, because nine out of ten times it was proven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taking your experience in places like PER and other
                        elements that go into the realities of a successful career, did you sit down
                        with the officers, with their individual files, like a drafting officer's
                        boss who goes over and shows the realities of that file?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MCCOY: Wherever that was possible, I did that. Obviously, for officers who were
                    some distance overseas (it was also unfortunate that travel funds were so
                    limited that I never had a chance to travel in the job, which was probably
                    considered my biggest failure), it was difficult to convince those people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in two years, you or your deputy could, in principle,
                        see every officer almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I think so. I can't think of any officer that either she or I did not at
                    some point talk to personally. One year it was Terry Kleinkoff; the second year
                    it was Gwen Caronway. Terry, when I took over, and later Gwen, when she came in
                    to work with me, I pointed out that that was something I wanted them to do. I
                    wanted them to make personal contact, if overseas, by telephone, to every one of
                    the officers that was up for reassignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get others in the network to help you with this,
                        such as the officers' bosses, the posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: In some cases, but that's easier said than done, because the only time I
                    really would do that is if for some reason I was having difficulty getting the
                    officer to understand what it is that they had to do for themselves, as well as
                    what I could do for them. In a few cases I would call the DCM, or in a couple of
                    cases I'd call the head of the section, depending on the circumstances, and say,
                    “You ought to go talk to so and so, because I don't think they really understand
                    what's happening. They haven't bid realistically, and they haven't really come
                    to grips with what it is they want to do with their career.” To me that's the
                    DCM function. That's not a chief of section function; that's a DCM function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a DCM might be a manager in your terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: A DCM is a manager, no doubt about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought he was a political officer that grew up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I don't want to digress on this, but we both know that, unfortunately, the
                    failure rate of DCMs—and I must say even with consular-cone officers, as well as
                    political officers—is simply because they don't understand the difference
                    between supervising and managing, and they don't understand what the total role
                    is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MCCOY: Managers have to understand what the total program is. You look at an
                    embassy or a section, you have to understand how you're going to manage all
                    elements within both the mission and/or the section, to make sure the place
                    operates, functions smoothly and efficiently.I found that to be very true in
                    running little posts like Adana and running a reasonably good-sized level-three
                    embassy like Georgetown. You really have to understand. You also have to
                    understand what the functions are of each section, and you have to understand
                    how to make them work together so that their reports are done on time. Sure, you
                    have to know what's going on in the country, so that when the ambassador's not
                    there, you have to be able to look at political reporting and know that this is
                    accurate and properly drafted. That's all part of it, but first and foremost,
                    you are a program manager.</p>
                <p>The section chief is a program manager. So many times in the consular function,
                    section chiefs think they're still supervisors. In other words, they're
                    supervising a few FSNs and junior officers and making sure visas get out. They
                    don't understand the total picture.</p>
                <p>This comes through very clearly for inspections. It's interesting how easy it is
                    to find out who the good managers are and who aren't. It was so clear to me from
                    the job I had as special assistant, because one of the functions that Diego
                    expected of me was to be his headhunter for senior officers and also for
                    recommendations as to who would run the primary sections abroad and to fill the
                    basic important positions within the bureau, and who to support for positions
                    outside of the bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back now to the career development of the individual. So
                        much, it seems—maybe more in recent years, I don't know—is based on lore,
                        what kind of assignments to have and what I need to do to punch my ticket,
                        and that sort of thing. Some of this seems to relate to the tremendous
                        pressures today because of the selection-out issues, as well as when you bid
                        on the job.</hi>

                <p>MCCOY: The bidding of the jobs, and also because, particularly if you're a
                    class-one officer, the six-year window.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it seems that this is all tied together, and the poor
                        officer now no longer has control, from his standpoint, of his future. He's
                        completely dependent upon a bid system that he maybe doesn't understand. Do
                        you want to comment on this new bidding system and where we are today, and
                        particularly as consular officers see themselves?</hi>

                <p>MCCOY: By putting together a career development package and in talking to
                    officers, one of the things I hoped to do was to give them some ideas about
                    bidding on jobs that they would have never thought of in the past, which would
                    help their careers, particularly in the interfunctional area. Most consular
                    officers, by the time they've finished their second tour, they have a pretty
                    good idea of the consular function, depending on where they've been. Therefore,
                    the consular jobs are no mystery to them.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of officers who, for various reasons, will want to go to a
                    particular geographic area, which has absolutely nothing to do with the job, but
                    for family reasons or personal reasons, or maybe simply because they've been in
                    a hell hole like Guayaquil for a couple of years and they just want to go to
                    London, even though in terms of a career move, they're really ready to be a
                    section chief, but in fact, they're lucky if they're even going to be a unit
                    chief. But they just want to get back to some civilization and go to London.
                    That's fine.</p>
                <p>My job was to discuss it with them and say, “Where do you think you're going to
                    have fun? Where do you think you're going to be most happy?” Because a happy
                    officer is a productive officer. That's basic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someone who is having fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: Absolutely. You find out which post people have fun and which posts
                    aren't, and generally those that are not are those that are badly managed. I
                    used to talk to the junior officers at the A100 class. About 98% of them were
                    going to consular jobs right out of the A100 class, as we both know. I would
                    make no bones about going down the list and saying, “You're going to have a good
                    time because of thus and so,” or, “Good luck.” So on and so forth. I often
                    wonder when they got out there, some people may not like my comment, but the
                    point is well taken, in that if the positions are not well managed, then the
                    future of the Foreign Service suffers severely, because so many times you may
                    have God knows how many really bright, great officers lost to the Service
                    because of a lousy manager.</p>
                <p>Consequently, there have been a few cases where I deliberately would not assign
                    officers into jobs where I knew they did a poor job of supervising or managing
                    in their current or past assignment, and I would make sure if they went to
                    another job, it was not a job where they supervised anybody. Some of them
                    complained about it, and I was pretty blunt with them on a few occasions,
                    saying, “You've got to understand what you're doing, and you haven't learned
                    what you're doing. You've got these problems, and these problems have surfaced
                    at your post and section. How are you going to learn how to deal with them if
                    you don't understand yourself and your role?”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what I'm hearing, among other things, Dick, is you've
                        got to break some bad news, even when you're in personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: I'm sure there are some people, if you mentioned my name to them right
                    now, they'd spit on the floor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We don't want to end with that! (Laughs) You have given a
                        lot of your time, Dick. Are there any summary remarks about that last job or
                        anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: What I would like to leave people with, though, is the fact that I think
                    the consular cone is in the best shape it's ever been in its life. I think that
                    the officers that it was my pleasure to work with in the last eight years of my
                    career at the class 3, 2, and 1 level, are absolutely as good or better than any
                    of the officers of other cones.</p>
                <p>I can remember a comment made by the head of the Junior Officer Division, who is
                    not a consular-cone officer. In a staff meeting at PER one day, he looked around
                    at everybody and said, “To all you other CDOs, this message is meant. I'm
                    telling you right now the junior consular-cone officers are the brightest, most
                    highly motivated, most competitive group of officers it is my pleasure to deal
                    with.” And he was in the job the same two years that I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we should end on that, Dick. I thank you very
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MCCOY: You're welcome.</p>
