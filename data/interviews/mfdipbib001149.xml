                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 5, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 5, 1993 and this is an interview with G.
                        Harvey Summ on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. To begin with, I wonder if you could tell me a
                        little about yourself—when, where you were born and educated, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I grew up in New York City as a first generation American. My parents were
                    both immigrants. I was working for an export firm dealing with Latin America in
                    New York when World War II broke out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I went to the City College of New York and got my degree in business
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of export work were you doing before the
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: It was an advertising company which solicited advertising from US firms to
                    be placed in Latin American publications. I dealt with several Spanish American
                    countries as well as Brazil. To help me in the job, I decided to learn Spanish
                    and Portuguese, which I did. I went to a Berlitz type school located nearby. I
                    reawakened in the process something I had loved back in high school, learning
                    languages. I started to study Latin in high school and was entranced by it.</p>
                <p>I am more interested in the speaking and the understanding part of a language
                    than I am in the literature. So I went to this language school and picked up the
                    languages very fast. This was say 1939-41. On Pearl Harbor Day, a Sunday,
                    December 7, I was working for this firm. I took the next day off, Monday,
                    calling in sick and went down to Army, Navy and Air Force Intelligence to see if
                    they would have a place for me. I was 22 years old, single, and eminently
                    draftable. I remember the Navy didn't even have application forms, they were so
                    surprised by Pearl Harbor, and told me to come back in two weeks, which I did.
                    They had mimeographed application forms. I filled one out and about two months
                    later I was accepted.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was taken into Naval intelligence where, since I had stenographic skills, I
                    worked as a secretary for a couple of years. Then an opportunity came up to go
                    to Lisbon with an assistant Naval Attach� who was stationed at those same
                    intelligence headquarters and was being transferred. I presented my background
                    to him, including my language skills, and he arranged for me to go there. I was
                    a yeoman second class at the time, and eventually became chief yeoman, office
                    manager, of the Office of the Naval Attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Naval Attach� doing in Lisbon? It must have
                        been quite a busy time during the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: It was known as a nest of intrigue, Portugal being a neutral place. In fact
                    I remember going to night clubs and having Germans and Japanese sitting at the
                    next table. I used to walk to work from this boarding house in which I lived. I
                    walked down one side of the street and the people going to the German Legation
                    would be walking down the other side of the street and we would pretend not to
                    notice each other.</p>
                <p>The nature of the work. We kept track of Axis ships with the cooperation of the
                    Portuguese. One of the people in our mission was Theodore Rousseau, who later
                    became a curator at the Metropolitan Museum. I think he was OSS, although I
                    don't know that for sure. It was a nest of intrigue. A lot of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you got out in 1946, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I went back to Lisbon in a civilian capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Lisbon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I was office manager. I was discharged in 1946 and not sure what I wanted
                    to do with my life, I went back and took back the same job as a civilian.</p>
                <p>While in the States, in between these two assignments, I took the Foreign Service
                    exam and passed. It was Lisbon that sold me on the idea of joining the Navy and
                    seeing the world. I took the written in a naval hospital in Long Island while
                    recovering from an operation. I took the oral part of the exam with a traveling
                    panel which went through Europe and the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember they did do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SUMM: Well I flew from Lisbon to Paris and waited a month there because they were
                    delayed. That was hard duty. I liked the oral part of the exam but I remember
                    one particular thing that happened. Ambassador Gerald Drew was on the panel. He
                    was stationed in Paris at the time and joined the traveling panel. It was he who
                    asked me at the end of the exam, which went rather well, “Don't you ever get
                    your languages mixed up?” I was presenting French and Spanish as my languages. I
                    remember answering his question half in French and half in Spanish, and the
                    whole panel burst out laughing. But obviously it went well and shortly
                    thereafter I entered the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You entered in 1948?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Today is exactly 45 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today being March 5.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Let me interject at this point. Joining the Foreign Service really, as it
                    must be the case with so many other people, was a signal event in my life. As I
                    like to put it, it took me off the lower middle class ladder and put me on the
                    upper middle class ladder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any training when you came in? How did they
                        absorb you when you came into the Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Three months in a course at FSI, basically the same A100 course that is
                    given today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose most of you were veterans at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: About half I would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go first and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: The Dominican Republic was my first assignment. I had a combination of
                    jobs. I was supposed to be administrative officer. Only later did I find out
                    that administration was something that they give to counselors and that I, a
                    brand new FSO, was responsible for the administration of an embassy. I didn't do
                    all that well. I discovered I had to be an expert on roofs, gardens, and as a
                    city boy and an intellectual I didn't have much preparation for this. But the
                    Ambassador's wife demanded that her plants grow even in the dry season.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I remember having a run-in with the head of the Marine detachment there. I was
                    surprised when this sergeant began to bargain with me like a union
                    representative. My reaction was, “This is what the Marines are like?” So I don't
                    think I did all that well as an administrative officer.</p>
                <p>But I did other things. What I wanted to do was political reporting. I persuaded
                    the DCM to allow me to cover some events going on in town. I remember an
                    American journalist speaking down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation then? This was at the
                        height of the Trujillo power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: That's right. It was very tense. I became friendly with a group of people
                    who were ostensibly favorable to the regime, but in fact, after winning their
                    confidence...what I discovered was that out on the beach they would talk freely
                    in my presence about how much they hated Trujillo. Members of their families had
                    been tortured and killed. That sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude at the time in the Embassy towards
                        Trujillo and his family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: As FDR is reputed to have said, “We knew they were SOBs, but these were
                    people with whom we had to maintain at least some cordiality and went to all the
                    parties.” We knew what he was like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador then was Ralph Ackerman. Sometimes
                        ambassadors get absorbed into the ruling clique. How did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I can't really tell. I wasn't close enough to Ambassador Ackerman. Just
                    judging from things that he said in staff meetings, I gather that he was
                    somewhat more favorable to the Trujillo outlook then I would have been. But that
                    is merely an impression. Chuck Burrows, who was the DCM there, clearly saw them
                    for what they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't an Embassy that had been absorbed or attracted
                        by the Trujillos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you had Congressmen who were sort of
                        tame members of the Trujillo clique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I know what you mean, but not in my case.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say that at your level you probably
                        wouldn't have been hit with this type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Well, I might have as admin officer. I made CODEL arrangements, etc., but
                    it just never happened during my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved after a year to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Bahia, Brazil...Salvador, a consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Brazil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: That is right. Northeast Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Everything. It was a two-man consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Bahia is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Just south of the bulge that extends out toward Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is called Salvador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Interchangeably, yes. Bahia is the way I usually referred to it.</p>
                <p>I had consular, administrative, political and USIA duties. I started the USIA
                    program. The idea always attracted me. I ended up being invited to two PAO
                    conferences in Rio because of my interest in USIA work and was twice offered
                    USIA jobs in various other countries. But I turned them down because I had my
                    eye on becoming a political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation, political, economic and all in
                        Bahia at that time? We are talking about 1949-51.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SUMM: The main thing that happened was the presidential elections of 1950. In
                    them Getulio Vargas, who had been dictator of Brazil for 15 years up until World
                    War II, was now running for election in open free elections. So I was trying to
                    provide the Embassy with information on how the elections were going in our
                    consular district.</p>
                <p>I remember interviewing the candidate for governor of Bahia. I had an interesting
                    connection in Bahia that ended up playing a great role in my future life. There
                    were a group of anthropologists from Columbia University in Bahia doing
                    community studies. It occurred to me that they would be very useful contacts to
                    tell me what was going on outside the capital city. I used to get together with
                    them. The head of the group was an anthropology professor from Columbia who
                    eventually became my brother-in-law and helped launch me into an academic
                    career. We became very close friends. I was able to predict how the election
                    would go locally. I thought Vargas was going to win. Incidentally my predictions
                    were at odds with those of the Embassy, but I think I was closer to the pulse of

                        Brazil which is very hard to cover from the capital. What was your
                        impression of how the government was run at the local level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Not well. Not very efficient. I have become a Brazilianist since then and
                    have written books on the subject. They bear out my experience of over 40 years
                    ago. The approach of local officials was slovenly, that society was driven
                    between a very small elite and a large number of very poor and unwashed people.
                    The elites didn't really give a damn for those underneath them...which is still
                    much the case today.</p>
                <p>One can attribute this to the tropics or racial background. I don't, I think it
                    is a cultural trait on the part of Brazilians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One can look at this. It has always been an interesting
                        thing of wondering why so much of Latin America just hasn't been able to put
                        things together. Argentina is a prime example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: The most egregious example. But all throughout the hemisphere that is the
                    case. I think it has mainly to do with the Iberian background, it goes back as
                    far as Rome. where patron/client relationships, family ties, personal
                    involvement, sentimental attachments are all more important than efficiency and
                    getting things done.</p>
                <p>And there is something to be said for that kind of approach to life, but it does
                    not usually yield positive results in terms of development. Of course, this has
                    been a continuing frustration to Latin American countries, particularly
                    vis-a-vis the US, when they see how much we have been able to achieve in
                    development terms in a much shorter period.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SUMM: In the public affairs realm they were very supportive, as I have indicated.
                    In the political realm, with some of the political reporting I did on local
                    events, there were encouraging notes from people in the Embassy. And, of course,
                    most relevant, is the fact that the Embassy asked to have me transferred
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You transferred to Rio in 1951. So you served there until
                        1955. What were you doing in Rio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I was originally supposed to go as the junior member of the political
                    section. This was at last what I had looked forward to. But, what happened was,
                    the Ambassador's aide had just been unexpectedly transferred and I was drafted
                    for that task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador was Herschel Johnson. Could you tell us how
                        he operated and his view of Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: A lovely man. I remember an official-informal letter that he wrote back to
                    somebody in the Department talking about the fact that we would always be able
                    to depend on the Brazilians. This, I think, encapsulated his world view. At the
                    time I read it, my own view was somewhat more reserved. I foresaw that there
                    would come a time when Brazil would no longer be satisfied to be our loyal ally.
                    But at any rate that was his approach. He was well in with society. He knew all
                    the key people. He let his top officials operate effectively. I think the
                    Embassy was reasonably well informed during my period there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your vantage point how did you view the Vargas

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SUMM: I ended up being there at the time Vargas committed suicide in 1954, so I
                    was able to follow the wave of corruption that grew there, largely, I think,
                    without his knowledge. I think what happened to Vargas was...let me try to
                    distinguish between the domestic and foreign relations aspects of it. For two
                    reasons he was no longer effective in the fifties as he had been in the forties.
                    One was that he was older and two, he had to operate in a free society and was
                    subject to criticism. This I think got under his skin. Previously there had been
                    censorship. So things began to go downhill to the point where he committed
                    suicide. That is in the domestic sense.</p>
                <p>In the foreign policy sense, I think he was a pragmatist...we knew he had flirted
                    with the Axis group in World War II, but he saw that his ties with the US were
                    more important to him. Dean Acheson, Secretary of State, visited during the time
                    I was there. The visit went well and was cordial as far as we knew. So, from our
                    point of view Vargas was a reliable ally, whatever his personal views might have
                    been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Embassy? How it ran,
                        etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Let me divide this into two phases. Under Herschel Johnson I thought it
                    went splendidly. He was a fine Ambassador. Then along came James Kemper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was James Kemper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: James Kemper was a rich insurance man from the Midwest, Kemper Insurance,
                    political appointee. This had a particular relationship to me because I was the
                    Ambassador's aide. Now was I going to become Kemper's aide? A fortuitous event
                    occurred. We had an inspection and the inspector...this was in 1953 when the new
                    Eisenhower administration came in and they were looking for ways to cut...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. We went through a RIF program...reduction in
                        force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I remember the inspector talking to me and asking me how much time I spent
                    on my job as ambassador's aide. Since I was a restless sort of person, I was not
                    all that happy in that job, although I learned a great deal. I spoke honestly to
                    him and said that I felt the job could be eliminated altogether or somebody
                    could do it on a part-time basis. So, his recommendation was that the job be
                    eliminated. This ended up in my being transferred to the consular section as
                    visa officer, just as Kemper came along. I was very happy not to be part of his
                    entourage.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>He was miserable for the Embassy. He propositioned officers' wives, offering to
                    set them up in apartments. I remember a staff meeting where he invited us to
                    inform on each other. This was the McCarthy period, so if there were disloyal
                    Americans on the Embassy staff he was going to rout them out. This was revolting
                    stuff. Fortunately I was far removed for the most part from his
                    machinations.</p>
                <p>He eventually came a-cropper on his own, which is nice. While home on
                    consultation he stopped off in Boston to see a business friend. The price of
                    coffee had gone up and housewives were complaining and an interviewer asked
                    Kemper what he thought was going to happen to the price of coffee. He said that
                    it wasn't going to stay up like that, that it would come down. This was during
                    the 1954 congressional elections and he was trying to help a congressional
                    candidate who was a friend of his. Of course, when the Brazilians saw this...if
                    the Ambassador thinks the price of coffee is going to come down then he must
                    know something. This time the Brazilians protested vigorously and Kemper was
                    moved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the consular section, visas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Yes, visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I guess the only problem then was that there were Brazilians coming up by
                    the carload to buy appliances and take them back. We were overwhelmed by the
                    workload. But after all they were bona fide non-immigrants and there was no
                    reason to interfere with that. It was just a matter of keeping up with them. I
                    enjoyed the work.</p>
                <p>Oh, there was one security problem. A prominent Brazilian novelist I had heard
                    was going to apply for a visa and I came up with some derogatory information on
                    him. I went to the public affairs officer and said, “Look, according to the
                    rules we are going to need a waiver for this guy. If not, I am going to have to
                    turn him down.” I think because of the McCarthyite atmosphere prevailing there
                    the PAO was unwilling to stick his neck out and make the kind of argument that
                    would be necessary for a waiver. So I did have to turn the guy down. We got flak
                    for it. I saw the problem coming, but unfortunately couldn't do anything about
                    it.</p>

                <p>SUMM: Well, the local CIA station had picked up information from confidential
                    sources which, I think in his case said that he had signed the Stockholm Peace
                    Petition and that he had made statements favorable to organizations which were
                    on the Attorney General's Subversive List.</p>

                <p>SUMM: And given McCarthyite allegations against members of the State Department,
                    we had to make sure we were covered. You didn't go out violating instructions
                    because it might be your head. You had to follow the law to the letter.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I used to say the Department of State believed in long engagements. It took
                    a year to get permission to marry her. Not that she was any problem, but again
                    because of the McCarthy era, there were all kinds of investigations going on and
                    hers was at the bottom of the pile. But the Ambassador, Herschel Johnson, while
                    on a trip to the States inquired about the investigation, and I think that
                    helped move things along.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I was called an international administration officer, part of the Bureau of
                    IO, International Organizations. But in fact I was delegated to work with the US
                    delegation to the OAS and it was partially like a foreign assignment even while
                    being in Washington because on the average I guess I would go twice a week down
                    to the OAS...walk from my office down to 17th and Constitution ...and sit on
                    committees there with other Latin Americans, dealing primarily with budget
                    matters. I was on the budget committee of the OAS. It was a very interesting
                    experience during which I got to know more about that organization.</p>
                <p>I also served as budget officer on US delegations to other international
                    organizations, and as such went to international conferences...Caracas, Mexico,
                    others.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SUMM: Let me give you a dual impression. It was not a very efficient
                    organization. There were a lot of time servers there..people who were employed
                    because of pressure from their home governments. Castoffs or some who had been
                    involved in unsuccessful coups who had to be gotten out of the country.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I formed a view there that I have maintained ever since. No
                    matter how inefficient or ineffective the organization was, it was worthwhile
                    having on a residual basis as a peacekeeping organization. The amounts
                    involved...I think the total budget was $30 million at the time, of which the US
                    contribution was two-thirds ...were a pittance really for us to spend, to keep
                    available a peacekeeping organization that could function in case of outbreaks
                    between Latin American countries. I still maintain that.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the OAS people look upon the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Again in terms of our relationships there, it was an atypical period,
                    because the OAS was an extremely effective organization in settling disputes in
                    Central America. It was about a week after I got there that Nicaraguan exiles
                    crossed the border into Costa Rica. Costa Rica, depended on the OAS as its
                    shield, having disbanded its army, and came to the OAS. Under the leadership of
                    our Ambassador, John Dreier, an outstanding man, we acted as a fire brigade. He
                    would put on an old baseball cap and get on a plane together with Latin American
                    colleagues the day after and get down to the scene. And then they would start to
                    cool heads off. This kind of behavior continued during the time I was there and
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that I got a very rosy view of how international organization
                    could operate. It was, admittedly, a special time, operating only in a limited
                    sphere, but when one can find opportunities for peaceful settlement of disputes,
                    no matter where they are, you have to applaud that.</p>
                <p>There was another thing at work there. There were several Latin Americans, a
                    Mexican, a Uruguayan, notably, who worked in very close concert with Ambassador
                    Dreier and his staff. The way we did things was, we persuaded Latins who shared
                    our viewpoint to take the lead. We would stay in the background. It was a very
                    effective way to get US foreign policy objectives accomplished. You might say
                    the very reverse of the Kemper group. If the US tries to thrust itself to the
                    fore in dealing with Latins, we inevitably come a-cropper.</p>

                <p>SUMM: There was a democratically-elected government in, a conservative regime.
                    Ponce was president.</p>
                <p>You have asked me my impressions about various ambassadors. Ambassador Ravndal
                    was at the airport to meet me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Christian Ravndal, my God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I never expected that. He was a marvelous man. His wife, who was Austrian,
                    took my Brazilian wife in hand and was a great help to her. His views were
                    rather conservative, mine were rather liberal. But he was extremely fair in
                    letting me call shots the way I wanted to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Chief. It was a two-man political section.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your reporting how could you handle the two views? What
                        were you seeing and what was he seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SUMM: I remember Ambassador Ravndal calling me into his office one morning. He
                    had been at a dinner party the night before and some of the people in Ecuadorian
                    society had complained to him that the US by supporting agrarian reform was
                    doing something extremely radical, if not communistic. This was not directed
                    towards me personally, but I also had labor union connections and the Ambassador
                    wanted to know if this was a problem. I frankly said to him, “Mr. Ambassador, it
                    is not so much that we are supporting this, it is that this country badly needs
                    agrarian reform, it hasn't had it. Those Ecuadorians I know who support it are
                    by no means radicals. These are reformers.” And that was it. He accepted my
                    viewpoint.</p>
                <p>There was a mayoral election in Quito and much to the surprise of the Embassy a
                    populist was elected. Again the Ambassador called me into the office and asked
                    what it meant to us. I said, “Mr. Ambassador, I don't really know this fellow
                    too well, but I know some people around him. I think he really sounds more
                    radical then he in fact is going to be.” Then Chris said to me, “Well, get to
                    know him.” So, again I admired this detachment of his...whatever his personal
                    views it behooves the United States to know what is going on. He encouraged me
                    and I did get to know these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time what did you see as American interests in
                        Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Not very great. Again Ambassador Ravndal used the term “to make this a
                    showcase for democracy.” Ecuador had practically never had democracy. Here was
                    the third straight time a president had been elected. The idea would be that
                    through our AID program we would try to make them a showcase. I was very dubious
                    about this because their institutions were such that they did not indicate any
                    such thing would be possible. But I tried working with the AID mission to
                    encourage health, education, agriculture at the grass roots level.</p>
                <p>I was also labor reporting officer there. I enjoyed that. I remember getting
                    drunk with a bunch of labor leaders. I don't like to drink. We sat up in the
                    stands in an arena and they passed a whisky bottle back and forth and I took a
                    swig out of it. I remember driving home that night, fortunately without
                    accident. But it helped me gain their confidence more easily. They, too, were
                    not radical. They just wanted improvement in their lives.</p>

                <p>SUMM: There was a dustup during my period there. Our Embassy in Rio was the one
                    that had primary responsibility for this. We merely reported some of the
                    reactions of the Ecuadorian officials.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I have the most vivid memories of my whole Foreign Service career from

                </p>
                <p>SUMM: It was at the end of a two-year assignment and that was all it was expected
                    to be. It was a so-called hardship post. I came back here for the mid-career
                    course and went on to Cuba in mid-July.</p>
                <p>The period I spent in Cuba, July 19, 1960-January, 1961 was the period of the
                    highest tension between the United States and Cuba. The month that I arrived at
                    my post was the month in which US refineries were nationalized by Castro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Castro come into power when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: He had already been in power for a year and a half. All the action during
                    the revolution had taken place in Oriente Province, where Santiago was.
                    Unfortunately I missed it. The parade had passed me by. My predecessors had gone
                    up into the hills to try to negotiate the release of some Marines who had been
                    kidnaped by Raul Castro. But I was just there to observe really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SUMM: In that month of July when I arrived, the US terminated Cuba's sugar quota
                    and Cuba nationalized two US refineries. There began to be almost daily insults
                    uttered by the US and Cuban governments at each other. It was a period during
                    which Castro went to the UN General Assembly...the most exciting session it has
                    ever had, where Khrushchev banged his shoe on the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Castro had held court in a hotel in Harlem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Yes, that is right. Later on they renamed a motel in Santiago the Harlem
                    Motel because of that.</p>
                <p>I guess the most exciting event I recall was...I had driven my wife back in
                    September to Havana to evacuate her to the States. Dependents were being
                    evacuated. We spent the night with Ambassador Bonsal and his wife in the Embassy
                    residence. That was the day that Fidel returned from his trip to the UN and we
                    were watching him report to the Cuban people on television. There were five of
                    us in the Bonsal living room after dinner...the Bonsals, my wife and myself, and
                    Ambassador Bonsal's secretary. I remember that all four of us, except the
                    Ambassador, were furious at some of the lies that Castro was uttering, but not a
                    muscle moved in Ambassador Bonsal's face.</p>
                <p>I went back to my post the following day after putting my wife on the plane to
                    the States and spent another three months in Santiago during which relationships
                    continued to deteriorate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the local authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: We had very little to do with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before that our post had been mainly one because of
                        American interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Yes, and the Guantanamo Naval Base which was 40 miles away as the crow
                    flies and 80 miles by road. I went over there several times.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, the last part of my stay was when relations were broken. Now I
                    was in my residence on a Sunday night at home and I remember hearing a
                    voice...”Mr. Consul, Mr. Consul.” This was my next door neighbor. When I went to
                    the fence she said, “Castro has just told the US to reduce its Embassy to eleven
                    people. What does this mean?” I tried to calm her, but I realized immediately
                    that the US would not accept this and that this meant that deteriorating
                    circumstances were now going to come to a head and relations were going to be
                    broken.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I called the whole American staff of the Consulate, there was a total of six, and
                    we all went down to the office. I called the Embassy by CB and said that we were
                    going to start preparing to destroy documents, and would await word from them.
                    Of course they were just as surprised as we were. We secured things for the
                    night and the next morning, Monday morning, which was a holiday...it was the
                    second anniversary of Castro's coming to power...we came and started to burn
                    documents and get ready for evacuation.</p>
                <p>We sent out telegrams to all the American residents in our consular district
                    saying that we were going to lead a motorcade to Guantanamo Base for evacuation
                    and they were welcome to join us. About 40 automobiles joined us. On January 2
                    we did lead such an evacuation. We were then prepared to close up the
                    Consulate.</p>
                <p>Then what happened was the Embassy told me, “No, no, no, that wouldn't work, I
                    had to come back and wait for the Swiss as protecting power to come down and
                    take inventory.” So what I did was, we led this group out to the base and then,
                    all by myself drove back in the Consulate station wagon and remained there for
                    another ten days with nothing to do.Fortunately the landlord of our residence
                    was a Puerto Rican businessman with a Cuban wife and they had invited me to stay
                    with them, which I did. I used to play dominoes with the kids every afternoon. I
                    would drive to the Consulate, which wasn't far from there, twice every day to
                    listen to the radio and find out if anything was happening. There were no duties
                    to perform because relations had been broken. There was a militiaman outside who
                    guarded the place. We had a splendid local employee who, when the militiaman
                    tried to stop me from going in once, inserted himself between us and said, “This
                    is the American Consul and you have to allow him to go in.” Fortunately that
                    worked.</p>
                <p>I waited a total of ten days until the Swiss representative came after finishing
                    the inventory of the Embassy. I don't know how many times I took inventory, I
                    had nothing else to do. I remember the representative arrived, German Swiss and
                    very proper, he said, “No, no, no. This isn't done the way it is supposed to be
                    done.” I think I had done it room by room and according to him it had to be done
                    item by item by item. I said, “Okay, if you want us to redo it we will, but I
                    don't know how long it will take us.” I knew he wanted to get back to Havana
                    that night. He finally said, “Okay, give me the inventory the way you have done
                    it, and I will sign it.” He left that night.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The next morning, I, with this Cuban employee, drove to Guantanamo Base where the
                    orders were the vehicle was to be left there and shipped back to the States and
                    I was to stay on the base. When you pass the city of Guantanamo on your way to
                    the Base you come to a fork in the road and there at this checkpoint was a
                    militiaman...he must have been about seventeen years old...who asked for our
                    documents. I hadn't received my Cuban identity card yet. All I had was my
                    American passport. Miguel, the employee, passed our documents over to him. You
                    could see this fellow reading my passport in English and not understanding it or
                    what we were saying. He finally asked Miguel what it said. He said, “This is the
                    American Consul who is leaving and going onto Guantanamo.” He looked dubious for
                    a while but finally gave us back our documents and said, “Okay, you can go
                    ahead. Sorry for the trouble I posed.”</p>
                <p>Now this stands out in my mind because of the so-called strong antipathy of
                    Cubans for the United States. Here was a member of the militia talking to a
                    representative of the hated US government who was polite enough to say he was
                    sorry. In fact, during my whole period there, even when I no longer had duties
                    to perform, I found nothing but courtesy and kindness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have mobs demonstrating in front of the
                        Embassy? It is interesting because during, I think in the 1870s we had to
                        send in a Naval ship to yank a Consul off from Santiago...Were you aware of
                        preparations for the flight of the middle class from Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: It was well under way when I got there. Among us, the consular officers, we
                    used to comment that the very fact that all these people were fleeing was going
                    to make it impossible for there to arise leadership that would overthrow Castro.
                    That leadership was displacing itself.</p>
                <p>But, of course, because of the overwhelming US role in everything involving Cuba
                    throughout the 19th century, they always looked to the north to resolve their
                    problems. This was the way Cubans had always dealt with us. Both those who liked
                    us and those who hated us looked to us for solutions.</p>
                <p>I had a vice consul at the time who wanted to deny visas to people because these
                    were the ones who could lead the resistance to Castro. I said that we couldn't
                    do that. There were no grounds in US law for doing that.</p>
                <p>I used to have the rumor mill. One morning I had half a dozen anti-Castro Cubans
                    come in and tell me a certain rumor which had no foundation in fact. The fact
                    that I heard it from half a dozen people didn't make it any more reliable. They
                    just thought the American Consul ought to know about this.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Yes, about the Bay of Pigs. I didn't know where and when it was going to take
                    place, but my wife had told me she had seen pictures on TV in the US of Cuban
                    exiles training somewhere to overthrow Castro. It was common knowledge in Cuba
                    that such efforts were underway, they thought helped by the United States
                    clandestinely.</p>
                <p>I want to jump to the US 1961. Adolf Berle was advisor to Kennedy in the early
                    months of 1961. Through a mutual acquaintance I went to see him and I said, “I
                    gather from what I hear that the US is planning some kind of action to try to
                    dislodge Castro from Cuba through invasion.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I was coming back to the Department and will explain this in a moment, but
                    let me relate this.</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't know about the rest of Cuba, but as far as my part of the island
                    is concerned, if we think that there is sufficient opposition to Castro to try
                    and overthrow him, we are mistaken.” The particular event that had happened was
                    at a Christmas party in 1960, almost at the end of my tour, at the binational
                    center and this conversation stands out in my mind. It was a young man who had
                    been to the United States and said, “Mr. Summ, I love the United States, but I
                    am with Fidel all the way.” This was pretty much the view of the people in Cuba
                    who might be anti-Castro but who were also anti-US and surely would not risk
                    their lives to back something unless they knew the outcome with certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Berle's reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: He said, “Well, write me a memo,” which I did. It had no effect. All the
                    rest of the US role subsequently came out at the Bay of Pigs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, you left Guantanamo when and what did you do
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: It would be January 14, 1961. I was flown by Navy plane to Miami and then
                    by commercial airline up to New York, where my wife was staying. After a week's
                    leave I came down here for an assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SUMM: Well, I was to go to Nicaragua as head of the political section and I
                    didn't like the idea at all. It was a backwater and I felt that having been in
                    Ecuador and in Cuba, Nicaragua was a comedown.</p>
                <p>Then happened a career changing move that was entirely unexpected. My wife came
                    down to the Department for her physical and we had lunch. I said, “Listen, Bob
                    Stevenson, who was the Cuban Desk officer at the time, and with whom you have
                    talked on the phone often trying to find out how I was in Cuba, would you like
                    to meet him?” So I took her up to Bob's office and introduced her. Bob had very
                    nice words to say about what I had done and then much to my surprise my wife
                    piped up and said, “I am surprised at you people. How can you do this to a man
                    who has done the kind of work that my husband has that you have been so
                    complimentary about? You are going to send him to Nicaragua?”</p>
                <p>I was so embarrassed at her speaking up for me I could have fallen through the
                    floor. But interestingly enough, unknown to me, Bob knew about an opening coming
                    up in ARA and he opened his eyes wide and said, “Well, I never thought about
                    that, Mrs. Summ. I have to think about that.” Sure enough my assignment got
                    changed. I was put into the public affairs staff of ARA. I took the place of
                    somebody who they knew was leaving. And that, of course, changed the whole
                    course of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing with public affairs? This was from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: A year, the beginning of 1961 to the beginning of 1962. I was responsible
                    for the Caribbean. This meant dealing with press inquiries, preparing responses
                    for the Department at the noon briefing for questions related to what was going
                    on in the Caribbean. There were two things going on there—Cuba and the Dominican
                    Republic. In the Dominican Republic we were conspiring with opposition elements
                    to try to eliminate Trujillo. I liked the job. I have always had a yen for
                    public affairs. It was a fast-moving job. I dealt with the press a good
                    deal.</p>
                <p>Then the following year there was an opening as the Cuban Desk Officer and I
                    moved into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being Cuban Desk Officer at the very pits of our relations
                        with Cuba, was there anything much going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: In 1962? The missile crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Cuba was more or less the possessor of the
                        property, but the tenant, the Soviet Union, was doing the...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SUMM: Well, my own role in this. I was really relegated to a back seat. President
                    Kennedy became Cuban Desk Officer. In the missile crisis, itself, I was just an
                    errand boy, in effect, which was fine. Even the people over me in the Office of
                    Caribbean Affairs had various duties like that to carry out. My main duty
                    continued to be with briefing the press, briefing foreign diplomats who wanted
                    to be current.</p>
                <p>I used to take chances, as a matter of fact, in telling people things on a
                    non-attribution or non-publication basis and I never slipped. Nobody ever used
                    information that I gave them improperly. It was a matter of establishing trust
                    between the foreign diplomat or press representative with whom I dealt.</p>
                <p>I also drafted messages. A lot of what we were doing then was trying to deny
                    economic benefits to Cuba which meant participating in countless meetings where
                    we were pushing an unwilling EUR to try to get rough with its clients. They
                    would say, “Is it worth disturbing our European relationships just for this
                    useless attempt to make life difficult for Cuba?” But these were our marching
                    orders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the information we were
                        getting from Cuba at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: The Bay of Pigs. All I knew about the Bay of Pigs was what I saw in the
                    newspaper. Later on in 1962 the question of Soviet missiles in Cuba came up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Surface to Air Missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Which were relatively very small missiles.</p>
                <p>Why would the Soviets risk a standoff with the United States for what seemed like
                    a relatively unimportant client who we were not threatening to invade.</p>
                <p>But, of course, later on I found out about Operation Mongoose where the Kennedys,
                    who were trying to get revenge for the Bay of Pigs, mounted a large
                    operation.</p>
                <p>Castro, because he was afraid of what Mongoose might do, was calling upon the
                    Soviets for providing ICBMs.</p>
                <p>He wanted an opportunity to try and play catch-up in the nuclear game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a Cuban lobby at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SUMM: I dealt with Cuban exile officials here and later in Miami, who were very
                    much in our debt. They really had to beseech us to pay any attention to
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression during the Bay of Pigs thing?
                        Granted Kennedy became the Cuban Desk Officer and all, and it moved up way
                        above, but there was a certain point when we were all aware that we were
                        reaching a standoff and all, what was your impression down below? Did you
                        see the Cubans as being sort of brushed aside by both the Soviets and the
                        Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I am not basing this on any particular information I have in my official
                    capacity, but rather just a general evaluation of the situation. Yes, the US and
                    Russia tried to deal and ignore Cuba, but Castro just wouldn't permit that to
                    happen. So Khrushchev had to send Mikoyan to hold Castro's hand for a couple of
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was vice president or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Yes, an Armenian. A pretty close colleague of Khrushchev's who had been to
                    Cuba before and knew Castro.While the US-USSR negotiated, Mikoyan tried to
                    convince Castro that he would not be ignored in this whole thing. Actually, much
                    as I tend to detest much of what Castro stands for, I can't help but look upon
                    him as one of the marvels of the age. Here is this guy 30 years later still
                    around. All of his contemporaries have departed the scene and Cuba which is
                    intrinsically an island of no importance, he has been able to keep at the center
                    of the world stage all this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware or was it obvious as things went, that
                        there had been a deal that the United States would not invade Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I don't think it was that secret. We recognized that Cuba was part of the
                    Soviet Bloc and that as long as they kept to themselves and did not engage in
                    subversive activities in the hemisphere, we would not try and dislodge him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our feeling at the time? You were dealing with
                        Cuban affairs from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SUMM: Right up through 1965 and this leads me right into my next assignment
                    because in early 1963...let's see, a year in public affairs, a year as Cuban
                    Desk Officer, then I went to Miami to be Coordinator of Cuban Affairs. My main
                    function there was to prevent Cuban exiles on their own from trying to mount
                    operations which might try to bring down Castro by air or by sea. All of this
                    was based in south Florida. What we found was that in Washington we just didn't
                    know enough about what was going on down there, that the US agencies, Customs,
                    Immigration and Coast Guard, just had not experience with foreign affairs at all
                    and they were at sea as how to deal with these things. We saw how dangerous an
                    incident like this could become, so my function down there was to prevent
                    anything like this from happening.So I am answering your question by saying that
                    we recognized the existence of Communist Cuba and we were not going to allow any
                    change unless we were the ones to change that situation. We were not going to
                    allow third parties to change it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, weren't you running across the CIA efforts supported
                        by the Kennedys? Here you were down there to quiet things down but at the
                        same through the CIA they were trying to do just the opposite.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I knew what the CIA people were doing. They had an enormous station in
                    Miami. I went down there a couple of times and was briefed by their head of
                    station. I had three people working for me, while he had hundreds working for
                    him. But he was very nice about it. So the idea was that if anybody was going to
                    engage in activities to overthrow Castro, it was going to be us, or people who
                    we supported. Others, free lancers, who wanted to do this on their own had to be
                    stopped. So that was my function.</p>
                <p>It was arranged that I would not have operational control over the CIA operation
                    in Florida. That would be handled in Washington. This was done partly to give me
                    deniability, that I knew nothing about what was going on. Although no such
                    charges came up while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the Cubans? You must have had people
                        coming in saying, “Come on Mr. Summ. What are you trying to do to me?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: All the time. One of the things that happened as the result of Kennedy's
                    assassination in 1963 was that a lot of the pressure was removed. In particular,
                    shortly after Johnson became President, there was an incident off Key West, in
                    which I was involved where Cuban fishing boats were caught in US waters. I flew
                    down to Key West to deal with this problem. One of the consequences of this
                    was...Fidel said he would shut off the water to Guantanamo and Johnson
                    downplayed the whole thing and ordered the construction of a desalination plant
                    for sea water. He wanted to avoid confrontation. He did not have the personal
                    involvement in this like the Kennedys did.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So in Miami my effort essentially was to coordinate the activities of various
                    local US agencies to prevent non-US related Cubans from doing things we did not
                    want them to do. I flew with the Coast Guard Admiral over to Nassau. We had
                    lunch with the Governor General, discussing the relative roles of the US and the
                    British Air Force in patrolling the waters there to prevent Cuban exile vessels
                    from getting started. So what I am saying is that for that period, after
                    Kennedy's assassination, late 1963 on, the whole Cuban issue was off front and
                    center as Johnson increasingly became involved in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were following in the footsteps of other
                        government officials in the 1850s, 1870s, 1890s, who were also trying to
                        stop filibusters from doing the same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Except in this case it was a weird process. We would have Customs agents
                    who had infiltrated the Cuban exile movement. They would watch them until they
                    were about to take off and just as they were about to take off in a plane or a
                    boat, they would nab them and take them down to the Court House where our
                    offices were. They would be booked and then orders would come to release them
                    the next day. This is rather a strange way to deal...we couldn't be too rough on
                    them, you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you dampened it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: And it would take some months for them to get everything started again.</p>
                <p>By the way, I found out...it was a very useful assignment. It was almost like
                    being a consul in a foreign country. What I found out was the way to deal with
                    political, terrorist activities, criminal activities ...intelligence is the only
                    answer. Just thinking what happened in New York this past week.</p>

                <p>SUMM: I didn't want to go to Africa. The idea of being Consul General had its
                    appeals, but I knew that Africa, in general, was not where all the action was
                    going to be and that I, at an independent post, unless something unusual
                    happened, would be forgotten and would not help me career-wise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angola at that time was a Portuguese colony.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: There was an insurgency going on there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1965-69. What was the situation in
                        Angola at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: There were two insurgencies going on when I arrived and a third developed
                    while I was there. So the Portuguese were having to deal with these in various
                    parts of the province. It became clear quickly that there was going to be no
                    early solution to this. That the insurgents operated from privileged
                    sanctuaries, countries on Angola's borders, Zaire and Zambia. So the Portuguese
                    could keep them from advancing, but could not eliminate them. Therefore, among
                    those of us in the consular corps, who watched this, it became clear that the
                    solution would have to come from Lisbon. Sooner or later when the Portuguese
                    tired of this, that much as in the case of Vietnam, the solution came here in
                    Washington rather than on the ground.Life in Angola, perhaps surprisingly, was
                    very pleasant, in Luanda, at least. My wife and I, when we didn't have anything
                    social on, used to walk our dogs out in the park or near the fortress where the
                    Portuguese command headquarters was, because the Portuguese had urban terrorism
                    under control. None of that happened there. However, in order to inform myself,
                    I traveled constantly and was all over the province going to all 15 districts. I
                    was in convoys, flew in small planes, right down to places where a lot of the
                    fighting took place in the recent civil war. I was familiar with all these
                    places.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were technically reporting to our Embassy in Lisbon.
                        To whom did you belong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: My efficiency reports were written by AF, Bureau of African Affairs. But I
                    was also instructed to keep Lisbon informed of everything I was doing. So in
                    effect I had two bosses. I don't mind this. I am a sort of agile sort of person.
                    I like dealing with complicated situations. Ambassador Tapley Bennett came down
                    and spent two weeks in Angola and we traveled the province together, found that
                    we shared views about many things. Let me put it to you this way, my brief, in
                    terms of what I was to accomplish, was to try to persuade the Portuguese to
                    allow Africans more of a say in how things were run. And I attempted to carry
                    that out to the best of my ability, even knowing it was impossible.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Well, you talk to officials or you try and make contacts with blacks who
                    seem to be loyal to the Portuguese. You try to encourage activities that are
                    aimed at improving the welfare of the blacks. When the Portuguese tell you that,
                    “We have been here for 500 years and we, unlike the other European powers, will
                    never abandon Africa,” you look at them very seriously when they talk, but when
                    you have gained their confidence you find that they didn't believe this
                    either.</p>
                <p>My wife was an enormous help to me, by the way, with her Brazilian background. I
                    used to describe her as a ping-pong ball, which the Portuguese and I used to get
                    at each other. They didn't trust us. The Portuguese thought we were after their
                    colonies, as ridiculous as it may seem. Giving up their colonies has turned out
                    to be the best thing that has ever happened to them. But they didn't think
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One hears that the Portuguese had not made much effort to
                        meld the Africans into their government there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Hardly anything. They had this myth, which many of them believed
                    themselves, that the Portuguese have a unique multiracial skill that no other
                    Europeans have. And that Brazil, they say, is the best example. And that the
                    blacks were really loyal to them, but that just wasn't so. And the intelligence
                    officials there knew it wasn't so. I am dubious how successful they have been in
                    multiracial terms, even in Brazil. But in Angola they had an African society
                    which was intact with its tribal arrangements, which just rejected them, in
                    contrast to Brazil, where the Africans themselves were uprooted.</p>
                <p>And, in fact, looking at their own census activities, the numbers of Portuguese
                    who had actually come to Angola was pitifully small. I think by 1940 there were
                    only 50,000 Portuguese in the colony of 5 million people. So it was only from
                    the forties on that Portuguese immigration began in large numbers. So their
                    claim that they had been there for 500 years was largely specious.</p>
                <p>And the Portuguese had done very little to prepare the Africans. One has to look
                    at Portuguese resources themselves. They had very little with which to do it.
                    They were a poor country. So there was a lot less then meets the eye in terms of
                    their ability to prepare for independence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the various rebel groups at

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SUMM: No, we couldn't have. Their representatives outside Angola, whether in
                    African countries or in the US, were in touch with US officials. But I
                    couldn't.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Toward the end of my stay, Gulf Oil Company discovered offshore oil. Other
                    then that, nothing really.So, the objective was to prevent an African colony of
                    the Portuguese from going communist afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets have representation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about you? You were saying they viewed you with
                        suspicion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Yes, at the beginning. The Portuguese wondered why the US was not
                    supporting them wholeheartedly. Their conclusion was that we wanted these
                    colonies for ourselves. This gradually dissipated as I made it clear that my job
                    was really to keep informed about what was going on. I was not making
                    representations to them for any change in their policy...that was being done by
                    my Embassy in Lisbon. So what I found was that I was able to travel rather
                    freely, got a lot of cooperation from people. When we had visiting
                    delegations...War College, etc...we were able to be briefed by their officials.
                    That suspicion dissipated and we had good relationships and, as I indicated to
                    you, good enough so that we got to the point where they confided to us their own
                    apprehensions about the likely longevity of their stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel in talking to people back in the African
                        Bureau that Angola was pretty far down the line, that Africa was not on the
                        front burner of American foreign policy anyway and that Angola was pretty
                        far down on the African Bureau's agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: As you recall, in 1961 when Kennedy came in, Soapy Williams was made
                    Assistant Secretary for Africa. This was to give it high prominence. This was
                    the period of decolonization. The US was going to make common cause with these
                    countries. But as time went by, again once Kennedy was no longer on the scene,
                    Africa did assume that...and Angola was less important then others. Perhaps, if
                    any importance only because of its proximity to South Africa. Even there,
                    Mozambique was much closer to South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't have the feeling the South Africa was
                        looming over you, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SUMM: No. The South Africans I knew there maintained a very low profile. They
                    cooperated with the Portuguese in a military sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left there in 1969. Then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I came back to become Director of Research for Latin America in INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: For seven years. Two years of that time I was also head of research for
                    Africa. This was an economy move. INR had to cut spots. My superior knew that I
                    was well informed on Africa so I...as one of my subordinates used to describe
                    it, I was trying to reverse continental drift.</p>
                <p>It was an intellectual challenge. I liked doing it just for the fun of it, but
                    after a couple of years I said it was enough. I groomed a deputy.</p>
                <p>It was during this last tour that I had my single best achievement in the Foreign
                    Service, I would say. Why would I make a claim like that? I just finished
                    talking to you about all the interesting times I had in the field. But in effect
                    in terms of accomplishing anything, events sort of passed me by. I always came
                    in too late or too early. I am pleased and proud about what I did for my
                    country, but what I did was to conduct foreign relations and that is fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Exactly. But the hopes I had had to become a hero or somebody really
                    special, etc. just never prospered. In this job, as Director of Research for
                    American Republics, what I found was that the quality of the analysts that were
                    coming to us, Foreign Service people, were not what I wanted. These people were
                    not interested enough in their jobs. And particularly, what was happening was
                    that as the US was taking a lower profile toward Latin America, as we did in the
                    Nixon era, there was less opportunity for activism. INR has never been regarded
                    as a stepping stone to a career. People who I knew and who I thought would be
                    good for the job and I tried to recruit for analyst spots would turn me down.
                    Then I heard, this was in 1973, of openings that Administration was creating so
                    that we could recruit academics from the outside for analyst positions. I was
                    able to recruit five people. Through my academic contacts I was able to find out
                    likely candidates and went out and interviewed them. Here it is, twenty years
                    later, and all these people are still in the Foreign Service. Two of them are
                    the backbone of that office in INR.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very important, I think. What were some of the
                        issues, particularly in South America, which you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Mainly with Chile. Salvador Allende came to power in 1970 and this was the
                    Nixon-Kissinger period and the two-track policy toward Chile which I will not
                    elaborate on here. But as part of the intelligence apparatus, we were involved
                    in this because what we were doing was analyzing and commenting on reports we
                    were getting from overt and covert sources on what was going on in Chile. We put
                    several analysts to work on this. I sent two of them to scour the biographic
                    archives at CIA for a week. They had enormous files on Allende, trying to
                    determine which way he would jump. And they couldn't. There just wasn't enough
                    in the files to get inside the guy's mind. I don't think he himself knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather from people I have interviewed that he was more a
                        prisoner of events then people might think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: Probably. But from our point of view I guess the most notable incident was
                    when a political ambassador, John Davis Lodge in Argentina, who received a copy
                    of our intelligence analysis...these were distributed laterally to all
                    interested embassies...wrote to Ray Cline, then the Director of INR, saying that
                    he thought there were communist line people in the Intelligence Bureau
                    misleading US policy-makers. Shades of McCarthyism. Well, my boss, the Deputy
                    Director of INR, was incensed enough about this that he wrote an
                    official-informal for Ray Cline's signature saying that he had full confidence
                    in his analysts and in their objective ability to see things as they were and
                    that in effect he rejected comments of that sort.</p>
                <p>But there has been this recurring pattern. It came up in Brazil in the fifties,
                    and then it came up here again in the seventies. I am not sure that the
                    Department of State ever rid itself of McCarthyism.</p>
                <p>I retired in the mid-seventies, but at least up until then I always used to think
                    that people both here and in the field had to make sure that they burnished
                    their anti-communist credentials, lest somebody accuse them of not being strong
                    enough anti-communists. Perhaps some of them did it unconsciously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about how things worked in Chile?
                        I gather we really didn't know how Allende was going to go and did we
                        know...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SUMM: Well the kind of analysis that our office was doing made the point that
                    democratic institutions in Chile, such as congress, the courts, the labor
                    unions, the media, the army, were alive and well. Chile was one of the better
                    examples of successful democratic institutions in South America. And left to
                    their own devices, given no more than moral support from us, they could deal
                    with the Allende problem. We couldn't make recommendations in our intelligence
                    analysis, but the objective always was...you present your case and the
                    policy-maker would then say, “Well then, I should do so and so.” We wouldn't
                    recommend what he should do, but it would flow from the analysis presented.
                    Therefore, my conclusion would be that the US ought to keep its cotton-picking
                    hands off Chile, especially since it was a long distance away. It was not in
                    this Caribbean basin where the US had always been involved since the 19th
                    century, and this represented no serious threat to us.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Nixon and Kissinger had other ideas. And in fact, looking back on
                    it, I think our assessment of the situation was correct. That these institutions
                    were strong in Chile, so that when the army did step in it was, as far as I
                    know, it was not the US aid to the Chilean Army that prompted the overthrow of
                    Allende. In fact Pinochet even kept a lot of his plans to himself, did not tell
                    us because he did not want us involved in these things.</p>
                <p>So from all this, domestically and in foreign policy terms in our European
                    relations, we reaped the reputation for snuffing out democratically-elected
                    liberal movements just because we found them unpalatable to us, when if we had
                    kept our hands off the same result would have happened anyhow and the US would
                    not have been tarred with the brush.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In INR, what was your impression of CIA reporting versus
                        State Department reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: I think they each had their role. The State Department's came from overt
                    sources. CIA was tasked with picking things up from clandestine sources. I used
                    to wonder sometimes if those clandestine sources picked up all that much useful
                    information. But then again, harking back to my OAS experience, it is good to
                    have something on the ground just in case you might be able to use it. After
                    Jimmy Byrnes at the end of World War II abolished INR's predecessor, George
                    Marshall and Dean Acheson reconstituted it, because they felt that policy-makers
                    ought to have more than one source of information. Institutional biases creep in
                    and therefore the more available intelligence you have the better.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SUMM: In 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do then?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>SUMM: I made my easiest Foreign Service move. I packed four cartons of books and
                    moved them up here to Georgetown where I remained for 12 years. I came as
                    Director in the Masters program of Latin American Studies. Then I began to teach
                    courses in US-Latin American relations and discovered I loved teaching.</p>
                <p>In 1983 I was invited back by FSI as a contract employee to run their Brazil
                    course, which I have been doing ever since. As of last year I started doing the
                    same thing for CIA. And I have been writing.</p>
