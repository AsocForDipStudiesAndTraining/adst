                <p>WILLIAM G. RIDGEWAY</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: G. Lewis Schmidt </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 28, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: This is Lew Schmidt interviewing Bill Ridgeway at his home in Nokomis,
                    Florida. This is February 28, 1989.Bill, I would like you to start out by giving
                    a little background about how it was that you got started in doing radio and
                    motion picture type work, follow in with your activities in the Army and the
                    military government in Korea, and then indicate under what auspices and just how
                    you got integrated into USIA, or rather its predecessor agencies. Then we will
                    discuss the various program work that you did.So, Bill, please take it from
                    there.</p>
                <p>Beginnings of Government Work with U.S. Military Government Health and Welfare,
                    Korea 1946</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Thank you, Lew. I arrived in Korea in late January, 1946 as a U.S. Army
                    PFC. Subsequently, I was assigned to our military government, and designated the
                    Public Health and Welfare Officer in the 44th MG Company, located in the
                    province of Chon Ju. The company was located in the town of Chung Up.It was the
                    first time I had ever had any experience working with foreigners, or supervising
                    anyone. I was assigned two GIs (no more knowledgeable than I) to fight a very
                    bad cholera epidemic. Apparently, the cholera was brought to Korea by refugees
                    returning from China. That gave me my first taste of dealing with foreigners. In
                    that summer and fall of '46, we cared as best we could for nearly a half million
                    people, afflicted, or at risk to cholera. Our three teams of medical students,
                    headed by a Korean doctor, inoculated everyone in the province twice. We
                    chlorinated wells, sprayed homes with DDT, and buried the dead. Road blocks to
                    curtail travel, using the Korean police, were set up.In this time of great
                    misery I expected everyone to work together. My eyes were quickly opened to the
                    real world. To my amazement I learned the doctors were selling fake stool exams
                    (to allow travel), and the police were easily bribed. I grew up that summer. It
                    was quite a baptism for a very green kid from Honesdale, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>By Happenstance, Ridgeway is Offered Assignment to Armed Forces Radio Station</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In my off time I developed photographs for the men in the company and repaired
                    their radios. Parts were hard to come by, and scrounging was a way of life. I
                    needed a certain type of radio tube, so on one of my official trips to Group
                    Headquarters in Chon Ju I went to the Armed Forces Radio Station to scrounge.
                    (That trip, as it turned out, was the beginning of my Foreign Service
                    career.)When I went there — this was late in the fall of 1946 — I discovered
                    their transmitter was off the air. The Army radio engineer had rotated back to
                    the States, leaving them in dire straits. The civilian program direct or asked
                    me to see what I could do. Fortunately, I was able to repair the transmitter and
                    get them back on the air. He was quite happy with my work, saying that there was
                    a spot open for a civilian engineer. Well, I had never really thought of staying
                    in Korea or taking on a civilian job there. I filed the offer away in my memory
                    and went back home with my radio tube.A month or so later I was shipped to Seoul
                    for return to the States. There the radio job offer became more attractive. I
                    was assigned to the replacement depot located in Inchon. It was a terrible
                    place, a former Japanese army barracks without windows, without hot water, heat
                    or anything. Food and coffee were frozen on the mess hall floor. And, worst of
                    all, no sign of a ship!</p>
                <p>Foreign Service Career is Launched — Army Discharge Becomes Army Civilian
                    Employee</p>
                <p>After living under these circumstances for about six weeks, I went into Seoul to
                    see the major in charge of Armed Forces Radio. They were quite happy to see me,
                    and said they had been expecting me — I don't know why, as I had never indicated
                    any interest. They immediately signed me up to take on the radio job (and made
                    glowing promises about the rapid promotions I should expect).They gave me the
                    appropriate papers to have signed, necessary for discharge in Korea. I returned
                    to Inchon and went around and obtained all of the signatures and clearances
                    necessary for discharge. I was probably one of the first few GIs to be
                    discharged in Korea.I received my discharge, to be effective that night at
                    midnight. I hitchhiked a ride into Seoul on a Korean truck with all my worldly
                    belongings in an Army duffel bag. I checked into the civilian billet — it was
                    the first time I had seen a bed with sheets and had hot water in a very long
                    time.Three days later I was on a train back to the radio station in Chung Up. I
                    stayed there for eight or nine months, and then the station was closed and I was
                    moved to Seoul as assistant engineer.My duties more or less were to take care of
                    the equipment, and now and then to assist with some of the control board
                    work.</p>
                <p>Meets Future Bride</p>
                <p>The next important turn in my life was when I met the young Korean girl I
                    eventually married. I met Tongsuk during a remote broadcast we were doing in
                    Ewha Women's University during Christmas week. We began to see each other,
                    which, needless to say, was quite difficult for her in those times.</p>
                <p>1947: Ridgeway Moves from Army Radio to Army MOPIX and in 1949 is Taken Over by
                    Department of State</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The impending move of the radio transmitter I was responsible for to the
                    boondocks would doom the romance. I was able to have myself transferred from
                    AFRS to the motion picture section of the Army's Information and Education
                    division. I'm not sure what it was called at the time. It was under the
                    Department of the Army, that I remember. Again I was involved in the technical
                    aspects of taking care of all of the equipment used by Motion Picture
                    Distribution.In January 1949 my organization was taken over by the Department of
                    State from the U.S. Army. At that time my own personal problem of trying to
                    obtain permission to marry improved. Under the Department of State, unlike the
                    Army, it was possible to apply for permission, which I did — and, incidentally,
                    including a copy of my resignation. If I was turned down, they would accept the
                    resignation and I would be shipped out.</p>
                <p>Marriage, June 1949</p>
                <p>Well, anyhow, four months later we received permission to marry. (The letter of
                    permission included the warning that I could not expect advancement in the
                    Service, being married to a foreigner. Fortunately, things changed.)We were
                    married on June 8, 1949. A year later I was still doing the same sort of work,
                    assistant to the motion picture officer, Chuck Tanner. (Still no promotion.)</p>
                <p>Home Leave: June 1950: Korean War Begins</p>
                <p>We left on June 10, 1950 for the U.S. — my first home leave and my wife's first
                    visit there. We were in New York City two weeks later, when on June 25, 1950,
                    the North Koreans invaded the south.We lost everything we owned, that we had
                    left in our small government-supplied house. I think it was located east of the
                    Capital building in a compound called MG-II. There had been rumors for some time
                    of an impending invasion. Tongsuk had been asked by the director (PAO) to
                    monitor the North Korean radio. In the last broadcast she listened to, the
                    communists boasted they would celebrate Liberation Day (August 14, 1950) on the
                    steps of the Capital building — in Seoul. They did!We were refugees in the
                    States. My pay had been stopped because my pay card had been lost during the
                    invasion. Eventually, we received a small temporary allowance to tide us over. I
                    went to work in our New York City office and worked there until October, when I
                    was given the assignment to return to Seoul as motion picture officer. Chuck
                    Tanner apparently refused to return to Seoul because he couldn't bring his wife.
                    No dependents were allowed at the time.</p>
                <p>October 1950: Ridgeway Returns to Korea (Without Wife); Seoul in Ruins</p>
                <p>So I went back. The city, needless to say, was quite different from the one I had
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they permit you to take your wife back with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though she was a native of Korea, they wouldn't do
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No. Later on they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Okay. At the time I returned it was in October 1950 and the city was
                    quite a mess, and the PAO —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Spear?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, Bob was much later. Stewart, it was Jim Stewart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jimmy Stewart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Jim Stewart was PAO at the time. Needless to say, he was quite busy, so
                    I went to see him and asked him, “What am I supposed to do?”</p>
                <p>Ridgeway Restores MOPIX Operation</p>
                <p>So he said, “Well, try to get what you can together, and get the movie thing
                    going. My original staff and the motion picture production staff were able to
                    find out where the communists had stashed our raw film stock and pre-print
                    material. We literally went around and picked up all of the staff that they
                    hadn't taken north. Fortunately, we were using 16 mm. film exclusively with our
                    mobile units, not 35 mm. They had left the 16 mm. and taken the 35 mm. stock and
                    prints.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said where the material had been placed by the
                        communists. Were these the North Korean invaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about them? By that time they had been
                        driven back north of you and your staff knew where they had stashed this
                        while they were around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, right. So fortunately they only used 35 mm. raw stock. They left
                    great quantities of our 16 mm. raw stock, and had not taken too much of our
                    pre-print material. The equipment, which really was nothing to brag about, we
                    recovered. So we got the operation going.</p>
                <p>North Koreans, Aided by Chinese, Reinvade South; Evacuation to Chinhai</p>
                <p>Our first production was a three reel, or thirty- minute, film on the progress of
                    the war. Then the roof fell in. The Chinese communists got into the act and
                    started the next round of the invasion.By this time it was in the dead of the
                    winter — mid December. We were faced with the problem of finishing what film
                    prints we were making and at the same time starting to evacuate. I used seven
                    bottles of whiskey to obtain seven boxcars from the U.S. Army sergeant in charge
                    of boxcar assignment. At the railhead we loaded the boxcars with all of our
                    equipment, the employees and their dependents — a total of 350 people. One by
                    one they were shipped off to Pusan — final destination was Chinhai.I shuttled
                    back and forth between Seoul and Chinhai, hitchhiking on military aircraft.
                    Everything on track, I left on the final trip out of Seoul somewhat after
                    Christmas. The city fell to the second invasion in a few days. We went to
                    Chinhai because we had a small Information point (Center) that was to serve as
                    our new studio! The building was the former Japanese naval officers' club of
                    Chinhai, of typical Japanese construction with sliding paper doors — a real fire
                    trap!We put all of our stuff in the building and tried to place our people
                    around town, wherever they could find room for their families.By this time
                    headquarters had evacuated from Seoul to Pusan. I went to see the PAO to report
                    that we were down, et cetera. He asked me what did I need? I said we needed to
                    fix the place up and make some rooms light-tight, and bring in water and
                    electricity.</p>
                <p>Restoration of MOPIX Production Facilities at Chinhai</p>
                <p>I already had made some preliminary estimates of what it would cost. The plan was
                    to do the work ourselves. All of the Korean staff members had other skills,
                    because in those days almost all of the people in motion picture production
                    started off as floor sweepers in commercial theaters. There they were able to
                    work their way up through the ranks, so to speak. Most of them had little or no
                    formal training in any of the arts. To have been a bricklayer earlier and a
                    scriptwriter today was quite normal. Consequently, we had a large reservoir of
                    talent in the organization. I had a staff of about eighty-five people at that
                    time.I told the PAO I would need about $7,000 or $8,000 — something in that
                    neighborhood. He said okay and gave me a chit for the Budget and Fiscal office.
                    I was given a duffel bag of Korean currency and a carbine with a magazine of
                    ammunition and was told, “Here you are.”I put the money in a bank in Chinhai and
                    we started to fix the place up. It took about six or seven weeks and we were
                    back in business again. It worked out quite well for, oh, about a year. We were
                    producing a weekly newsreel, and I think by that time we had even started to
                    produce Korean adaptations of American films.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first question is not a direct question on the
                        program, but I have forgotten. How far did the Chinese and North Koreans get
                        after they overran Seoul the second time? Did they get down to the periphery
                        of Pusan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought they did — almost took Pusan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, yes, almost. Our studio in Chinhai and later Sangnam was just — I
                    guess it would be west of Masan, east or west, whichever way it is — to just the
                    other side of Masan, looping north to just the other side of Pusan. The Pusan
                    perimeter was the closest point that the Chinese and the North Korean forces
                    came. It was quite close.</p>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: One of our mobile unit drivers was shot in the butt when he and a USIS
                    American, being happily waved on by South Korean forces, went past the front
                    lines. Pretty soon they discovered where they were. As they went around a bend
                    they were fired upon, the Korean driver being wounded.</p>
                <p>Nature of MOPIX Production: Themes: Danger of Undercover North Koreans</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to a question about the program, now. Besides
                        the newsreels that you were producing, what was the theme of the pictures
                        you were producing? Did they have a story line or were they documentaries,
                        or what sort of material were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: The newsreels that we turned out were designed to support the efforts
                    of the Korean government and the U.S. in fighting the war. It was clearly
                    propaganda. We called the communists just about every vile name you could think
                    of, and used all kinds of statistics and facts that would bolster morale. It was
                    the Korean government's policy to foster hatred of the communists.I questioned
                    some of this myself at the time, because the most dangerous communists, outside
                    of someone coming at you with a tank or a gun, were the ones you could not
                    identify. The most dangerous ones were the ones working under cover, and there
                    were a number of them.The Korean government totally ignored that concept, at
                    least as far as their own propaganda went. My attempt for a different approach
                    in anticommunist propaganda, began with a script written in collaboration with
                    our Korean writer. We produced a full-length black-and-white anticommunist
                    feature film called “Boxes of Death.” It was a story showing how the communists
                    used an agent in the guise of a young wounded veteran. He came to the village
                    carrying the ashes of a young man who was from the village. He had been
                    allegedly killed in combat — actually it was a cover.The audience was able to
                    understand this — that was how it was scripted — to see how the communist
                    undercover operative was able to turn one faction of the village against
                    another. The agent's purpose was to disrupt the Korean government's operation
                    behind the front lines. To use the ashes of a dead hero for cover was considered
                    quite vile of the communists by our audience (and this was the reason I used
                    it).That was the first time, as far as I know, that this particular approach was
                    used in trying to point out — a communist could look just like you or anyone
                    else. The Korean government posters would show the communist as a bloodthirsty
                    monster, with a knife clenched between his teeth and a knife in each hand.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, we had no problem there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to cover this in detail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: As I said, the “studio” was a fire trap. We insulated it against sound
                    the best we could. We built a soundproof booth using rice hulls for insulating
                    material between double walls. For the glass in the window of the soundproof
                    booth we used jeep windshields. It was all improvised.We also scrounged a lot of
                    stuff from the air base that we were able to use. I worked out a deal with the
                    U.S. Air Force at the Chinhai air base, a few miles away (which used to raise
                    Hobb with our recording sessions) to borrow a 16 mm. automatic film processing
                    machine.</p>
                <p>Cooperation with Army-Aided Film Production</p>
                <p>None of the equipment we were using at the time was automatic. The machine was
                    very helpful to us because we could produce our 16 mm. prints faster. We also
                    used it to process their gun camera film. Normally they were shipping their gun
                    camera film back to Japan and not getting the film back until the following day.
                    By processing the film the same day, the pilots could see the effectiveness of
                    their strikes, before the next mission. The base had the equipment but not the
                    know-how. They had no one who could run it or whatever.So we scratched their
                    back and they scratched ours. It gave them almost immediate access to their gun
                    camera films after a strike in the north. The pilots were well served, as were
                    our own needs.</p>
                <p>But Film Processing was Still Done by Makeshift Means</p>
                <p>You may wonder why a film-processing machine was such a prize. All of our film
                    was developed in two hundred-foot lengths on curtain stretchers dunked in wooden
                    tanks by hand, with no temperature control of any sort.In the winter, the soup
                    (developing chemicals) literally was put in large GI aluminum pots and heated
                    over a GI gas stove. It was then dumped back in and stirred around to bring the
                    temperature up to the approximate degree it should be. In the summer it was the
                    same thing — the pot was floated in cut-off fifty-five gallon drums of ice and
                    water to cool it off.</p>
                <p>We ran three eight-hour shifts and worked seven days a week. As I said, we had no
                    modern equipment. It was all done by hand.The film came out of this mess coated
                    with a very thick scum. We hired young girls who did nothing more than scrub
                    every inch of film with a mixture of ammonia and alcohol. Every inch of film was
                    scrubbed that way. Since the film was broken down into two hundred-foot lengths
                    for developing, it had to be spliced together for the next step. When your sound
                    is on one piece of film and your picture on another, little bits and pieces were
                    always missing. To correct this, we went through the horrendous mess of sound
                    matching which would take a week or more to do. All of that to complete a
                    ten-minute reel of film!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the actors who participated in the films?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: All local.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just picked them up around the place, or were they

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: A combination. What we would usually do would be to go into a village
                    and talk to the head man and explain what we were doing — sit and drink some
                    sake, tea or something, and discuss the film and point out how it was helping
                    the war effort. This would take quite a bit of time.We would get his cooperation
                    and the cooperation of the villagers. We would usually pay a little bit, not too
                    much — pay them as laborers, but really for the services of using their house
                    and their village or whatever.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you been trained in it or just picked it up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, I just picked it up. I had only two people on the entire staff who
                    spoke English moderately well.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, no. Eventually I became reasonably fluent — not always proper, but
                    at least I communicated.</p>
                <p>A Windfall: Acquisition and Renovation of a New (Fireproof) Studio Building in
                    Sangnam</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The next phase of our development began due north, over the mountain from
                    Chinhai. There I found this fantastic empty building, 150 foot by 50 foot wide,
                    two stories of solid reinforced concrete. Prior to the Korean War it had been
                    looted by the local people for all the stuff they could recover from it — wooden
                    frames from the windows, wiring, pipe, whatever. But it was very well built. I
                    saw this shell as a potential fireproof studio. In those days such a building
                    was an extreme rarity, especially unoccupied.The war was still going on. This
                    was, I guess, in late 1951 or early 1952. On my next trip to Pusan I extolled
                    the virtues of this new site to the powers that be. Everyone thought it was a
                    great idea, but really a dream. It was assumed we would win the war and move
                    back to Seoul. The idea to have film production located permanently, so far from
                    headquarters, was not looked upon favorably.Well, I took 22 visiting firemen
                    from Washington through, including Herb Edwards, who was head of IMV at the
                    time. He saw the potential for the building. To my surprise, at the end of the
                    fiscal year I received a hurried call from Pusan saying, “You now have $25,000
                    to fix the place, and all the contracts have to be let within ten days!”Needles
                    to say, we did it and we moved in. The facility was a thousand percent better,
                    and this time, besides much better security, we were off by ourselves. We had a
                    country locale where we literally could build sets right on our own property,
                    with our own rice paddies and everything. We did a lot of shooting in the studio
                    — now we had a real sound stage for the first time. It was well soundproofed.
                    All the pieces began to fall together. We began receiving the modern automatic
                    development and printing equipment that I had ordered from the U.S. For the
                    first time we were properly equipped.My serenity was soon shattered. All of the
                    lab chiefs went on strike when the new processing machine arrived. They thought
                    they would lose face in not knowing how to operate it, so consequently they
                    quit. I don't know what they really expected us to do, but anyhow I was able to
                    train their assistants in on the new machine. That was the end of the old lab
                    chiefs and their strike. They all had their own special formulas which were
                    closely guarded, even from each other. It was assumed we would be helpless
                    without their know-how.The film that we processed by the old system was
                    terrible. A particular scene would go from white highlights and pure black
                    shadows to absolutely flat gray because of the difference in processing the film
                    at different times. So, finally, for the first time we were now able to turn out
                    reasonably good quality, consistent photographic material — and, best of all, at
                    the same time, at a much greater pace. The new equipment included sound
                    recording equipment that used magnetic film. We no longer had the problem of
                    matching two hundred-foot lengths of film together — everything was done on one
                    big one thousand-foot roll, what an improvement!The staff absorbed the new
                    techniques. We literally hired young girls from the rice paddy and trained them
                    in how to run the film printers. They were much better than the men. First of
                    all, they followed instructions and didn't have to unlearn anything like some of
                    the older movie people.A good two-thirds of the staff were originally contract
                    employees. I had placed them all in Foreign Service Local positions when I took
                    over, as the contracting was a dodge, and a convenience for graft. Their former
                    boss, the contractor, was now chief local. He did not like it at all, because he
                    no longer was making a lot of money. He was a constant problem, but necessary,
                    as his age and former position insured staff loyalty. Korean society respected
                    age and position — both went hand-in-hand. I was twenty-seven at the time, my
                    authority a conundrum to the Koreans — and resented. (We Americans often ignore
                    the cultural traditions of the host country, a legacy we pay for later.) The new
                    people we hired and trained followed “clean room” rules carefully and were much
                    better employees.</p>

                <p>Early 1953: After Home Leave, Ridgeway Returns to Sangnam with Family —</p>
                <p>I returned to the U.S. for home leave in December 1952 to pick up my wife and
                    daughter Janet, who was born in the U.S. I was given permission to bring them
                    both back. Tongsuk was the only other dependent besides the ambassador's wife to
                    return to Korea at that time. We returned in early 1953, while the war was still
                    on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, yes. He came over to visit the operation. (Now it is a humorous
                    story; it wasn't then.)</p>
                <p>Ambassador Briggs Makes a Memorable Visit to New Studios</p>
                <p>He came over with his wife and, I think, his daughter. They were coming over to
                    visit the studio, and then were driving over to Chinhai to look at the cherry
                    blossoms. You may remember that Chinhai during cherry blossom time was a sea of
                    pink and white. It was quite beautiful.I knew the ambassador liked very dry
                    martinis and insisted on mixing them himself. Fortunately, in the things we had
                    brought from the States we had included the usual Foreign Service necessities —
                    glassware, silverware and other stuff for fine dining, of course.We had just
                    arrived at the studio in Sangnam only a week or two ago, and everything hadn't
                    been unpacked. So while the ambassador was on the way (I had not been notified
                    he was coming until he was on the way), I was busily unwrapping martini glasses
                    we had in a cabinet.Then I put them out — I don't think my wife had even noticed
                    that. So after the ambassador arrived, the first thing he wanted was all the
                    mixings.I brought the glasses out and my wife was making funny waving motions at
                    me. I didn't realize what it was, but apparently the glasses were very, very
                    dusty. You know, I had too many things on my mind, and the last thing I would
                    notice was the condition of the glasses, I suppose. So I put them out for the
                    ambassador and he — if he noticed it, he ignored it. A real diplomat!They had
                    lunch with us. The kitchen stove had blown up just before he arrived and we had
                    black soot slowly filtering down all over everything. These things would only
                    happen when you have a VIP like that. It was quite funny, but not at the time.He
                    was a very fine man. I drove him over a terrible mountain road in one of the
                    original mobile units to the cherry blossom festival. It rode like a tank. The
                    women and my baby daughter Janet rode in his staff car. The ambassador asked me
                    many questions about my operation, and actually briefed me on the political
                    situation. He seemed very pleased with what we were doing. I was the only
                    American there and everything was running well. The studio site was a great
                    bargain. I had arranged to lease it from the Korean navy for ten years without
                    charge — a free lease hold arrangement. We paid no rent or anything, so it was a
                    very good deal — and we were able to extend the lease indefinitely.Ambassador
                    Briggs had that wonderful ability to make one feel they were part of the team
                    and important. It was a day I shall never forget.</p>

                    that as a camera truck later.The original mobile unit was a jeep that some
                    contractor in the States had built a body on. They were extremely heavy and very
                    cumbersome. The whole thing was not terribly well done, but it was better than
                    nothing. The built- in generator gave us power to show our movies throughout the
                    country.</p>

                <p>We stayed in Korea until 1958. We turned out a large number of productions. My
                    wife participated in two of the more important ones — the birth of my son Bill
                    and my daughter Cindy. After thirteen years in Korea it was hard to leave. It
                    was on to the States for home leave, and our first “normal” assignment — the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>But First, Further Discussion of Later Years of Korean Tour</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the rest of the time you were in Korea, were you
                        more carefully directed — I mean, were you more centrally directed as to
                        thematic treatment, or did you just go on doing pretty much what you had
                        been doing before? Were there any changes in the type of product that you
                        were putting out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A: Small Degree of Guidance or Supervision of Film Production from USIS
                    Headquarters</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No. Actually, while I was located in the Philippines I had nothing at
                    all to do with —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of while you were still in Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: While I was still in Korea, for all practical purposes until I left in
                    1958, I decided what went into the reel and its contents. The finished prints
                    would go up to Seoul each week. It wasn't practical to review a weekly reel.
                    Communications were very poor, and certainly not secure for classified
                    discussion.We only had one of our newsreels held up by the Korean government
                    censor once. We were telling the exact unpleasant truth, and the government did
                    not want to have it shown. It was about a political rally by the opposing party,
                    and the government had said in the media they controlled — the press and radio —
                    that only a few thousand people showed up. Well, in our film you could see
                    people as far as the eye could see. Obviously there were far, far more than five
                    thousand people.Outside of that one time we had no real problems. I would have
                    program direction, so to speak, every month or so when I would go to Seoul. It
                    was no big problem. We developed a slogan after the war — after the truce
                    started — “We will work together as we fought together.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Bob Spear come on while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, yes. He was there during the war — a very nice person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, he was. He came back and died of lung cancer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, I liked Bob.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in effect, you were practically autonomous. You were
                        saying what you were going to do yourself. You didn't get really much
                        guidance or direction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No time — really, no communication in those days, you see. It wasn't
                    until the last two years, I think, that we were in Sangnam that we finally were
                    able to obtain a single side band radio. We were able to link up with the other
                    field posts and Seoul. Of course, you couldn't discuss anything classified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: We did not have a classified courier service, either. Also, it was just
                    plain common sense what we were saying and doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really were not synchronizing in a direct sense
                        with other elements of the U.S. Information program. You were doing what you
                        thought was right and producing things that were acceptable to the
                        government —</hi>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: — and every week this was reviewed by the PAO and everyone else in
                    Seoul and no one found any fault with it, so I suppose that is one way to look
                    at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who was your successor when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Niels Bonnesen — well, actually my successor in Sangnam was Lorin
                    Reeder, who had come on board as my assistant — I forget now exactly — a year or
                    two before I left. It was sort of awkward because he could have been my father
                    several times over. As you know, that was one of the problems I always had from
                    the very beginning, being so junior to everyone who worked for me — really
                    awkward.(Pause.)</p>
                <p>B: Sangnam Operation Proved Viability — and Value — of In-Country, On-Site
                    Production</p>
                <p>Lew, Sangnam proved the viability of the concept and the need for facilities to
                    produce on-site informational film material, and to do adaptations of films
                    about America. It provides the immediacy and the current local language being
                    spoken at the time. Most of the films we received from Washington, voiced in New
                    York, were with the wrong accents, and described things with words that were
                    long out of date. It also was far cheaper.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, yes. We would get — eventually we did all our own versions in
                    Korea.</p>

                <p>And USIS Films “Make” a Korean Movie Star</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: We started a — because many of the American-made films contained
                    concepts that were complicated or difficult to get across, I started an
                    introductory series for use with such films. We used an actor to play the role
                    of “a grandfather” — you know, the chap in the black horsehair hat and with the
                    long bamboo pipe. The character was called — “Halibaji” — grandfather, an
                    authority figure that would command respect and would be listened to.This
                    character would introduce a film live, in a setting appropriate to the subject,
                    and explain something about the content that was not apparent in the original.
                    We used his live sound along with the Korean soundtrack of the original film.
                    His explanation would put it in a context that the people could understand. That
                    was much easier for us to do than to re- edit. That was impractical to do anyhow
                    as we wouldn't have access to the pre-print material. This was cheaper and
                    easier to do and much more effective.We would have a little — oh, maybe a
                    three-minute intro, and then at the end of the film he would come back on again,
                    with about a minute or two. He would reiterate, “This is what you should have
                    understood or learned from what you have seen.” An example would be, explaining
                    something as complex as the United Nations, or a film about the United States.We
                    made, oh, several hundred of those. In fact, the actor who played the part
                    became quite famous in Korea for his role as “Halibaji,” the grandfather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went on to a commercial career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, yes. It worked out quite well. There were a number of things we did
                    that were not normally done in the film business, but we had a war going on and
                    then we had the reconstruction period after the war. The important thing was to
                    get the material out in a form that could be assimilated by the people.To insure
                    that our films were communicating the intended message, we would have an
                    interlocked screening for a typical audience. (An interlock is when you run
                    edited picture on a projector and the matching sound is on a different machine.
                    The effect is similar to the finished product.) We would invite people from the
                    nearby village. They would come and look at it, and when the showing was over we
                    would question them to see if they understood the points we were trying to get
                    across. If they didn't, we would change the script, and/or change the
                    cut.Sometimes we would do that two or three times. It allowed us to produce a
                    product suitable for our target — the villager. This way, we were able to come
                    up with a product that communicated the ideas we were trying to get across,
                    about reconstruction, health, sanitation, or whatever.</p>

                        which was: getting away from the strict war themes, what else were you
                        presenting? I presume — I gather from what you said that you were presenting
                        films that were promoting what the government was trying to do to rebuild
                        the country —</hi>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: Right, right, exactly — and to make sure that they would maintain
                    loyalty to the government, and, of course, support for the U.S.The documentaries
                    that we made, or Q the American- produced films that we made adaptations of,
                    would cover a wide range of things on government, education, agriculture
                    methods, the United States — not necessarily always appropriate for Korea, but
                    at the same time they would convey the idea that the government can help the
                    farmer.We were trying to point out that the government is your friend — the
                    Korean government is your friend — because, after all, there was a tremendous
                    amount of very bad press that existed before the war. And, of course, the
                    communists left no stone unturned to paint the government in the worst light
                    possible. The government had a pretty poor, well-deserved reputation from the
                    beginning, making it easy for the communists.</p>

                    correctly remember, most of the problems we faced at that time with the
                    government were Rhee's desire to march north.</p>
                <p>E: The Controversial North Korean Prisoner Release</p>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: Well, allegedly the reason they all were released was because they
                    turned anticommunist and all wanted to stay in the glorious south. That was the
                    reason the Korean government gave for releasing them, rather than to “force them
                    to go back,” against their will. (The U.S. position was displeasure,
                    unofficially ...)</p>

                <p>Korean Progress from “Ox Cart” to Major Industrial Nation in Few Years Was
                    Foreshadowed by Ingenuity Shown by MOPIX Korean Employees in Early 1950s</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Well, it is very interesting to look at the progress the country has
                    made. We are talking about a major industrial power that has gone from an ox
                    cart economy to supertanker construction — in a few short years.During the time
                    we were building our studio the ingenuity of the staff became quite apparent. We
                    could make almost anything, and often we literally did. We constructed a film
                    printer for an example. We obtained scrap aluminum from the air base and melted
                    it down to make castings. They were machined in our own machine shop, where we
                    made the parts and created a piece of machinery that would cost $10,000 to
                    $15,000. We did it in our spare time for a few thousand dollars — most of that
                    spent in the U.S. to buy the parts we couldn't make.We could keep almost
                    anything running. You mentioned the Delahaye. There was always something going
                    wrong with it. We modified it with cannibalized parts from U.S. trucks — it
                    eventually ended up half or more an Army three-quarter ton truck. The Koreans, I
                    suppose, because of necessity were great improvisers. They seemed to be able to
                    understand how things work quite well, so I am not at all surprised to see how
                    they went literally from an ox cart society to four lane superhighways. Almost
                    anything you buy there is made in Korea.</p>

                        to it.</hi>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, that's true. They work quite hard, too.</p>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: It is interesting — getting back to a film that we were working on. We
                    wanted some visual examples showing people working together. We did a lot of
                    research and the only thing that we could come up with in Korean society,
                    traditionally, historically, that people collaborated on was only one thing —
                    the distribution of irrigation water for the rice crops.In those years,
                    weight-lifting, tennis or any of the individualistic sports were common. Sports
                    that depended on teamwork were quite rare.Apparently this has changed. They have
                    instilled the same group work ethic they have had in Japan.(Brief pause.)</p>

                <p>A: Manila Job Was Regional Service Assignment Supporting Vietnam, Laos and
                    Cambodia</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: The assignment in the Philippines was to the position of Regional
                    Motion Picture Officer. I was responsible for the completion of USIS films being
                    produced in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Saigon was producing a weekly newsreel in
                    French, Chinese and English and Vietnamese. I think we did French, but I may be
                    wrong on that.The material would be put on the Pan Am flight Friday night. We
                    would meet the plane, rush the material to the lab, have it processed and turn
                    it around and ship it back by Monday. So usually I worked every weekend. I did
                    not do the work myself. I just supervised and approved what the lab was
                    handling, both with the sound recording and in making the answer prints and spot
                    checking the release prints. (The answer print is the first print made. It is
                    used to determine if all is satisfactory, prior to the full run.)</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Right, exactly.</p>

                <p>B: Putting a Stop to Theft of Raw Film Stock</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: The problems we faced there were the difficulties of keeping the lab
                    and the contractors honest. Apparently they more or less stole, appropriated or
                    whatever you want to call it, all the raw film stock they wanted. They got away
                    with it just by simply saying that it was destroyed or damaged in processing,
                    and no one ever bothered to check on it.I had the same problem in Korea, where
                    law raw stock and, in particular, camera film were quite valuable. It was a
                    hundred times more expensive than it would be in the States, so it was an
                    excellent item for sale on the black market.So what I did — the same thing I had
                    instituted in Korea — was in effect a double entry bookkeeping system for raw
                    film. It is not as easy as it sounds because it has to be handled in the dark.
                    When I started checking the records, we had anywhere from thirty to fifty
                    percent wastage on certain types of stock.For example, on sound recording film
                    they would say they needed a thousand feet for a ten-minute film. What I
                    discovered was that they were using both sides of the film — both edges of the
                    film. First they would record one way, rewind and then use the other edge. That
                    way they would get two rolls of film from us for one reel, and they would pocket
                    the other. That was just one example.I was able to cut the shortages, through
                    waste or by theft, by instituting the accounting system. We cut it down to
                    approximately three percent on release print stock, well within the commercial
                    average.What I did was make them — if they took a thousand feet of film, to give
                    us back a thousand feet of processed film — it didn't matter if it was good or
                    not, because they would not know whether we put it on the rewinder and checked
                    it (in the dark).They would give us back processed film and film that had not
                    been exposed. They were instructed to splice together in the dark, and use it in
                    printing rush prints — perfectly satisfactory. There was no reason to use good
                    uncut stock when you are going to cut it up later, anyhow.That way we were able
                    to reduce our film budget considerably, with large savings for the
                    government.</p>
                <p>C: Rebuffing Bribery Offers</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Needless to say, this did not put me in a favored position with the contractors.
                    When I first arrived in the Philippines, I was met at the airport and offered
                    the keys to a nice little red open sports car for my use. I thanked them for the
                    offer and graciously turned it down.Later on I was also offered — or the
                    insinuation was there — that if I needed an feminine companionship, this could
                    be very easily arranged. So basically my position was to keep my staff of two on
                    their toes in handling the books, and to make sure the labs gave us what we were
                    paying for and not cheat us blind.By the way, one of my staff was Pat Kelly, a
                    Filipina of great charm and well connected to the power structure. Years after I
                    left the Philippines, she married — General Lansdale, the famed
                    counter-insurgency expert. We kept in touch while we were residing in
                    Washington. The general died a few years ago.Every five or six months or so, the
                    MOPIX officers in the three countries would have a mini-regional conference. I
                    would fly over and discuss the various problems they were having with the films
                    they were sending me. Some were technical and some were problems of content. I
                    remember offering my observation about Vietnam. There was no way in the world we
                    could hide the fact, and keep it secret, the bid six-foot Americans in jungle
                    dress dropping in and out of helicopters.My opinion at the time was that we
                    should have informed the Vietnamese public, and given some rational reason why
                    they were there, because otherwise the communists, as they did, would just pick
                    it up and run with it.The assignment there really was quite blah in a way, not
                    at all exciting — quite pleasant living but nothing really extraordinary. The
                    main highlight was the birth of our son Robert, evening out the family to two
                    boys and two girls.</p>

                <p>New York Assignment: 1963</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: After the Philippines we were assigned to New York. I was supposed to
                    go to Washington, but because President Kennedy was shot the slots were all
                    frozen. The only open slot was a slot in New York, at the MOPIX office in New
                    York, so I was assigned there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That meant you were in the Philippines a total of nearly
                        five years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Five-and-a-half years. There was nothing really exciting about the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: The job in New York was not too bad. Let's see, I was — what — a
                    production supervisor. I supervised the production of adaptations of American
                    films, a few special newsreels, and screen magazines for the Middle East. It was
                    all done under contract, of course. I would simply go in and look at the film
                    during the different stages of production, and approve it before release
                    printing and shipment.We would take some of the films into Washington once a
                    month for interlock approval by Washington. I would go up along with the
                    contractor.</p>
                <p>Great Trials of Trying to Get Film Production Contractors (and USIA MOPIX
                    Officers) to Adapt Stateside Production to Needs in Less Developed Countries</p>
                <p>Again, I had not too much to do, except to try to get the contractor to use
                    editing, sound recording or script techniques that would suit an overseas
                    audience rather than an American audience. This was one of my major struggles.
                    The only production that I personally scripted, and supervised the shooting of,
                    was a three-reel film on Kenyan livestock officers. They were here on a grant.
                    Part of their trip was to spend a day with an American farm family in
                    Coffeeville, Kansas.I had quite a bit of difficulty with the contractor because
                    I tried to have it edited for an African audience. Although I have never been to
                    Africa, I could imagine the situation there. They would need a slower-paced
                    production than something that was just a series of five or six frame cuts. It
                    was quite popular at the time, under George Stevens, to make artsy-craftsy films
                    for the film festivals. That type of thing — was very nice for a showcase film —
                    for when you left the Agency, to get a new job. It was not the way to convey
                    ideas about an American lifestyle to — blacks in Africa.So, anyhow, after quite
                    a hassle with the contractors — they were all positive that Washington would
                    reject the cut — I took the rough cut to Washington and Alan Fisher (Chief of
                    Foreign Production) liked it very much. The director of the Agency liked it too
                    — I'm trying to remember, I think it was Carl Rowan at that time. Anyhow, there
                    was a bit of a feud going on between him and George Stevens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The African area director wasn't Ned Roberts, was it, or
                        had he gone? I think he had left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes. Anyhow, he wrote a memo to Stevens saying, “This is exactly like
                    the kind of films that we want for use overseas,” which did not do me any good
                    with IMV. The even bigger sin was the very low cost of my production. After
                    that, the word was put out, there would be no more “in-house” production.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, you could use that term. The situation when I arrived in Bangkok
                    was that there was a quiet memo-writing feud between the motion picture officer
                    and the information officer. They both were saying why this should be this and

                <p>A: Adapting Local MOPIX Production in Thailand to Thai Village Understanding</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, Jerry Novick was. It was just a clash of personalities, and because
                    of it nothing much was being done. Jerry was wary of motion picture types, as I
                    think he used the term. Well, I have never considered myself a motion picture
                    type in the sense that I had to imitate Hollywood.It took some time for me to
                    convince Jerry that there was a way to do what he wanted. I could produce the
                    films that would convey what was necessary to the village audiences.I am sure
                    Jerry felt he was sticking his neck way out with what I suggested we needed to
                    do. As you know, the Thai villagers were far more primitive than Koreans. So, if
                    anything, you wanted to have whatever you were trying to tell them as lifelike
                    and realistic as possible.So that is what we started to do — producing both
                    documentaries and feature-length films. We used very few of the standard motion
                    picture techniques of cutting. We used long, continuous slow shots, live
                    dialogue and color. And for the first time in Thailand we actually used live
                    sound in a film produced on location up country. It worked out quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you always producing feature-length films or did you
                        have a series of documentaries and newsreels, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: We had a screen magazine which we turned out every two weeks. In the
                    early years we covered things that were taking place at the Trade Center, AID
                    projects, some visiting American, or an event at AUA (the Binational Center,
                    called the American University Alumni Association, therefore AUA). This was
                    after, as you may remember, the great change-over from a field program to an
                    urban program. You may remember this quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had left by the time they cut off the field

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, I know, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I left just as they were starting to cut that out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: It was too bad, just when we really learned how to produce good
                    counter-insurgency material they stopped it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that you were producing another kind of
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, the tactical film?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the tactical film.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, yes. To inform or teach a small group of people at a relatively low
                    cost I came up with the idea for a quick and dirty technique. It would not be a
                    typical motion picture, but would use motion picture equipment and modified
                    technique. We would enlist the branch post — if and when they had a need for
                    such a film. I will use an example. In a southern province the rubber planters
                    were trying to improve the quality of their rubber.The branch PAO, along with
                    his local employees and the people in the Rubber Institute, prepared a simple
                    type of script. It was a set-up in real time, using a series of tables to hold
                    the props used in the demonstration. They would demonstrate how crude latex was
                    turned from liquid latex into a block of rubber, all within ten minutes, going
                    through the various stages and steps.The camera would follow the action (and the
                    expert) by panning, tilting and zooming from a tripod, centrally situated. The
                    experts from the Rubber Institute would be providing a running narration in real
                    time — no editing. Mistakes were corrected verbally, without stopping the
                    camera.A ten-minute roll of 16-mm. film was placed in the camera. A sound
                    recording machine was recording the sound on magnetic film, while at the same
                    time the speaker/narrator walked through, to practice a few times. They would
                    practice that way and then shoot it. Now, maybe if something was really terrible
                    they would shoot it twice, but in most cases the man would just correct himself
                    and just continue.The film would be sent to Tokyo, without titles — if they
                    wanted to have titles they would draw simple titles on a card, and the camera
                    would zoom in to include them at the beginning.Basically, the camera was fixed
                    on a tripod.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A single camera.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: A single camera. It was all arranged so that by panning and zooming you
                    could follow what was being described, whether it was on the rubber thing or new
                    strains of rice or whatever.It would be shipped to Tokyo, and Tokyo would merely
                    develop the film, match up the sound, which was a few seconds job, and knock off
                    six or seven or ten prints for that particular locale. It would be back
                    literally within a week for use in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did all the showings of those take place through our
                        mobile units in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, or they were loaned out to the government, but usually from our
                    own mobile units.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, yes, yes. We had several very interesting projects with the palace.
                    The king wrote the music, being an excellent jazz musician. He wrote — I think
                    it was — a four-hour opera. He wrote the music and the queen worked on the
                    lyrics. Most of the cast was from the royal household.We shot it in 35-mm.
                    color. They bought all of the materials. They paid for all of the processing and
                    they paid for all of the shipping. All we did was to supply the equipment and
                    the know-how and do the editing for them. The film was produced to raise money
                    for the queen's charity, a children's charity. I don't remember the name of
                    it.It really turned out quite well, not too bad at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we ever use that film in any of our village
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: I don't think we ever used it. We completed it just a few months before
                    I left. It may have been afterward, but the reason it was produced was for a
                    road show throughout the country to raise money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that also you produced some of the king and
                        queen's visits to various special events on their tours around the country
                        when they were “do-gooding” for the benefit of the people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We always presented the king and queen with a copy of the
                        film when it was completed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes. We also produced a special film for the king and the president
                    when Lionel Hampton visited. Were you there then?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember that. Maybe it happened either before I
                        came or after I left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: It was a very special arrangement. We shot their session and it was
                    completely private, not for use in any other place. That was the arrangement.
                    Now, whether the president ever saw it I don't really know. I had no way to
                    know. We sent a copy to the Agency for the president as agreed, and a copy went
                    to the palace with appropriate ceremony.</p>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, this was Hampton, Lionel Hampton.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes. The idea was that it was a special event, with a copy for the
                    president of the United States and a copy for the king of Thailand. It was the
                    king and Lionel Hampton, playing the king's compositions together.</p>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes. It was great. We ended up with about a twenty-minute film.We had a
                    presidential visit — it escapes me which president it was —</p>
                <p>USIS Had Excellent Relations with the King, Queen and Royal Palace Staff</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably was Nixon, because we had a Nixon visit while
                        you were there and I was there. I think the visit of Lyndon Johnson preceded
                        my arrival. Perhaps you were there also when he came, but I wasn't. I was
                        there in 1969 when Nixon came.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: It probably was Nixon. We had excellent relations with the palace. When
                    we wanted coverage, instead of having to go through the Embassy to the Privy
                    Council for permission, Kun Sumon of my staff would get on the telephone and
                    call the palace. Our contacts were the twins, confidants of the king. They had
                    grown up together. We would receive approval to do this or that within a few
                    minutes, literally holding the phone, while one of the twins checked it out with
                    HM. (One twin was in charge of the king's radio station, and the other the rest
                    of the media — motion pictures.)</p>

                    for Royal Family</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So when the president came, as you well know, a great flap went on. We had the
                    usual problem with press pools and camera pools and what have you. Everything
                    was very carefully slanted to favor American television coverage.We — USIS —
                    were literally frozen out of coverage of the president's return dinner, and I
                    think one other occasion where only the president was there. The camera pool was
                    limited to American TV and, of course, the royal Thai photographers.They
                    probably would have skinned me alive if Washington had ever found out about what
                    we did. What we did was to arrange with the palace for our cameramen to be
                    accredited as royal Thai photographers. They were given appropriate lapel pins
                    and were accredited by the palace. This way they were allowed inside the palace
                    for coverage. Without that coverage we would have had a great gap in the
                    thirty-minute film of the king and queen with the president, and none of the
                    president's return dinner.At all of the Thai functions we had no problem
                    because, again, we used the palace credentials, but not in the president's
                    dinner, which was sort of ironic in a way. It was that kind of closeness that we
                    enjoyed with the palace that allowed us special privileges.The film that we
                    produced of the visit was thirty minutes long and very, very popular. It was
                    used in almost all of our shows for a long time because it showed the U.S. and
                    the Thais being very close and friendly. The king and queen are very popular and
                    their friendly association with the president made him quite acceptable also — a
                    rationale for the film.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what some of the basic themes and story
                        lines were in those films?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: One feature-length film was on health and sanitation. We (and the
                    government) wanted the villagers to shy away from the village witch doctors and
                    medicine men and to use the health clinics. This was the rationale to make the
                    film. We wanted to show that the government was there to help you.There was a
                    rather long intro of about thirty minutes showing this attractive young woman,
                    quite pregnant and having problems because, one, she had not had the proper
                    prenatal care and, two, she had gone to the witch doctor. Of course, the child
                    was stillborn — that made the point.So we wove throughout this two-hour film the
                    advantages of having appropriate health care from the government. It was not in
                    an obtrusive way, not as a lecture, and not saying this is how it must be done.
                    It was done by using an example: where they did not use the clinic, misfortune
                    came their way. For the person who followed the appropriate path, they had
                    healthy children.We made two anticommunist features. Again, that same technique
                    was used: how the communists behind the scenes plotted against the people was
                    shown. In their forced meetings the communists would hold in a village, they
                    would tell the village head man to get everyone together. Then they would
                    lecture the people on the evils of the government.To counteract that, what we
                    did in the film was to show the communist chief and his henchmen plotting what
                    they are going to do. We eavesdropped while they had a back-and-forth
                    conversation discussing what was the best way to convince the villagers.The
                    villagers have watched our film. So, later on, when this same thing occurs in
                    real life — the communists come into a village and try to persuade the villagers
                    — the villagers have been inoculated. They can see how they are being
                    manipulated and used. In theory it made sense. Research seemed to support
                    it.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, but, as you know, in Thailand at that time, sound on film
                    production was not commonly done. They were using versionnaires in the
                    projection booth playing all the voices — each time the film was shown to an
                    audience! It also was a very convenient way to dodge the Thai government censor.
                    They would start with a script that had been approved. As soon as they were out
                    of sight of the city, they would say more or less what they wanted to say, in
                    most cases quite risqu�. They literally played to the mood of the audience at
                    the time.In many cases the versionnaires were as famous, or as sought-after, as
                    the actors themselves — really an interesting art form.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you produced this one health film. You produced a
                        couple of anticommunist films, in effect how to look out for agitators and
                        how to recognize a communist infiltration attempt. Do you remember what the
                        fourth film was about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: No, I can't. I think it was something to do with — again, it was
                    something to do with health, but I am not really sure — it may have been a
                    combination. I just don't remember. It has been almost twenty years.</p>
                <p>Use of Early Video Recorders as a Tool of MOPIX Production: Value as a PR Device
                    and as Economy of Film Production</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, for the first time — at least it was the
                        first time in the USIA program — you used television which recorded on the
                        scene, so that you could tell whether or not the film that you had just shot
                        was going over properly. You had it in black and white, of course, but you
                        could tell whether it had been shot properly, and if it went all right you
                        didn't have to do retakes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: That's right. I had forgotten that. We used the first pre-commercial
                    example of the Sony home video recorder and the advantage of it was two-fold.
                    One was to have the actors and the director see how things were going. This
                    allowed the director — because directors, Thais being Thais, hated to tell
                    someone they haven't done too well. They are very sensitive. So that way on the
                    screen actors could see themselves, so suggestions could be made in a much more
                    gentle way.It also was a tremendous PR tool with the villagers, because the
                    villagers could see what was happening immediately on the little screen. This
                    helped everything to go over very, very well.The savings of film stock was
                    tremendous because we would rehearse it on tape. Once it was okay, then we would
                    shoot film and tape, so when we finished the scene we would review the videotape
                    and see if there was anything wrong no one had caught.Our shooting ratio to
                    edited and good footage was about 1.5:1, which is almost unheard of, so we paid
                    for our video equipment almost immediately.</p>

                        of those tapes, too. Did you give them an opportunity to show themselves on
                        the tape and then have it played back to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Oh, yes, the village head men and others — particularly people where we
                    were using their house or their yard or whatever in the village. It was an
                    excellent PR tool. It was most useful.We also used a Polaroid camera, too, which

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes. I would go out not too often — in fact, oh, maybe three or four
                    times a year. I would go out and see how things were going. I would usually go
                    out on the feature productions.</p>

                <p>Use of Special Effects in Making Films for Village Showings</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: I had to worry about some of the special effects that we improvised.For
                    example, in the anticommunist film we had someone shot in the chest with a
                    shotgun in one continuous take. Again, the idea was to make sure this was
                    something realistic rather than being faked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: That particular time was when I threw my back out and was in the
                    hospital. I came back from up country and was really quite wrung out.One becomes
                    very tense, because if someone is hurt in doing something like that it makes
                    excellent propaganda for the communists to pick up and say, well, see, they are
                    trying to malign us and at the same time they are killing people.I worked out
                    several techniques — for example, when the communist chief executes the village
                    head man, the camera is behind him. He gets down off the wagon where he has been
                    standing while speaking to the villagers. He gets down — all one continuous
                    shot. He walks up about six feet from the head man, pulls his revolver and fires
                    point blank in the guy's chest. He fires three shots and you see the blood
                    squirt out of the guy's shirt — and you hear the shots, too, all in one
                    continuous take.The other scene was a re-enactment of a true incident where a
                    village schoolteacher held off — “held off” is not a good term — shot the
                    communists who came after him. He was in his house and had barricaded himself
                    behind sacks of rice up on the second floor.The camera shows the communists
                    going up the ladder and then the camera cuts to inside, and you see our hero
                    with a shotgun leveled at the door — a double-barreled shotgun. The door is
                    kicked open and there you see, looking over the shoulder of the teacher, the two
                    communists in the doorway.Our hero fires the shotgun at point blank range right
                    at the chests of the two men, and this bloody mess erupts from their chests —
                    visually quite effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a shot that you later worked into a feature film,
                        or how did you use it once you got it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: That was part of the feature film. That is what had me so concerned,
                    because it was quite dangerous, but I was able to work it out. What we did to
                    produce this effect was to take a regular shotgun shell apart and remove the
                    powder and the shot. I had obtained from Washington, from IMV (USIA's motion
                    picture/TV service), or whatever it was called in those days, some fake blood —
                    Hollywood blood, I think it was Max Factor #3, the real good stuff needed for
                    color.To give the illusion of blood squirting out from the chest, you had to
                    have blood erupting, synchronized with the shotgun blast. What I did, after a
                    number of experiments, was to remove all of the shot and the wads and most of
                    the powder. I experimented with small loads of powder and found it all too
                    strong. Eventually I ended up just using the primer — the shotgun shell primer.
                    It was strong enough. Halfway down each shotgun barrel I placed a small piece of
                    sponge, soaked in the fake blood. There was enough force from the primer firing
                    — and a puff of smoke — and enough force to propel the blood-soaked sponge
                    against the chest and bounce out of view. It looked quite realistic. We added
                    the sound of a real shotgun blast during editing. It all worked quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering how you managed that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: The other thing for the effect on the man's shirt — the blood coming
                    through when he was hit — do you remember those tiny flash bulbs, the little
                    all-glass ones?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Well, they have a little primer inside and oxygen and fine wire. We cut
                    the end off, just left the little primer, and taped it to a little U-tube of
                    copper tubing that was closed off at the end and had a little hole drilled in
                    the side. It was taped to a piece of cardboard that was taped to the man's
                    chest.On the upper end of the U-tube was the flashbulb. It was taped in a way to
                    hold it up, so that when the primer fired it forced the blood out through the
                    fabric.The wires ran up the man's pants, inside his shirt and down his back, out
                    of sight, to the modified flashbulb. Wires went to a step switcher we made. It
                    hooked up to the sound system. Every time the gun fired (cap gun using a primer
                    type of cap), it made a loud snap and a puff of smoke. As it fired, it would
                    activate one of the U-tubes fitted with the flashbulb primer. It worked in
                    perfect synchronization — bang, squirt, bang, squirt, bang — like that. It
                    worked as planned. During editing we replaced the cap sound with sound from a
                    real gun to make the effect realistic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was probably 1970, because Shakespeare had just

                        left at the end of May in 1970. We still had all of our thirteen posts, but
                        they were soon scheduled for closing, most of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: I left in 1973. We were the first element of media production to shift
                    what we had in the works to the new program. It was a matter of re-editing and
                    shortening and changing the script. The productions that we had in the works to
                    a great degree were salvaged and used.</p>

                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes, we did — let me see, now. I guess that second one on health we did

                <p>RIDGEWAY: Well, after Thailand I thought I was going to go to Rio, and we were
                    all set to go.Hal Schneidman — I'm compressing a lot on this — Hal Schneidman
                    had decided he wanted me to go in the Exhibits Service as Production Chief,
                    which was sort of rough in a way, because I did not have practical experience in
                    exhibits. Of course, much of the film production experience would apply. I
                    suppose they assumed that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: So, instead of going to Rio, like it had been originally planned and
                    prepared for, I went over to the Exhibits Service as Chief of the Production
                    Division.I attempted to make myself useful to my new boss, Bill Davis, for whom
                    I developed a very high regard. We were able to, oh, do a number of shows and
                    exhibits that I think were useful in supporting Agency policies, et cetera.</p>

                <p>It was my first experience with Washington infighting. It was not only my first
                    experience, but a bad one. I think this can occur when a returning Foreign
                    Service Officer is thrust into an office that is populated by Civil Service
                    employees. They may be specialists or those who have never gone overseas or
                    would never go overseas.They look upon a returning Foreign Service Officer as
                    someone just rocking the boat or stirring up trouble. They are not really
                    interested, I think — in my experience — to tailor the media material for a
                    foreign audience.I have always felt that was one of my specialties. I think we
                    must try to think as an alien might, before we can be sure we are communicating.
                    We cannot expect our audiences to simply accept something, because it looks nice
                    to us, on the front of Newsweek magazine or in a window on Fifth Avenue. It is a
                    different audience to a great degree, and just because you translate it into the
                    local language does not necessarily mean it will work, either. We must
                    understand the culture — fully.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Anyhow, the office politics were somewhat annoying. One day we were informed that
                    a survey would take place in the organization. It was presented in terms that it
                    was a useful thing, since we were doing such great work. It would be nice to
                    find out if we could benefit from a further infusion of funds, additional
                    personnel or whatever. That was how it was described.However — again, this may
                    be part of the Washington in-fighting scene — it turned out that the survey was
                    a facade and, once completed, a hatchet job on Bill Davis, my two deputies and
                    myself. Contrary to what we had been promised, we were not shown the material in
                    draft form. It was presented to us in final form — at the same time it was
                    distributed to other members of ICS.We were quite unhappy about this. Our
                    protests were not listened to, so we took it to the grievance board. After quite
                    a bit of time, and back and forth arguing, our points were accepted as valid.
                    The Agency, under the signature of the director, put out a memo to all those who
                    had read the report. The report was described as harmful to our professional
                    status and careers and deemed not to have any validity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that had an adverse effect on the balance of
                        your career in the Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Yes. It is one of those unfortunate situations a person can get into,
                    quite unwittingly, where you may win a battle but end up losing the war. I was
                    offered an overseas assignment, but I felt they offered it to get rid of me.
                    They did not want this embarrassing situation continued further in — public.We
                    had a lawyer from the union working on our case. We were prepared to subpoena
                    the former director, the former deputy director and the other people who had
                    been involved in this. I have no direct proof, but I strongly suspect my two
                    deputies and I were sacrificed to get at Bill Davis — who is black. Bill spoke
                    his mind — like a senior officer should — and was, in my judgment, brilliant.
                    Too brilliant for a black man and the tastes of some — it was a vendetta. There
                    is an old Korean saying that applies: “A nail that rises above the surface of
                    the table must be pounded back.”It was a situation where, after it was all over,
                    one of my deputies retired due to the stress from it, the other soon after. And,
                    as I said, I was offered an overseas assignment. I believe they wanted me to
                    leave the scene and withdraw my grievance — which I would not do.After winning
                    the grievance, my job was reduced — the position was reduced to something of a
                    figurehead. I had very little work to do, practically speaking. I merely put in
                    my time until the opportunity to retire came up. It left a somewhat bitter taste
                    in my mouth. I have always enjoyed my time with the Agency and felt that it
                    provided me with many good opportunities.So it is just sort of sad and
                    unfortunate, but that's how it goes, I suppose. The real ironic twist is the
                    years I spent describing to our audiences the fairness of U.S. justice. At the
                    very end of it all, I find the system wanting in my own organization, pure in
                    proclaimed goals and ideals but tainted with straight-faced injustice and subtle
                    racism.</p>

                <p>Q: Yes. I consider this to be a very unhappy ending to what was otherwise a very
                    successful career. I think you were wronged.Having had personal experience with
                    you and working with you in Thailand and also knowing a number of other people
                    who have worked with you elsewhere, I think you were one of the outstanding
                    motion picture officers in the Agency, and it is just too bad that these things
                    happen and that careers have to end this way. I know how you feel.I thank you
                    very much for submitting to this interview and it has been a great pleasure for
                    me to be able to talk to you this afternoon.</p>
                <p>RIDGEWAY: Thank you, Lew, very much. It is easier now to put the survey affair in
                    proper perspective. I retired a little over ten years ago after more than 33
                    years of service. They were good years. My work was often praised and I received
                    commendations from the Department and the Agency, and promotions. Overall, I
                    enjoyed my career in film making to the utmost. We both served during an
                    exciting period in U.S. history, in a part of the world that is front stage
                    today.I believe the efforts we made during the formative years of those
                    countries have helped advance important American ideals. Democracy in various
                    stages is certainly on the rise worldwide. We participated in mass media
                    control, perhaps the most important (and dangerous) tool for social purpose.
                    Examples of such use, both for the good and the bad, surrounds us today.
                    Elements of political and religious fanaticism still exert undue influence.Only
                    time and the unfettered spread of ideas will tame the Lorelei that would still
                    entrap us. We have a good start. The force of reason should eventually prevail,
                    rather than reason of force. We were there at the beginning — what more could
                    one ask?</p>
