                <p>IKE AND USIA, A SYMPOSIUM</p>
                <p>Edited by: Hans N. Tuch and G. Lewis Schmidt</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Preface</p>
                <p>In commemoration of ex-President Dwight D. Eisenhower's 100th birthday in October
                    1990, the U.S. Information Agency Alumni Association (USIAAA) and the Public
                    Diplomacy Foundation, both of Washington, D.C., sponsored a symposium and dinner
                    on October 11, 1990 to recall the President's creation of the U.S. Information
                    Agency and his interest throughout his presidency in what is now called public
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>His executive order establishing USIA in 1953 was one of the President's first
                    acts of reorganizing the U.S. Government after his election because, as he said
                    so often, it was of utmost importance to the nation that the United States
                    government communicate with foreign publics and effectively tell America's story
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>The commemorative event took place at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C.—the
                    symposium in the Arnold auditorium of the National Defense University, and the
                    dinner and subsequent program at the Officers Club. It brought together retired
                    veterans and current staffers and spouses of USIA and related organizations
                    involved in the U.S. Government's public diplomacy. Many of those who attended
                    served in USIA here and abroad during the Eisenhower presidency.</p>
                <p>Abbott Washburn, who had been Deputy Director of the U.S. Information Agency
                    during the entire period of the Eisenhower administration, served as host and
                    moderator of the evening's program.</p>
                <p>This short volume records the prepared remarks of those who took part in the
                    symposium, Ike and USIA, and in the after-dinner discussion. They were Burnett
                    Anderson, James Halsema, Hans Tuch, Barry Zorthian—all retired USIA foreign
                    service officers who served in the Agency during the 1950s; Henry Loomis, former
                    director of Voice of America and deputy director of USIA; Frank Shakespeare and
                    James Keogh, former directors of USIA.</p>
                <p>Appreciation is due those who helped make the evening possible—Peter Brescia,
                    Fred Coffey, Cliff Groce, Mim Johnston, Robert Lincoln, Jack O'Brien, Lew
                    Schmidt, Abbott and Wanda Washburn.</p>

                <p>The Editors</p>
                <p>Introduction by Abbott Washburn</p>
                <p>When we who had worked on Ike's 1952 campaign staff came to Washington with the
                    President, Stalin was still alive. The Cold War was at its most frigid. One of
                    the first things the President did was appoint the Jackson Committee to study
                    the Cold War, to talk with everybody who knew anything about it, and to make
                    recommendations to him. I was assigned as executive secretary of the Jackson
                    Committee by C.D. Jackson, the special assistant to the President for
                    psychological operations. Wanda, my wife, was also on the Committee staff, as
                    was Henry Loomis. The Committee labored for about 6 months in a historic old
                    house on the corner of 16th and Eye, NW, now torn down.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower had faith in psychological and information activities because he was
                    convinced they had shortened WWII and saved lives. As the new President, he
                    found himself in a “battle for men's minds”. From the Jackson Committee he
                    wanted a plan and structure that would start to win the battle for men's minds.
                    Few diplomats, he felt, were good at these kinds of operations, and Secretary
                    Dulles agreed with him.</p>
                <p>The top-secret Jackson Committee report made numerous recommendations for
                    improving our conduct of the Cold War. But it did not recommend a new agency for
                    international propaganda and related activities. Eisenhower himself, however,
                    was convinced that what was needed was an organization of experts—something like
                    those who had staffed the Office of War Information. He acted on the
                    recommendations of C.D. Jackson and Nelson Rockefeller and established the USIA
                    by Executive Order in the summer of 1953.</p>
                <p>The next thing was to find a Director for the Agency. I don't know whether or not
                    C.D. knew Ted Streibert, the former head of the Mutual Broadcasting System who
                    was then serving on Jim Conant's staff at HICOG in Germany (Dr. James Conant,
                    U.S. High Commissioner for Germany). But C.D. ended up recommending him to the
                    President. Ike asked C.D. to ask Jim whether we could have Ted. (That's a little
                    sidelight on how DDE operated—it was not an order but “ask Jim if he could spare
                    Streibert.”)</p>
                <p>When Ted arrived, we knew he was the right man, a tough hard-worker who knew what
                    had to be done. I went over to the Agency as his Deputy and as liaison with the
                    White House.</p>
                <p>Ed Schechter (former USIA colleague) sent me a recent note on how it looked from
                    the other end. He was at HICOG, having helped set up RIAS in Berlin—Radio in the
                    American Sector—and having dealt with Messrs. Roy Cohn and David Schine, as did
                    “Tom” Tuch (Hans Tuch, former USIA colleague) who was also in Germany then. Ed
                    wrote:</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>...I was stationed in Bonn and Streibert was sent by the Eisenhower
                    administration as a sort of “Super PAO” to look at the giant information outfit
                    in Germany... I happened to be Chief of the Radio Branch for the American Zone
                    and since Streibert came from a radio background he was particularly interested
                    in this field. Thus, I came to know him quite well during the 3 months or so of
                    his stay and we got along very well indeed. Eventually, he did confide that he
                    would be nominated as USIA Director. People used to say that Streibert had “ice
                    in his veins.” Maybe—but at that time, with an organization quite confused and a
                    bit shattered by Cohn and Schine, he was in my opinion an excellent choice.</p>
                <p>We took our policy guidance from the State Department. But the Agency reported
                    directly to the President, who took a keen interest in its operations. He wanted
                    to see us on a regular basis, whether or not we had particular problems to
                    discuss with him. Often Ted would take other agency officials over to the White
                    House for these meetings. You can imagine what this did for morale!</p>
                <p>The President also wanted the world opinion factor to be cranked in to NSC
                    meetings when decision-options were being discussed. He put us at the table at
                    the NSC where we could speak up without being first asked what we thought or
                    what data we had. (Previously, in the back row as observers, we could not do
                    this.) Often he would ask us direct questions, e.g. “If we landed Marines in
                    Lebanon, what would the public reaction be? How would the news media react over
                    there?”</p>
                <p>He always listened intently, patiently. He always wanted the best intelligence.
                    He was always receptive to ideas, even though he might not agree in the end. So
                    you can see why he liked our opinion polls in other countries. They gave him an
                    added dimension. Henry Loomis (former Director of VOA and Deputy Director of
                    USIA) spoke with him about this, and will report on that later.</p>
                <p>Foster Dulles (Secretary of State) was against the polls. One day he called Henry
                    and me over to his office, saying that they were an intrusion, an embarrassment
                    to him, and made the conduct of foreign affairs more difficult. Henry was in
                    charge of polling at that time.</p>
                <p>We did not discontinue the polling, as you know. Toward the end of the Eisenhower
                    administration, the polls showed some disapproval of U.S. policies, thus giving
                    rise to the “prestige polls” issue in the 1960 Nixon/Kennedy election campaign.
                    The Democrats argued that under Eisenhower/Nixon American prestige had plummeted
                    overseas. In the middle of this, Oren Stephens, who headed Research for us,
                    phoned me in a state of turmoil. Oren was from Arkansas and his family had known
                    the Fulbrights for a long time. He said that Senator Fulbright had just got him
                    on the phone and demanded that he send the latest opinion polls up to the Hill.
                    He stalled as long as he could until the Senator said, “Well, are you going to
                    do it?” I said to Oren, “What did you tell him?” Oren replied, “I said,
                    'Senator, I have to go to the bathroom, I'll call you back'!”</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>That was a phony issue in the campaign. Our overall prestige abroad was as good
                    as ever. Another phony issue was the so-called “missile gap.” The President knew
                    from the U-2 intelligence-gathering cameras that there was no missile gap. He
                    could have disclosed the whole thing publicly, but he didn't in order to protect
                    the operation. This is also a sidelight on how he operated. Politics were
                    secondary. In the 1956 presidential campaign, for example, he did little
                    campaigning because the larger problems of the Suez crisis and the Hungarian
                    rebellion were on his front burner. He said that if this lost him the election,
                    so be it.</p>
                <p>Two other examples of his receptiveness:</p>
                <p>1. I wrote a memo to him via Ted Streibert in early 1955, suggesting a
                    “President's Program” to encourage personal contact by average American citizens
                    with their counterparts in other countries. He liked this from the beginning,
                    discussed it with usthoroughly. It was while on his hospital bed in Denver,
                    recovering from the heart attack, that he decided to name it “People to People”.
                    He called the White House People-to-People conference in September, 1956.</p>
                <p>2. I wrote another memo to him on the world-opinion hole we would be digging for
                    ourselves if we should ever again use atomic weapons on the Asia mainland. This
                    was when a preemptive strike was being considered against the Chinese troops
                    massed opposite the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Tactical nuclear weapons were
                    to be used. He responded with a personal letter, which may still be classified
                    at Abilene. I think my letter may have been useful to him in determining to
                    reject the recommendations of the military. He did this a total of 5 times,
                    according to historian Bill Ewald. It shows his forbearance, patience, and his
                    determination to work through crises without the use of military force,
                    especially nuclear weapons. He warned the hawks that anything we started with
                    such weapons would likely escalate into an unthinkable global disaster.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>Eisenhower predicted the upheaval in Eastern Europe which we saw last year. But
                    he thought it would happen a lot sooner. If we stayed strong, he held, and kept
                    preaching and demonstrating the advantages of human rights, freedom and
                    democracy, the Communists would eventually see their system as fundamentally
                    flawed and it would go down. He regarded the Cold War as a kind of aberration.
                    He saw our work as important in demonstrating the advantages of democracy and
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>I am going to stop at this point and call on some of the operators. Barry
                    Zorthian was program manager of the Voice at that period, and later went on to
                    other important assignments. Barry, would you talk a bit about the VOA.</p>

                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Abbott has given you a very good picture of the big picture. Let me talk a little
                    on the operational level. I assure you that at that level, our contacts with
                    President Eisenhower and the administration were fairly limited, but
                    nevertheless, the influence and the follow-through were definitely felt. I'd say
                    the Eisenhower years for the Voice of America, in an overall summary, was a
                    period of the coming of age, the maturing of the Voice of America, the
                    transformation from a political instrument growing out of World War II into a
                    legitimate radio operation, obviously with an ultimate political purpose, but
                    nevertheless, with the tone and approach and trappings, if you will, of a very
                    legitimate worldwide radio network. I don't mean all problems were solved, but
                    nevertheless, the right direction, the right courses were set.</p>
                <p>It is important in evaluating those years for the Voice, I think, to look at the
                    background. My own involvement in the Voice started in 1947. Most of the
                    personnel then were still World War II personnel who had been recruited during
                    the war. There was some new personnel, but essentially we were still operating
                    on the basis of a very competent, a very knowledgeable staff that had been put
                    together during the war.</p>
                <p>In the Eisenhower years, I had the good fortune of being at the center of VOA
                    operations. I was chief of the new central news branch until 1955, then policy
                    officer—I think the title was assistant program manager for policy—for a year,
                    and then program manager for most of the second term, from 1957 through 1961. In
                    those various roles, I was involved in changing and trying to adjust the
                    direction of the Voice.</p>
                <p>In the late 40s, we were at the peak of the Cold War. The Iron Curtain had come
                    down, later the Korean war started. The general atmosphere was a period of
                    intense growth of anti-communism, a very emotional, almost a one-dimensional
                    approach, and that was reflected in the Voice's output. It was a political
                    output. The tone was pretty strident. The policy direction was very strongly
                    anti-communist in its most negative implications. The personnel were not, by and
                    large—obviously there were exceptions—professional communicators or professional
                    radio personnel. They tended to be political people, most of them emigres during
                    World War II or shortly before or shortly thereafter, with strong ties to their
                    homelands.</p>
                <p>The “plus” on this was the intensity of the operation, the commitment of that
                    personnel, to the task at hand. The controls were strong. We were a definite
                    part of the nation's foreign policy operations. Our directors were foreign
                    policy officers, the most notable ones being Charlie Thayer and Foy Kohler. We
                    had policy officers assigned to us from the State Department with the specific
                    task of controlling the Voice, trying to make sure its political output was in
                    the right tone, in keeping with State Department policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We also were going through a period of “Why can't we sell democracy? Here we can
                    sell soap so effectively. Let's put all we know about advertising soap to
                    selling overseas, and we'll get them all very actively marching in two-step
                    toward Jeffersonian democracy.” The world, obviously, didn't operate quite that
                    way.</p>
                <p>We had periods of intense arguments with policy direction from the State
                    Department: news being left out, commentaries being harsh. We used to have some
                    extremely harsh commentaries; those of you who remember Howard Maier may recall
                    some of his output. There was some English broadcasting, but no doubt the
                    emphasis was on East Europe and the Soviet Union. We added some of the Soviet
                    Union languages during that period. News was the choice of the individual desks.
                    There was a good deal of conflict—tension, if you will—between central
                    operations and the language desks.</p>
                <p>This was the period, up to November 1952, of the Eisenhower-Stevenson election
                    campaign. One of the criticisms of the Voice at that time was that the personnel
                    tended to be Democratic. Not particularly surprising. We had just gone through
                    sixteen years of Democratic administrations. The thought of a Republican
                    administration coming in probably was against the instincts of most of that
                    personnel. I remember specifically we were criticized on election night of 1952
                    for not being enthusiastic enough in the central news room about the Eisenhower
                    victory. And that was thrown in our face many times thereafter.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower years, 1953 and onwards. Not a very auspicious start. The Voice faced
                    [Senator Joseph] McCarthy, and it was a devastating period for the Voice. That
                    challenge to the Voice, domination of the Voice, disruption of the Voice by Joe
                    McCarthy and those who supported him started before the election in late '52. It
                    focused on the Voice in early '53, shortly after the new administration came
                    into power. At the working level, the impression we had at the Voice was that we
                    were out on our own. John Foster Dulles indicated he wanted nothing to do with
                    this strange institution up in New York. (Editor's Note: VOA was located in New
                    York until 1954.) President Eisenhower was having his own problems in handling
                    McCarthy.</p>
                <p>Joe McCarthy, with the help of an internal network of supporters, almost tore the
                    Voice apart. We literally had two suicides, if I remember; reputations were
                    damaged; the operation was filled with tension, filled with personnel conflicts,
                    staff suspicions. We had very little leadership. In our revolving door at that
                    time, we had a fellow named Doc Morton, who was director of the Voice, who
                    literally refused to come out of his office for fear of getting into trouble. We
                    had one or two strong hands. Ed Kretzmann, State Department career officer, was
                    there trying to hold things together, trying to maintain our focus on the
                    output. But the personnel situation was extremely critical. A network within the
                    Voice was blowing the whistle on their colleagues.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In March of 1953, I remember very clearly the day Stalin died, and our news room,
                    as you would expect, was pouring out all the copy it could on the death of
                    Stalin. At that very moment, on television in Washington, Joe McCarthy was
                    questioning one of our desk editors on what passed for national television then,
                    accusing three of his fellow editors of being pro-communist. And the issue was
                    over the changing of phrases in a story on Guatemala—there was a revolt going on
                    in Guatemala then—changing the description of rebels from “anti-communist” to
                    “pro-democratic,” that this was a pro-communist buzzword, and the editors
                    involved were allegedly showing communist sympathies. It was in that kind of an
                    atmosphere that we were trying to operate with very little help, very little
                    assistance from Washington, either the administration or the direction of the
                    Voice.</p>
                <p>From that low point to the end of the Eisenhower years, quite a transformation
                    took place in VOA. Congress and, I assume, the administration as well, was
                    suspicious about the Voice up in New York, uncontrolled and operating on its
                    own, and the administration decided, in its wisdom, to move the Voice to
                    Washington. By early 1954, the Voice of America came down, studios and all, to
                    Washington. Studios were built in the present building at HEW, and personnel all
                    moved down here except for a small New York office. The news room itself was
                    over in that old USIA building at the corner of 18th and Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>We were to be brought back, within control of Washington. The atmosphere
                    initially was in that direction. New personnel started coming in. Those of you
                    who were around then will remember that for a very brief period we had a fellow
                    named Len Erickson as director of VOA. He happened to be a Democrat. He came out
                    of the advertising business. President Eisenhower was criticized heavily that
                    out of 30 million people who voted for him, he hadn't been able to find one
                    Republican to head up the Voice. Unfortunately, Erickson did not last very
                    long.</p>
                <p>Ted Streibert then brought in a fellow named Jack Poppele, who had been chief
                    engineer at WOR in New York when Ted was director of the station. Jack was
                    essentially an engineer. Jack brought in some of his colleagues. Gene King
                    became program manager. We had some State Department personnel, but essentially
                    we were getting our policy direction internally. After 1954, as an independent
                    agency, USIA picked its own policy officers. I guess Ed Kretzmann was next to
                    the last policy officer from the State Department. From then on, the policy
                    officers, who had, theoretically, control of content, at least the political
                    aspects, came out of the Agency itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Gradually, the devastating atmosphere set by the McCarthy period dissipated.
                    People who had been involved left the scene. Others who had been challenged
                    continued about their work. There was pressure—by direction of the NSC
                    Operations Coordinating Board, from Abbott, from the headquarters of USIA, to
                    place emphasis on straight news, accurate reportage, less political, less
                    strident broadcasting. We went through a period of adjustment. Broadcast
                    languages were expanded. We reached out to other parts of the world. New
                    programming, new personnel were added. The Voice, little by little, became a
                    legitimate radio operation, or at least headed in that direction.</p>
                <p>I think we were put to the test, the most severe test of that period, in the 1956
                    Hungarian revolt. Again, you will remember that there was criticism of both the
                    Voice of America and RFE (Radio Free Europe) for having instigated that revolt,
                    or at least made promises that led to the actions by the Hungarians.</p>
                <p>I think postmortems on the broadcast gave the Voice a pretty clean bill of
                    health. News was fairly straightforward. Some reports of official statements
                    could have been misinterpreted, but I think, by and large, the Voice came out of
                    that period looking responsible, accurate, and not responsible for the revolt,
                    or at least for encouraging revolt. RFE probably came out a little worse in that
                    accounting. Some of it seemed to be questionable, but we at the Voice certainly
                    didn't get into the details of that. I would pass no judgment, even with
                    hindsight.</p>
                <p>Our efforts and focus became the internal organization and development of the
                    Voice of America. As the months passed, as opportunities opened up, a whole new
                    series of programs were initiated. A great deal of emphasis was placed on
                    English, particularly after Bob Button replaced Jack Poppele as director of the
                    Voice. Shortly after, George Allen came aboard as director of USIA in place of
                    Arthur Larson. English was expanded and was made the main language of the Voice
                    and was put on a worldwide basis. Eventually, as African nations became
                    independent, we put on a good deal of African broadcasting. We certainly
                    expanded in Asia. We expanded in some of the Soviet languages. In English, the
                    forerunner of a whole new trend to non-political programming was “Music USA”
                    with Willis Connover which actually started while we were still in New York but
                    then developed worldwide in Washington. We followed this with programs like the
                    American Theater of the Air, the American University of the Air, Special
                    English, the Breakfast Shows, programs that were listenable, provided
                    information but were not of this strident Cold War period.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The attitude of the administration began to change towards the Voice of America.
                    The State Department backed off a good deal. There were still policy arguments,
                    but not nearly as intense as they used to be. News gained a lot more
                    independence. 1776 (Pennsylvania Ave), the headquarters for USIA, began to have
                    a little more trust in the Voice. The developments were all on the positive
                    side. Bob Button eventually was replaced by Henry Loomis as director of the
                    Voice, and Henry moved the Voice further in this direction. Also during Henry's
                    regime emphasis was placed on expanding the Voice's hardware. A plan for a
                    worldwide transmitter network was developed. A good deal of money was devoted to
                    it, and construction was started.</p>
                <p>Gradually by the end of the second Eisenhower term, we could legitimately say we
                    were a professional radio outfit. We began to get into some of the aspects of
                    modern radio, audience research, responsiveness, program booklets, reflection of
                    variety in the presentation of American opinion, less selling of soap, more
                    honest information, a respectable operation, if you will.</p>
                <p>There grew a desire to institutionalize all this, and talk started about
                    developing a Voice of America charter that would provide continuity and a basis
                    for response to criticisms and pressures. We went through a number of efforts in
                    that direction. I remember trying my hand at some drafts, and they were much too
                    long and much too tedious. Finally, Henry Loomis chose a two-man committee of
                    Jack O'Brien (Deputy Director of VOA) and myself to draw up a statement. We went
                    through a number of drafts. Finally, one night Jack O'Brien decided to cut
                    through it all, sat down at his typewriter, and batted out a very short,
                    succinct, but comprehensive charter. With only one or two minor changes of
                    words, that charter was accepted in 1961. It has the force of law today.</p>
                <p>I'll sum up the Eisenhower years this way. The bookends for the Voice came from
                    Foy Kohler, a foreign service officer at one end under President Truman, to Ed
                    Murrow, a professional broadcaster at the other end under President Kennedy. In
                    between was an eight-year period that started with Joe McCarthy and all the
                    devastation of that period and ended with a charter for the Voice of America
                    that authorized legitimate straight news, honest broadcasting, and a responsible
                    radio operation. For that change, we have to thank President Eisenhower and his
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Thank you, Barry. That was great.</p>
                <p>When I was in Moscow in 1959 and we were working on the American National
                    Exhibition, where [President Richard] Nixon and [Soviet leader Nikita S.]
                    Khrushchev debated, I got on that subway for the first time and there were some
                    young people there. They saw I was an American, and they began trying out their
                    English with me. They were pretty good. I said, “Where did you learn your
                    English?' They said, “Listening to Willis Connover.” Willis, you're here. Please
                    stand up. [General applause] Willis, you're on every day, and Lord knows how
                    many millions of people have loved the jazz and loved you and that rolling
                    voice.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Burnett Anderson was with us in those days. He was deputy head of the press
                    service and later PAO in Tehran. Burnett, you did a lot of other things after
                    that, too.</p>
                <p>Remarks by Burnett Anderson</p>
                <p>Colleagues and friends—I think most of you are both—the pleasure and the
                    significance and the appropriateness of this occasion doesn't need any further
                    endorsement from me. I've been asked to say a few words about USIA support of
                    two major foreign policy initiatives by President Eisenhower. In the words of
                    our then charter, promulgated by the new president on October 22, 1953, we were
                    to “submit evidence to peoples of other nations that the objectives and policies
                    of the United States are in harmony with, and will advance their legitimate
                    aspirations for freedom.”</p>
                <p>It would have been in 1951, when Elmer Davis was broadcasting for ABC and I was
                    representing the network in Scandinavia. He was in a reminiscent mood and
                    chatting about his experiences as a propagandist in World War II, running the
                    Office of War Information (OWI). He said that foreign information services were
                    all well and good, but it was only what was coming out of Washington that really
                    mattered. He cited a case or two when great labors over a period of six months
                    or a year in a given country had been completely wiped out by just a press
                    conference or a statement from the White House, the State Department, or the
                    Pentagon. Now, in one of my favorite French phrases, I think what Davis said is
                    a little bit true, but he overstated the case that evening. Yet those comments
                    underline a truism that an information program can ultimately be no better than
                    the message it carries.</p>
                <p>In our context, they pose the operative question “What policies did President
                    Eisenhower establish offering the world evidence that our actions and intentions
                    merited their concurrence and support?” I think my two assigned topics furnish
                    an unequivocal answer.</p>
                <p>It's pertinent to recall that the Information Agency was only four months and
                    eight days old when President Eisenhower made his historic Atoms for Peace
                    address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on December 8, 1953. Our first
                    director, Ted Streibert, and Abbott Washburn were at that time rapidly putting
                    together a rational and functional organization out of the surviving elements of
                    principally the foreign information programs in the State Department and the
                    Marshall Plan Agency. Both of these, as we have heard, along with the Voice, had
                    been ravaged by Joe McCarthy, increasingly pinched by Congress. Morale of the
                    survivors, as Tom Sorensen wrote in his The Word War, was at rock bottom.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The new Republican administration, after many years in the wilderness, was
                    surprised to find that the kind of people that they wanted to hire weren't
                    standing in line for appointments at government salaries. When they did find
                    them, security clearances, with security officers seeing the threatening shadow
                    of Joe McCarthy over every file they examined, were snail-slow and super-
                    cautious and very hard to get. The late Nate Crabtree of Minneapolis, the new
                    team's chief recruiter, often demanded, and even sometimes got, a clearance in
                    48 hours. And for years after, a fast clearance was known in the Agency as a
                    “Crabtree.”</p>
                <p>Eisenhower's offer at the U.N. to share the U.S. near monopoly on nuclear
                    technology to improve the material condition of peoples everywhere and enhance
                    the prospect for peace was not only a landmark initiative in foreign policy, but
                    ideal evidence of his determined pursuit of peace beyond pure and simple
                    containment of aggression.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, despite a plethora of obstacles and problems, the Agency, under the
                    leadership of Streibert and Washburn, was already performing with both focus and
                    vigor. Only a little more than six months after Eisenhower's speech, this
                    fledgling USIA, this new agency, was able to document in its semi-annual
                    congressional report that the Agency had given saturation—radio, press,
                    newsreel, and other—coverage to the unfolding story, that more than 6 million
                    people had already attended “Atoms for Peace” exhibits everywhere from Europe to
                    Pakistan and India, and that more than a billion had seen, heard, or read about
                    the U.S. proposal. Tom Tuch, in his new book, cites an academic study which
                    notes that the Agency participated fully in discussions of the plan and was
                    prepared, in advance, to make the president's words known around the world. This
                    was an early and, I think, perhaps precedent-setting example of Ed Murrow's
                    subsequent insistence that the Agency be in on the takeoffs, as well as on what
                    he called crash landings.</p>
                <p>It was also during the six months—and this is another sidelight that I simply
                    can't resist—that the Agency had a small opportunity to give the back of its
                    hand to Joe McCarthy, who was still riding high. Joe wrote Streibert that he
                    wanted two of his [McCarthy's] books, one alleging a generation of treason, and
                    the other presenting General George Marshall as a traitor, placed in all U.S.
                    libraries overseas. He even generously offered to contribute the books.
                    Streibert turned him down absolutely flat, in writing. I know, because I wrote
                    that letter, along, I hasten to add, with a contingency plan for all foreseeable
                    developments of the kind that you really need following an encounter with a
                    specimen of the aptly named genus mephitis. No one knows why he laid off, but
                    Joe never pursued it. He let it lie there.</p>
                <p>I think, too, that perhaps the success of this “Atoms for Peace” campaign very
                    early in the game may have been a factor in the president's opening the door to
                    Ted and Abbott to the national policy-making level.</p>

                <p>In view of the remarkable returns from the “Open Skies” proposal a year and a
                    half later at the famous summit in Geneva with [Nikolai A.] Bulganin and [Nikita
                    S.] Khrushchev, the beginning, to say the very least, was ironic, indeed. The
                    offer of mutual aerial inspection was so strongly opposed by Secretary of State
                    Dulles, no surprise to this audience, that it was stricken from the text of
                    Eisenhower's opening statement. As it turned out, it was Ike's only major
                    presentation at that conclave in Geneva. He took it into the conference on a
                    separate sheet of paper to be put forward—and agreed with Dulles on this—only
                    under particular circumstances. Eisenhower, of course, avowedly determined to
                    show the world that the soldier-president was a man of peace, found the
                    circumstances to introduce it.</p>
                <p>Our records of this period are replete with accounts of Agency support for these
                    two initiatives, and they cover no less than four pages of the Agency's
                    Semi-annual report for the latter half of 1956, only a year and a half after
                    that landmark conference. Here are some compressed highlights:</p>

                <p>The answer to the question I posed at the outset is clear. Eisenhower's actions
                    and policies met both Elmer Davis' terms and those of the USIA mandate. “Atoms
                    for Peace” and “Open Skies” were indeed persuasive evidence of a country seeking
                    peace and constructive cooperation in world affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Only last Sunday, strong support for this judgment came from what might be
                    considered by some people a somewhat unlikely source, Chalmers Roberts, who
                    covered Eisenhower during Roberts' long and distinguished career as a reporter
                    for the Washington Post. Chalmers wrote, “Open Skies was quickly rejected by
                    Khrushchev as a form of espionage, but it was a proposal so fraught with hope
                    for a war-weary world that it propelled both sides forward in their search for
                    arms-control agreements. Historically, I consider it the ancestor of today's
                    many arms-control and reduction measures. Thus, it seems to me that Ike at
                    Geneva broke the mold of the Cold War.”</p>
                <p>To the extent that USIA helped carry Eisenhower's message to this war-weary
                    world, I think we can feel a measure of satisfaction and, indeed, perhaps a bit
                    of pride. Now I'll let Chalmers Roberts say the rest of it. “But looking back to
                    those often grim years, I think Americans owe much to the soldier-president and
                    his determination to avoid nuclear war and find paths to meaningful peace.
                    Indeed, his birthday will be a day worthy of remembering Ike, and fondly.”</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: As I had the White House liaison responsibility, I remember taking over
                    there that piece of paper which told Joe McCarthy what he could do with his
                    books, the one-paragraph letter which Burnett had drafted. I had to take it to
                    Sherman Adams, because obviously that's where the backfiring would take place.
                    They had to be prepared for the blast. So I went in; he had a thousand things on
                    his desk and he was on the telephone. Finally, he turned to me. He never would
                    talk much, you know. I explained what we planned to do and handed this draft to
                    him. He looked at it, without blinking, and said, “Okay.” But in that one
                    instant, he was really saying, “We'll take any heat this guy wants to give us on
                    this.”</p>
                <p>You said Joe was offering to contribute the money for the books. Actually he had
                    some big right-winger in Texas who had come up with the money to publish the
                    books. In fact, the books were printed and were in some warehouse somewhere, and
                    he fully expected us to send them to the USIS libraries all over the world
                    saying that [George] Marshall was a traitor.</p>
                <p>Jim Halsema and I went around the world together in 1956. During the Suez crisis
                    we were shot at by the British in Cairo. I can't begin to talk about that and
                    all our other experiences on that trip. What a great thing it was to have
                    officers like Jim around. He had been for several years in a Japanese prison in
                    Manila, and he really knew the Far East. This was a tremendous advantage for us
                    in those early days of the Agency. Jim, you served in Singapore, Manila,
                    Bangkok, and in Washington you were deputy assistant director for the Far East.
                    Will you talk a little about operations in the field under Ike?</p>
                <p>Remarks by James J. “Jim” Halsema</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The first time I ever heard the name “Eisenhower,” I didn't really know exactly
                    who he was. The news filtered into our internment camp in the mountains of the
                    Philippines that a general by the name of Eisenhower had been appointed the head
                    of the European theater of operations. Who was this? I asked my family, and my
                    father said, “Oh, I met him. He was a lieutenant colonel who came out on the
                    ship with us when MacArthur brought his staff to the Philippines in '35.” And my
                    sister said, “Oh, yes, I taught his son John. He was pretty smart at math.” But
                    that was our introduction to a man who became very important in our lives.</p>
                <p>I would like to say more than anything else, that our agency and our operations
                    is not only media and policy; it's people. Looking back on our audiences around
                    the world I have talked with over the years, that the thing they remember more
                    than anything else is our people. The crowning achievement of a USIS officer was
                    when the people in the country to which he or she was assigned would say, “Oh,
                    yes, you're my friend and I believe what you have to say.” That is what really
                    counts.</p>
                <p>I came into the IIA operation, as it existed under the State Department, in 1949.
                    I was part of that World War II generation. I'd been exposed to three years of
                    enemy propaganda, and I realized that we were still in a war, with a different
                    set of opponents, but that there were still people who were trying to run our
                    country down, and that we had to tell our story and tell it effectively. That's
                    really what inspired most of us to get into this work.</p>
                <p>In 1950, we were exposed to the shock of Korea. It's hard for me to explain to my
                    children, but this so-called Cold War wasn't very cold; it was pretty hot at
                    times. We were having a plane shot down along the coast as they were snooping on
                    the Chinese and the Russians in East Asia. I was stationed in Singapore when
                    Korea occurred, and I guess the most frustrating day of my life was being up on
                    a mountaintop in Penang and not being able to find out what was happening in the
                    war. But several people that we knew in Singapore were killed in that war.</p>
                <p>Southeast Asia was a place about which most Americans were quite ignorant. A lot
                    of American military people had been to the Philippines in the course of their
                    assignments and, of course, many hundreds of thousands came there in World War
                    II, but most of Southeast Asia was a complete unknown area because it had been
                    in colonial hands. I think a lot of the problems we've had subsequently are due
                    to the fact that in the immediate post-war era, not many people in Washington
                    knew about Southeast Asia, and they cared even less.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The advent of the new administration found us in Manila. Mind you, this was
                    before USIA actually came into operation. Later on in March, 1953 we heard that
                    there were seven groups investigating IIA, which was the predecessor of USIA. In
                    April, the famous RIFs [reduction in force] began, and almost every day a cable
                    would come in saying somebody, some poor fellow or woman, had “gotten it.” One
                    of the people, incidentally, who “got it” in those days, but fortunately managed
                    to survive despite that, was Bernie [Bernard] Lavin, whom the Agency has
                    subsequently honored. But that 25% cut that Congress had ordered caused enormous
                    uncertainty to us in the field. It wasn't just at the Voice that people were
                    worried; it was people overseas wondering how long they would last. It was in
                    June that Ike submitted his reorganization plans for the Mutual Security Agency
                    and U.S. Information Agency, but the details were lacking. We didn't really know
                    what this was all going to be about.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, in the Philippines we were working on a very interesting program
                    in which we were promoting free elections. The U.S. Government was obviously
                    trying to get Ramon Magsaysay elected president, but we didn't say so and we
                    were very careful not to intervene in the election. All we said was, “You should
                    vote freely, and you should vote.”</p>
                <p>In July, after the Korean truce was announced, we heard that Ted Streibert had
                    been made the head of the Agency. We were pleased to hear that he was a man who
                    came from the Harvard Business School, and thought maybe this was someone who
                    could get the organization going so we could find our way through the morass
                    we'd been in.</p>
                <p>And it was on the 19th of October, 1953, that we got the first official word
                    directly from Washington when Sax Bradford arrived in Manila. Sax was one of the
                    four assistant directors that Ted Streibert had set up to run the Agency. The
                    system was a very good one; it was a very simple one. It was to eliminate as
                    many layers as possible. You had a man who ran the Agency in Washington and he
                    had deputies who went out and ran the program in the field. Ideally, they were
                    supposed to spend most of their time in the field. The media were reduced to
                    what he called the service level. That is, all except VOA. The PAOs (Public
                    Affairs Officers) in each country were made directly responsible to the
                    assistant directors. Sax called himself “a regional expediter. I'm your man in
                    Washington. I'm the man who will try to get things done so you can do your
                    work.” This was a whole new concept. It was one that also, he said, called for
                    the maximum possible cooperation with private organizations. We couldn't do the
                    jobs entirely by ourselves.</p>
                <p>On November 20, 1953, we had a visit from Vice President Nixon, who came to see
                    (President Ramon) Magsaysay. On December 18, Ted Streibert came to Manila to see
                    us. Here was the head of the Agency, and he was coming to see us in person! He
                    said that the period of adjustment would be over by the first of January, and
                    that he could make promises for permanent status for most of the American
                    employees—but he couldn't say about local employees at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>That, incidentally, brings up one of the real problems that we had over many
                    years. I don't think we've fully solved it. It's not just the Americans who have
                    made up our Agency; it's our local employees. They are the ones who have fought
                    through thick and thin, often at great risk to their own life and limb and
                    freedom to support our ideals. I think we cannot say too much for them,
                    particularly since we've always suffered from having to move Americans from post
                    to post so often that we never really quite got around to teaching them all
                    about the language and the culture of the country that they were serving in. We
                    had to learn, if we were smart, from the national employees we were working
                    with. They are the ones who have done our job for us on many, many
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>The upshot of all this reorganization was that Ted Streibert had promised that he
                    was going to move people around to where the need was the greatest. At that
                    particular point, Dien Bien Phu had fallen. French Indochina had been divided.
                    We were concerned, even then, about having to drop an atomic bomb, (as I later
                    understood). The idea was to bolster Southeast Asia against further communist
                    penetration, and the key was Thailand. General Donovan, “Wild Bill” Donovan, was
                    sent in to be the ambassador, and he was given a team of people from all over
                    the world to help him shore up Thailand against communist subversion. In effect,
                    this was the precursor of JUSPAO (Joint US Public Affairs Office) in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In 1955, I came back to Washington to be the assistant to George Hellyer, who was
                    the deputy to Sax Bradford. I was given one task, and that was, “Get people out
                    in the field the things they need. Go around to every one of the Agency offices
                    and make sure that they're delivering. Give them the idea that this is urgent
                    and that they've got to take extraordinary methods to get the things they need
                    there now, not later. This is not the time for bureaucratic methods.” So that
                    was my big job in Washington. I also went out to the field and I listened to
                    what our people had to say.</p>
                <p>I thought that this whole idea of the assistant directors was a very good one.
                    I'm sorry that it fell into disuse after a while. We've reverted to many of our
                    bureaucratic ways. But there's nothing better for a person who's working
                    overseas than to know that he's got somebody here in Washington who is fighting
                    the battles for him and who understands what his problems are.</p>
                <p>Over the years, we have never really reconciled the mass-versus-the-elite
                    approach. Yes, we said we were going to go for the elite, but, for instance, for
                    all the mobile units we had charging around through the boondocks of Southeast
                    Asia, we never quite got to the whole population.</p>
                <p>Until the invention of the transistor radio, radio was not really a mass medium
                    in places that had no electricity. Today, of course, it is, and we have
                    competition from Ted Turner around the world in television.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I have always felt that there was no real coordination between the field and the
                    Voice, and that that was a shame. There should have been more of that. We never
                    had enough continuity, particularly in places that had rare languages and
                    cultures, so that at least there would be one man at the post who knew what the
                    score was in that particular country.</p>
                <p>The fact is that we, as Americans, have always stressed the here and now, rather
                    than the long range. After I finished the National War College, I was, for a
                    while, the acting head of the Office of Policy and Plans. The one thing I
                    learned from that job was the Agency does not like plans. [General laughter] I
                    think that we still have the problem of collective memory. I think organizations
                    like ours particularly need them, and that a meeting like this is something for
                    which I commend Tom and Abbott and all the others who have gone to the trouble
                    of getting it together, because we need more of these get-togethers.</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Thank you, Jim. Such wise words.</p>
                <p>Tom Tuch was, of course, in Moscow and saw the beginnings there of the
                    disarmament dialogue and the exchanges. His on-the-spot perspective is very
                    interesting. Tom.</p>
                <p>Remarks by Hans “Tom” Tuch</p>
                <p>In the early 1950s, the Eisenhower Administration learned that the Soviet
                    government would not tolerate any contacts between ourselves and its people, and
                    kept its population virtually in isolation from the outside world. After the
                    death of Stalin, the rise of Khrushchev, the 1955 Geneva Summit, however, there
                    appeared the first indication of a slight thaw in the relation- ship.</p>
                <p>The thaw was at least partially occasioned by Khrushchev's desire for recognition
                    of the Soviet Union as a world power and equal adversary of the United States,
                    one whose stature and culture deserved respect in the West. The Soviets seemed
                    to have felt that earning such recognition, and even admiration, could be
                    furthered by exporting such notable cultural achievements as the Bolshoi and
                    Kirov Ballet and the Moiseyev Dance Ensemble. They further thought to convince
                    the world of the superiority of the Soviet system, as they put it, by showing
                    off their prowess in sports competitions, those they could be counted upon to
                    win, such as track and field, wrestling, and ice hockey.</p>
                <p>The Eisenhower Administration, in turn, realized that the only way we could ever
                    get the Soviets to open their windows to fresh Western views was to insist on
                    reciprocity. That is, that the Soviets permit U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges and
                    U.S. presentations in the Soviet Union. According to Arthur Larson's
                    recollection, which he conveyed in a letter to Abbott Washburn for this
                    symposium, Eisenhower said USIA's number-one job was to ease tensions with the
                    USSR. The president particularly wanted to reach young people, offer unlimited
                    access to America in exchange for the same for us in the USSR, according to
                    Arthur Larson.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>This convergence of interests, typified by “the spirit of Camp David,” (the
                    historic meeting of Eisenhower and Khrushchev), led to the negotiation of the
                    first comprehensive U.S.-Soviet cultural agreement in January 1958. The
                    negotiation had been preceded two years earlier, in 1956, by the conclusion of
                    an agreement to exchange periodicals, Amerika magazine and USSR magazine (later
                    changed to Soviet Life).</p>
                <p>The U.S. objective for this new exchange agreement was to get information and
                    ideas from America direct to the Soviet population, practically for the first
                    time. We hoped that through public diplomacy programs and personal contact, we
                    would be able to crack, if ever so slightly, the Soviet monopoly on information
                    about the West and thereby try to counteract the pervasive anti-American
                    propaganda and distorted information to which Soviet citizens had been
                    continually exposed.</p>
                <p>One must remember that since the end of World War II, there had been practically
                    no contact between American and Soviet citizens on the non-governmental level,
                    and that the only medium of communication available to the United States had
                    been the heavily jammed Voice of America. Our interest, therefore, was that
                    information and cultural activities might reach the maximum number of people in
                    as many places in the Soviet Union as possible.</p>
                <p>While the State Department was the lead organization to negotiate and conclude
                    this first cultural agreement, it was USIA that had the principal responsibility
                    of implementing it. And the three areas of primary concentration were exchanges,
                    publications, and exhibits. Cultural and educational exchanges were at that time
                    still in the purview of the State Department, but in the field, in Moscow, it
                    was the press and cultural attach�—a euphemism for public affairs officer—who
                    was charged with carrying out the program. This involved the first exchanges of
                    graduate students, of delegations of writers, composers, artists, and performing
                    arts exchanges, such as the New York Philharmonic, “My Fair Lady” and the Robert
                    Shaw Chorale.</p>
                <p>I have already mentioned Amerika magazine, which, of course, was USIA's
                    responsibility in Washington. Supervising the distribution was my responsibility
                    at that time. Every month, on the day the journal was to be distributed, I set
                    out to check the newsstands in Moscow to see that copies of the periodical were,
                    indeed, delivered and on sale. I saw lines forming immediately when Soviet
                    citizens noted the distinctive journal disappearing under the counter of the
                    newsstands, to be produced reluctantly and secretively by the sellers only for
                    favorite customers who often had made prior arrangements to obtain the magazine,
                    usually at a price considerably higher than the 50 kopecks printed on the
                    cover.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Of all the public diplomacy activities with which USIA was involved in the Soviet
                    Union in the 1950s, the one that, in my opinion, had the greatest and
                    longest-lasting impact was the American National Exhibition in Moscow in August
                    1959. It was a huge organizational, architectural, and budgetary venture that
                    was planned, designed, and coordinated by the Agency, Abbott Washburn,
                    presiding. Harold “Chad” McClellan, Assistant Secretary of Commerce, was
                    director general of the exhibition. The exhibition featured the latest in U.S.
                    home and entertainment technology (including an RCA color television studio),
                    science, fashion, American family living, consumer products, photography, the
                    Edward Steichen “Family of Man” exhibit, and art. The centerpiece was a
                    Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome that contained a gigantic seven-screen film
                    projection depicting a 24-hour period in the lives of typical Americans living
                    in various parts of the United States. The dome also held an IBM computer—new at
                    that time—that answered thousands of questions about America posed by the Soviet
                    visitors. Bob Sivard was head of the exhibition division at the time and
                    coordinated the show from Washington. Jack Masey supervised the design of the
                    exhibition.</p>
                <p>Nowadays, the exhibition is remembered in this country primarily as the locale
                    for Richard Nixon's famous “kitchen debate” with Nikita Khrushchev. But a
                    little-known story will illustrate how President Eisenhower also got directly
                    and personally involved in this public-diplomacy venture. The twentieth century
                    art that was to be displayed at the American National Exhibit had caused
                    considerable controversy even before the show opened. The criticism came
                    primarily from certain influential members of Congress who complained that it
                    was too modern, too abstract, and too extreme. History does repeat itself.
                    [General laughter]</p>
                <p>The controversy escalated to the point that it endangered the entire exhibit, and
                    it went all the way up to the president to resolve. The president, an amateur
                    painter himself, did not want to be accused of censorship, yet he wanted to
                    appease the congressmen. In a Solomonic decision, he decreed that the art
                    exhibit was to be expanded to include the nineteenth century, and that some
                    American art that was more traditional and realistic was to be added to provide
                    balance. The selection committee and curators of the exhibit objected to what
                    they claimed was censorship, but they bowed to the inevitable, and thus, the
                    exhibition became one of nineteenth and twentieth century American art.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>There is a footnote to this story. When Nikita Khrushchev returned for a second
                    visit to the exhibition—the first had been with Nixon—his interpreter got lost
                    in the crush of the crowd that surrounded the chairman as he viewed the display
                    of American art. I was one of the people escorting him, and I was corralled into
                    amateur interpreting duty. All went well as Khrushchev examined the nineteenth
                    and early-twentieth century American paintings. When, however, he came upon a
                    work by John Marin, and I explained the title “Sea and Sky,” Khrushchev
                    remarked, “It looks as though (pardon the expression) someone peed on the
                    canvas.” Stuttering, I translated. I said, “The chairman said it appeared to him
                    that a little boy had made a puddle on the canvas. [General laughter] Khrushchev
                    inquired and was told how his comment had been interpreted into English,
                    whereupon he admonished, “Please interpret the chairman correctly,” and I
                    did.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to measure, in public diplomacy terms, the impact of such a major
                    and expensive effort. In my judgment, it more than paid off. For hundreds of
                    thousands of Soviet citizens, many coming from afar, it was the first glimpse of
                    America, their first personal contact and conversation with Americans, the
                    fifty-odd Russian-speaking American guides mostly young graduate students. Not
                    only did they see something of life in America, but they also enjoyed
                    themselves, sampling Pepsi for the first time, having their hair coiffed and
                    their faces made up by Coty beauticians, swaying with the music in the fashion
                    show, getting their first look at color television, seeing the inside of a
                    typical American one-family home. And many remembered the experience for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>On a visit to Moscow fifteen years later, I met a man on the street, still
                    wearing on his lapel the American National Exhibition emblem, who told me, when
                    I asked him, that his visit to the exhibit in 1959 was a lifelong memory, a
                    pleasant memory, since it was his first look at America.</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: I remember, Tom, going into the Oval Office one day at that time, and
                    President Eisenhower had a whole bunch of these paintings around from the
                    nineteenth century. I wondered what they were doing there. It turned out they
                    were some of his favorites. One was a vivid painting of ducks hanging in a
                    hunting lodge. It turned out that he had had those brought in from the National
                    Gallery of Art, and he made a selection of canvases that he recommended go to
                    the Soviet Union. [General laughter] Of course, his avocation was painting.</p>
                <p>It's so clear to me that any one of you here could come up and talk about the
                    Agency from your own vantage point during those years, and I wish that we had
                    time for everyone to do it. One way is via the oral history project which Lew
                    [G. Lewis] Schmidt is “honchoing” so very effectively. All tonight's material is
                    going to fit beautifully into that project, I must say.</p>
                <p>We will now go over to the Officers' Club, have dinner and continue the
                    discussion afterwards with Henry Loomis. I hope, after that, that we can have
                    some give-and-take if there's any time and any energy left for a bit of Q and
                    A.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Thank you, everyone.</p>
                <p>After Dinner Session</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Two former directors of USIA are here, and two other former directors
                    were very sorry they couldn't come, namely Leonard Marks and Arthur Larson.
                    Arthur was particularly looking forward to being here and said, “There are so
                    many people who will be in your audience that I haven't seen for thirty years.”
                    He sent us a message, part of which I'll read later. He asked me to greet you
                    all very, very warmly.</p>
                <p>The current director, Bruce Gelb, also wanted to be here and Mike Pistor,
                    currently the Counselor of the Agency, has a message from him.</p>
                <p>PISTOR: Thank you. What I have is a letter to Abbott from Bruce Gelb who had
                    intended, until very late in the day, to come to the symposium. I'd like to read
                    it.</p>
                <p>“Dear Abbott, I am very sorry not to be able to attend the symposium today,
                    because I am a great admirer of Ike and I'm a great admirer of Abbott Washburn.
                    It would have been especially valuable to learn more about the origins of this
                    unique and vital agency from the lips of some of its founding fathers, and to
                    join a group of my illustrious predecessors in discussing USIA's historic and
                    continuing role in our nation's affairs.</p>
                <p>“I know that you will excuse my absence when I tell you that what keeps me away
                    is a meeting on Capitol Hill, which takes on a special urgency at this time.
                    Please accept my congratulations for a first-rate idea and my best wishes for a
                    happy and productive outcome. I took forward to hearing about the symposium's
                    conclusion. Sincerely, Bruce.” [General applause]</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Thank you so much, Mike.</p>
                <p>Earlier we heard from Tom Tuch, Jim Halsema, Barry Zorthian, and Bernie Anderson,
                    all four of whom gave us highly interesting, personal insights.</p>
                <p>Henry Loomis had two long meetings with Eisenhower, one with Ted Streibert, about
                    which he'll tell you, and one when he and I went up to Gettysburg when Ike was
                    in retirement. We had over an hour with him on that occasion. Henry, as you
                    know, served as head of the Voice of America during the Eisenhower period and
                    later as Deputy Director of the Agency. Earlier, he was also head of our
                    research operations and overseas polling during the Eisenhower administration.
                    It's a pleasure to call on him now. Henry.</p>
                <p>Remarks by Henry Loomis</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Good evening. It's great to be back with so many old friends. It's been a long
                    time. I know you've come a lot further, but I am meant to talk about the past.
                    The past is pretty interesting, as well.</p>
                <p>Abbott talked about the two personal meetings I had with Eisenhower, but there
                    were two other occasions when I learned about his thinking on public affairs and
                    information activities. The first, which was mentioned somewhat earlier this
                    evening, was the Jackson Committee—named after Bill Jackson, not C.D. The formal
                    name was the Committee on International Information Activities, which a cover
                    name. Mr. Eisenhower had been elected, saying that we would “roll back the
                    Curtain.” That sounded great in Des Moines, but the day after he found himself
                    elected, he suddenly realized he didn't have a finite plan to roll back the
                    curtain. So he appointed this committee of people, most of whom ended up in the
                    government, to take a look at what he could do in real life. Not what you could
                    say that would be nice, but rather what you would physically be able to do. He
                    appointed that committee a couple of days after his election, and asked them to
                    report well before he took over the reins. The staff had to be recruited
                    immediately from within the government. [Editor's Note: The report took five
                    months to prepare.]</p>
                <p>I was one of the dozen or so who were assigned to that staff. I came from CIA to
                    work on a particular sector. When I made my presentation to the board as to what
                    this sector could do, they turned white and said, “No, no! A thousand times
                    no!”</p>
                <p>I said, “I understand. If I were in your position, I might make the same
                    decision.”</p>
                <p>At that point, Bill Jackson said, “What do you know about IIA?” [Editor's Note:
                    IIA at that time was part of the Department of State, responsible for overseas
                    information activities.]</p>
                <p>I said, “What in the world is that?”</p>
                <p>He said, “There are two State Department people, one is a Russian expert and the
                    other is a policy planner, and they don't know anything about IIA, either.
                    You're here. So as of now, IIA is your job.”</p>
                <p>I spent the next six months learning and making up my mind. At the end, I was
                    sure I knew what should be done. Whether it was right or not, remained to be
                    seen, but I was sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Watching IIA being beaten by Senator Joseph McCarthy was like watching a snake
                    try to eat a mouse. We heard the story earlier about how Mr. Washburn and others
                    turned down the Senator's desire to put his books in the libraries. I did not
                    have that experience, but I had another one, because Mr. [Roy] Cohn and Mr.
                    [David] Schine, first of all, wanted me to go to the Hill and get the word. I
                    said, “I'm sorry. My office is up here,” which was on I Street. “If you want to
                    see me, I'm here anytime you're ready.” After about the fourth invitation to
                    Capitol Hill, they started inviting me to Mr. Schine's hotel in New York, and I
                    said, “No, I'm sorry. I can't go to New York. My office is here.” So I never had
                    direct contact with that group, for which I am most grateful. [General
                    laughter]</p>
                <p>But I did have contact with Carl Marcy in the Senate, the Fulbright Committee in
                    the Senate [Editor's Note: the Senate Foreign Relations Committee], and I had
                    contact with many people in IIA, particularly in the Voice. I had contact with
                    many knowledgeable citizens from diverse countries, all of whom had the one and
                    pure solution to the problem. So at the end, I at least had exposure.</p>
                <p>We wrote the chapter of the report dealing with the subject of information,
                    propaganda, very much based on the necessity to present only the truth. It was
                    the only way to get the respect and confidence of the audience. If you weren't
                    truthful, you would be found out sooner or later. The report was written along
                    those lines. The committee accepted it, and I know that it was discussed with
                    the president and he accepted it, as well. So that was the first time I had some
                    reading on how the president himself felt about it.</p>
                <p>Then I came over to USIA. Ted Streibert, just about a week or so after he'd been
                    appointed, asked me to come and see him. I assumed that he wanted me to go over
                    this chapter of the report and discuss my views on it. He said, “Well, I've read
                    the report and I agree with it. Now, will you come help me do it?” That I had
                    not expected. So I went on leave of absence from CIA and became his
                    assistant.</p>
                <p>It became clear fairly soon that one of the problems with the Information Agency
                    was that it didn't have any information. It didn't have any information about
                    what the U.S. Government was doing, nor did it have any information about what
                    the Russians were doing. So I took a look at the first one, and I asked my
                    secretary, “Could you get me the NSC papers on India?” She looked blank, and I
                    said, “Well, why don't you go to the policy people. They'll have a copy of the
                    NSC documents.”</p>
                <p>She came back and told me that we did not have any of the NSC documents in USIA.
                    We had no way of knowing what the policy was. It turned out that the NSC
                    understood that we were riddled with communists and shouldn't—and couldn't—have
                    the documents.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I talked to Bobby Cutler (General Robert Cutler, head of the NSC staff for the
                    president), who had been one of the members of the Jackson Committee. As a
                    special dispensation, he agreed that I could see the documents and, a little
                    later, that the documents could come to me in USIA. I had to set up a special
                    file and only I had access to it. It took a year before we were able to
                    establish a routine for regular access to these policy papers by the policy
                    staff. That is, I think, an example of how far behind the eight ball we were
                    when USIA started.</p>
                <p>The second problem was, “What is the enemy doing?” or “What are the neutrals or
                    the other countries thinking?” of which we knew nothing. We persuaded Ted
                    Streibert to set up the Office of Research and Intelligence.</p>
                <p>There had been an embryo of such activities in the Voice of America for some
                    time. I found three exceedingly interesting people in that organization. One is
                    here tonight, Lou Olom. He is the one who was doing mostly intelligence. There
                    was [Ross] Newpher, who was “the librarian,” but he was much more than that. He
                    was the only one who had files. He was the only one who could tell you anything
                    about anything. He was an excellent gentleman. The third was an eccentric genius
                    by the name of Leo Crespi, who was the public polling person, an excellent
                    professional.</p>
                <p>So the first thing we tried to do was to find out what the Europeans thought
                    about America and Russia; for example, whether they wished to be “red or dead,”
                    in the words of those times. We had simultaneous public opinion surveys, done in
                    four or five of the countries in West Europe. We got the answers back and
                    compared Germany to France, to England, to Italy, and so forth. It was pretty
                    interesting information. Not particularly hopeful information, but it was
                    significant.</p>
                <p>So I showed it to Ted Streibert, and Ted said, “I'm going over to the White House
                    for my monthly meeting with the president. Come along with me and give him this
                    information.”</p>
                <p>So we went over, and the president was very cordial. Ted said that I was there
                    and perhaps he'd be interested in the information. So the president looked at
                    me, and I started on my little spiel. As I was talking, he turned sideways and
                    was rocking in his chair, sort of looking out the window, had his glasses in his
                    mouth, and pretty soon his eyes were half-closed. I thought, “Oh, my God, what
                    do I do now?” But I kept going and finished it.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>He just kept rocking, his eyes were closed, and there wasn't anything else for me
                    to say. I suppose it really was only a few seconds, but it seemed a millennium.
                    Suddenly he turned around and he took his glasses out of his mouth, opened his
                    eyes, and started asking questions. He had remembered just about every figure I
                    had given him. And it was a very interesting discussion, because the basic
                    thrust of the information was that the Italians would rather be “red than dead.”
                    They really didn't want us to use nuclear weapons, if push came to shove. There
                    was no question that the majority, varying amounts of majority, but the majority
                    of all of the countries felt that way.</p>
                <p>The thing that fascinated me was his interest in the subject and his ability to
                    absorb figures and analyze them as rapidly as he did, and clearly, the
                    importance he placed on “public opinion.”</p>
                <p>The third time I had contact—not with Eisenhower directly, but indirectly—was
                    when I was in the executive office of the president right after Sputnik (1957),
                    working for Jim Killian (Science Adviser to the President). Here again, we had a
                    major problem of what to do with information. America was in shock, thinking the
                    Russians were better technically than we were. “We were coming apart, we were no
                    good, we were about to be overrun,” all of which was not true. I observed how
                    the president reacted to that, how he felt about it, again saying nothing but
                    the truth, and he was annoyed every time anyone in his administration oversold
                    the future. “We are going to launch tomorrow and it's going to be great,” they
                    would announce. Of course, it was launched the next week, and it collapsed.
                    Every time that happened, he got really very annoyed. But he stuck to his guns,
                    saying nothing but the truth, and letting the real world catch up.</p>
                <p>The fourth and last time was when Abbott and I went up to see him in Gettysburg
                    in 1967, because we thought it would be a marvelous time to reminisce and get in
                    some depth his feelings on subjects of importance and interest to the
                    Information Agency. I put down some notes afterwards which rambled, as the
                    conversation did. I tried to summarize some of his thoughts in somewhat coherent
                    paragraphs.</p>
                <p>He opened the meeting by saying that he felt that the whole world was really only
                    concerned with the U.S. and the USSR, who was ahead or would be ahead. That was
                    all they cared about. Everything was looked at through that prism.</p>
                <p>He then went on, again without much questioning from either Abbott or me, that he
                    was concerned about the low priority that this government had given information
                    activities. To him it was as it used to be in the Army before World War I or II,
                    when intelligence was in a low priority, and we had a colonel in charge of
                    intelligence. He had had to rely on British intelligence when he first went to
                    SHAPE. He felt that the information side was now being neglected in the same
                    way, and that it deserved much more.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Another example he used was that he felt that the neglect of information now was
                    as serious as the neglect of the military in 1913 and 1939, which is about as
                    strong a neglect as you could have. He also said that he had testified in 1945
                    before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in support of information activities.
                    He told them that it was woefully low and that he recommended that the budget be
                    at least $750 million. That was in 1946 or '47 dollars.</p>
                <p>Later on, he used another analogy of the many hundreds of billions that we had
                    spent on the military and foreign aid, and he felt that it would have been much
                    better if at least 5% of that money had been spent on the information dealing
                    with these issues. He was really quite annoyed at, for example, the U.N., where
                    everybody stood up and said America was no good, and where all the people or
                    governments to which we gave all kinds of things never mentioned it to their own
                    people. He felt the American government ought to do much more on that
                    subject.</p>
                <p>We then had an interesting and somewhat confused discussion on the subject of the
                    “official voice.” I'm sure some of you who were around then remember that the
                    president kept saying there should be a special broadcast time for the “official
                    voice” of the government, that would be truthful and authentic and believed. We
                    kept having difficulty as to just how to do that. Did it mean the rest of the
                    VOA program was untruthful? How did you get the audience to understand what you
                    meant? He had some interesting words on that. He said that what he meant by
                    “official voice” was a voice that was true, trustworthy, not propaganda or
                    entertainment. By definition, the Voice of America must be factual. Everything
                    must be provable and open to the world to see. Now, we certainly believe that,
                    in so far as the news is concerned, but there obviously are other necessary
                    parts of programming that cannot live up to that standard, because you must get
                    into the subject of opinions and the diversity of opinions. We raised that with
                    him, as well.</p>
                <p>One of Eisenhower's own statements later on showed that he was thinking of things
                    other than just the “official voice.” It was clear that he did not have the
                    highest regard for the press. He felt that they were more interested in making
                    headlines and getting more pay. He felt very strongly that we should not feel
                    squeamish—that, I believe, was his word—about trying to influence foreign press
                    people or radio or television people; that that was one of our functions.
                    Anything you could get the local media to do would be more effective than what
                    the Americans did. Now, I believe that's true of many things, but, again, it
                    doesn't tie in with the “official voice.”</p>
                <p>We also asked Eisenhower a few questions on how he felt about RFE, not what the
                    programs were, but what the funding was, which, of course, as we all know, at
                    that point was covert. Was that the right thing to do? News was just breaking
                    publicly that it had been covert. He said Frank Wisner had come to him and said
                    that the cover was good, it would not be broken, and that he felt that it was so
                    important that RFE have credibility; he therefore made the exception to allow it
                    to continue to be funded covertly.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Then, rather unkindly, we asked him about the U-2. He said, “Well, again, I was
                    told that there was no possible way that the plane or Mr. Powers would survive.
                    They urged me not to make a statement. I didn't want to, but I finally made the
                    statement. The one thing I refused to do after Khrushchev opened everything, was
                    to apologize to Khrushchev for what I had done in defense of the United States.
                    It was necessary to do and it had to be done.”We then raised the point of
                    dissent to U.S. policy. How should the Information Agency handle dissent, of
                    which there was plenty? He was really quite strong on this and felt it very
                    personally. He said, “The president has the responsibility. It is wrong to give
                    the same weight to people who do not have the responsibility, who criticize the
                    action, whatever it may be.” We went back and forth on that and pointed out that
                    we had to at least mention there was dissent. We had to give the thinking behind
                    the dissent and the nuances from different sides. He finally said, “Yes, I can
                    see that. You have to. But it is important that when you do, you clearly
                    emphasize who has what responsibility, and that it is wrong to equate everybody
                    as being equal. The president has more responsibility than anybody else, more
                    than any single senator.” He mentioned a few particular names. “More than any
                    Cabinet member, more than anybody else. And that should be made crystal-clear
                    when you are discussing dissent.” He was emphatic on that subject.</p>
                <p>The reason he finally agreed that USIA should discuss dissent, was that it was
                    probably the best way for foreigners to understand the American system of
                    government. In this way, foreigners would see that ours was a government that
                    would permit open dissent.</p>
                <p>He followed that statement up with another story. Marshal Zhukov had come over on
                    a visit shortly after the war. Eisenhower described him as the only good
                    communist he had ever met. Apparently Time magazine had a different opinion of
                    him. In any case, Marshal Zhukov was annoyed at the article that Time had run
                    about him. He asked the president to ban Time. The president said, “I
                    can't.”</p>
                <p>“What do you mean?” said Zhukov.</p>
                <p>“I can't, and it would be wrong. I can't ban any magazine or censor any other
                    publication about anything they say. In fact, Mr. Marshal, it is for the freedom
                    of the press that we went to war.” He said at the end he still didn't think
                    Zhukov understood it or believed it. [General laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We then brought up coordination. How do you get the impact of information into
                    policy-making before the fact? He readily agreed that it should be done, but he
                    said he knew of no one way of doing it. He felt the way that he tried to operate
                    was about as good as any; that the way he chose was to try to get all the people
                    involved in a particular decision together in one room and let them argue with
                    each other. He would sit and listen and agree with this one, disagree with that
                    one, in his own mind, without saying it. Then when everyone had said their
                    piece, he would either make his decision there and then, or, if necessary, say,
                    “I'll think about it,” and go out and play golf or go on a boat or do something
                    while thinking about it. Then when he had made his decision, he would announce
                    it, and that was that. He felt strongly that the information dimension should be
                    one of the voices heard in such a discussion.</p>
                <p>Should USIA be heard, or should the State Department speak for it? Eisenhower
                    said he felt very strongly that the State Department was meant to make policy,
                    but it couldn't run anything. [General laughter] Therefore, USIA should clearly
                    be an independent agency and speak with its own voice. He also felt that the
                    organization that had existed when he was president—the NSC and the OCB
                    [Operations Coordinating Board], which was meant to be the deputies coordinating
                    the policies and execution of the policies made by the wise NSC—was only a dance
                    on a toadstool and never really worked. But he did feel, for example, that if
                    the Kennedys had had the OCB and had used it, we would not have had the Bay of
                    Pigs.</p>
                <p>Eisenhower felt, again, when it comes to policy, he said, “People get mad at me,
                    annoyed with me, because I keep going back to the Constitution and the
                    fundamentals. I think that is what it's all about. The U.S. covets no territory,
                    does not wish to dominate any people, but desires to create a world community of
                    free nations at peace.” That was the principle against which he tried to put
                    proposals and policies.</p>
                <p>We then had a discussion of the problem of having both foreign and domestic
                    audiences, and how do you separate what you say to one from the other. Of
                    course, obviously, you can't. We started asking specific questions. For example,
                    I asked what did he think about the armed forces network in Germany. He said,
                    “That should be all right because they're only using one frequency.” I said,
                    “Oh, no, sir, they don't use one frequency; they use many frequencies because
                    they have radios all over Germany.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, I didn't know that. I can see then where that might be a problem
                    with the Germans as compared to our just entertaining our troops.” I found it
                    dismaying that he had thought it was just one frequency.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Another question we talked about was unconditional surrender. Again he said that
                    was a tough one, because domestically it was the right thing to do; it unified
                    the American people, gave them a clear goal. On the other hand, it unified the
                    German people and made their fight longer and more difficult for us. So there
                    was a direct dichotomy. He was also not particularly complimentary about how the
                    decision was made, sort of “spur-of-the-moment and off-the-cuff by one of our
                    presidents.”</p>
                <p>I asked Eisenhower another question. Abbott and I and others had tried to get him
                    to make a speech to the world on July Fourth, similar to the annual State of the
                    Union speech. He said, “There's no reason to do that. The State of the Union is
                    broadcast around the world.”</p>
                <p>We said, “Yes, that's true, but the State of the Union is written for the
                    Congress and the American people. Much of it is of some interest to the rest of
                    the world, but a lot of it is purely our own problems. What we were talking
                    about was a speech by you to the outside world about what are U.S. goals, what
                    are our policies, what are our abilities, what are our desires, what should we
                    be able to do together.”</p>
                <p>He said after a pause, “I hadn't thought about that. I think you may well have
                    been right. I may have been wrong. I know I was a world figure. I should have
                    perhaps used that more, but I was diffident. I didn't want to be too forward,
                    and I didn't do it.”</p>
                <p>Abbott said, “Well, you probably had the press of time.”</p>
                <p>The president said, “No, it wasn't a matter of time. I just didn't really realize
                    what you were talking about.” This again was the problem of keeping
                    communications opens, because we would send up papers and so forth; but it was
                    not like almost daily personal meetings with him of the kind Secretary Dulles
                    had.</p>
                <p>Other interesting things came out that were asides which you might be interested
                    in, but have nothing to do with information or USIA. Apparently [John F.]
                    Kennedy had talked to him about the Cuban missile confrontation. He felt that
                    Kennedy had been much too cautious. He had advised him not to make any promises
                    about never invading Cuba. He felt that Kennedy was not really at home in
                    foreign affairs, and that Kennedy didn't realize what Eisenhower believed to be
                    the truth, namely that the tougher you were on the Russians, the less likely
                    they were to make an attack on Berlin or any other place.</p>
                <p>On another subject, Eisenhower felt that membership in the Congress is not good
                    training for a president, because Congress is very good at being sure that
                    nobody has any responsibility. [General laughter] Your committee may, he said,
                    or somebody else may, but you don't. The president added, when you're brought up
                    and work hard at that, it is difficult to go into the Executive, where you have
                    to make the decisions and be accountable for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The last subject we touched on was Vietnam. He said he felt very strongly that
                    the idea of a gradual increase in the response was absolutely wrong, because if
                    you go up gradually, the other guy will go up gradually, too, and you just keep
                    right on escalating together. Once you decided to go, go with everything you're
                    got and go for broke. That is the way to do it, once you decide to go. Now,
                    whether or not you should go is a much more difficult issue than, in his words,
                    “I'll get my feet in just a little bit and just play around.” He said, “Whatever
                    you do, don't do that.”</p>
                <p>So as we said earlier today, Ike was an extraordinary man. Unlike his Secretary
                    of State, he believed strongly in public opinion and its impact on the world. I
                    think we were very lucky to serve during his time.</p>
                <p>Thank you.</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Henry, what a fascinating portrait. I forgot we asked all that stuff.
                    [General laughter] But I remember it was a great meeting.</p>
                <p>I want to thank everybody who worked on this Eisenhower Centennial symposium. We
                    had a wonderful committee of Tom Tuch, Bob Lincoln, Cliff Groce, Fred Coffey,
                    “Mim” [Miriam] Johnston, a whole lot of others. Everybody was so
                    enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>Frank Shakespeare had an episode, an incident, with Ike. Would you share that
                    with us, Frank?</p>
                <p>Comment by Frank Shakespeare</p>
                <p>My incident is a very small one compared to what we have heard earlier tonight.
                    But it may well be the final incident, completing the story of Eisenhower and
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>In November 1968, Richard Nixon was elected president. Around December, I was
                    designated his incoming USIA director. Eisenhower was then in Walter Reed
                    Hospital, and everybody knew he was dying. Unexpectedly I received an invitation
                    to visit him in the hospital. He was seeing some of Nixon's incoming officers
                    and talking with them. Thinking it would be a very brief visit, I went to his
                    hospital room. He was in a bed with the back tilted up, windows on either side,
                    in one of those white hospital gowns and flashing his big beaming smile as I
                    entered the room. An aide brought me in, sat me down, and left. So there were
                    just the two of us, Eisenhower and myself. What I thought was going to be a
                    courtesy meeting became an extensive briefing on USIA, its history, its vital
                    mission, its usefulness. I was astonished!</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>He said, “You know, I haven't felt it was appropriate for me to involve myself in
                    the last two presidencies (those, of course, being Kennedy and Johnson), because
                    of the party difference.” He continued, “You're going into one of the most
                    important jobs in the entire United States Government.” Then he talked about the
                    Agency for perhaps two hours. It simply stunned me that a president knew so much
                    about one agency. Later I realized that his interest in USIA was very, very
                    special.</p>
                <p>So that small incident may be the end of the story of Eisenhower and USIA. It
                    doesn't have the substance of other things you have heard tonight, but it's
                    interesting because it shows how he wanted to vet the USIA director in the new
                    administration and give him the direct benefit of his own experience and
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>A little anecdote. As you know, Nixon had decided to have Henry Kissinger as NSC
                    director, and Kissinger had decided to reduce formal NSC membership to five
                    people. The USIA director would only attend on an ad hoc basis. In my
                    conversation with Eisenhower, he mentioned something about NSC meetings. I said,
                    “Mr. President, I may not be at all NSC meetings. I will attend only by
                    invitation.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, no, no, no, no. You will be a member.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I believe the incoming NSC director has changed that.”</p>
                <p>Well, at that time it wasn't public about Henry [Kissinger]. Eisenhower said,
                    “Who's the new NSC director?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Henry Kissinger. It will be announced in a few days.”</p>
                <p>He stopped and said, “But Kissinger is a professor!” [General laughter] He
                    continued as if I wasn't in the room. “You ask professors to study things, but
                    you never put them in charge of anything.” [General laughter] “I have to call
                    Dick [Nixon]. I'm going to call Dick about that.”</p>
                <p>In closing, I thought you might like to know that this wise man who created USIA
                    was still trying to help and guide its people from a sick bed sixty days before
                    he died.</p>
                <p>Thank you.</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Thank you, Frank.</p>
                <p>What a wealth of stuff for the library out in Abilene! Jim Keogh now has some
                    thoughts about his relations with Ike.</p>
                <p>Comment by James Keogh</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>My memory goes back earlier to 1955. I was then a writer and editor at Time
                    magazine. We had been very much involved in the whole Eisenhower process, had
                    pushed him for president. After he was elected, we were a little worried. Was
                    this going to work? We didn't really decide so until 1955. For the cover of Time
                    that would be on the stands the Fourth of July 1955, we decided to do the
                    success cover. “This administration is working.” I was the writer on the
                    story.</p>
                <p>I came down to Washington to see the president. I went into the Oval Office, just
                    Jim Hagerty, the president, and myself. We sat and talked for about an hour. I
                    remember now, tonight, two of the questions I asked. The first one relates to
                    the man: “Mr. President, they are saying that you have turned the country
                    around. What do you have to say to that?”</p>
                <p>His answer was, “No man can turn this country around. If the country has turned
                    around, it's the people who have done it.”</p>
                <p>Another question I remember was, “Mr. President, domestic policy now, there seems
                    to be a strong consensus that it's working. But the foreign policy situation,
                    all of those questions are out there. We have this tremendous confrontation.
                    What are the keys to the solution of this enormous problem?”</p>
                <p>I remember part of his answer to that, and it stuck with me all the time since
                    then. “One of the most important things we must do,” he said, “is communicate to
                    the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe what this country is about,
                    who we are, what we have, what we do, how we feel, what we can do.” And I've
                    never forgotten that particular answer, because I think it relates very closely
                    to what all of us have tried to do over the years.</p>
                <p>One further note, Abbott. I think you ought to see to it that all of the current
                    and future directors, deputy director, and leaders of USIA have a tape of this
                    session tonight, so that they can have the benefit of this history and of the
                    memories that we are hearing.</p>
                <p>Thank you.</p>
                <p>WASHBURN: Thank you, Jim. We are going to do exactly that. We made an audiotape.
                    It will be edited. Tom Tuch has agreed to undertake the project. We will have it
                    in print and get it to the libraries around the country and to the present and
                    future operators of the agency. What you have said, Jim, fits very well into
                    what Arthur Larson sent me to read to all of you, because he couldn't be here. I
                    won't read it all, but you will see how it confirms what was said here by you
                    and Frank and Henry.</p>
                <p>Letter from Arthur Larson</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>“Eisenhower's conviction of the Agency's importance is best reflected in his
                    insistence that it must be a separate agency. Not only that, but its directors
                    should have the equivalent of cabinet rank so that he can deal with the
                    secretary of state on an equal plane, not as a subordinate.</p>
                <p>“Another indication of Eisenhower's belief in the Agency's importance is the fact
                    that shortly after my appointment, he asked me to take a half-hour to make a
                    presentation to the Cabinet on the USIA's work. The members were greatly
                    impressed and moved by heart-rending scenes in smuggled-out films from the
                    Hungarian revolution.</p>
                <p>“As to message and tone, Eisenhower said my number-one job was to ease tensions
                    with the USSR. He particularly wanted to reach the young people. I find this
                    note in my pocketbook quote: 'Offer unlimited access to America in exchange for
                    same as to publications, visitors, cultural, broadcasters, etc.'</p>
                <p>“Above all, USIA must stick to the truth. Its tone must be positive, not just
                    anti-communist. This may sound self-evident to the point of triteness now, but
                    it definitely was not so then. In view of the events of the past year, one is
                    entitled to conclude that he was more than thirty years ahead of his time.”</p>
                <p>LINCOLN: As president of the Alumni Association, I can only say thank you
                    immensely, Abbott, and thanks to everyone else who has been on the program here
                    for your contribution to the knowledge about the whys and wherefores and the
                    reason for being of the U.S. Information Agency. Thank you all and
                    goodnight.</p>
