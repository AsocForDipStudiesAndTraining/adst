<p>JOHN F. CORRELL</p>
<p>Interviewer:  Morris Weisz </p>
<p>Initial interview date:  March 9, 1990</p>
<p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Today is March 9, 1990, and this is a recording of the life and times in the Foreign Service Labor Attach� Corps of our friend John Correll.  His State Department history is recorded in its records; and what I want to interview him on today is his earlier background as well as how he came into the Labor Attach� field, his trade union and other work before then, and the specifics of what he did in the Foreign Service, with special reference to what he did as a Labor Attach� in various important posts in Western Europe where he served — Greece, Spain, and England.  Although, of course, if we have time, he should refer to the others outside of Western Europe.</hi>
</p>
<p>So, John, will you just take over at this point and tell us all you can?  John has had a bit of a difficult time with his health recently, but has nevertheless agreed to speak for the benefit of the Association for Diplomatic Studies' Labor Diplomacy Oral History Project.</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Thank you, Morris.  I'm delighted to see you and especially delighted to be able to relate some of my experiences as a Labor Attach�.  They represent the highlight of my life. I first came into contact with the labor movement through my grandfather who was a member of the Cigar Makers' Union.  He was a great admirer of Samuel Gompers.  He talked union a lot to me, but interestingly enough, he owned and operated a cigar factory.</p>
<p>I next came into contact with the labor movement after I'd graduated from Kenyon College, and went back to Mansfield, Ohio, where I taught school.  A union was being formed at the steel mill there — the United Steelworkers of America — and there I came into contact with its top leaders.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This would be in the late 1930's?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
<p>CORRELL:  This was in the late 1930's.  I served as the Educational Director of the local union and had the opportunity of meeting such great trade union leaders as Clinton S. Golden and especially my very best friend, Joseph Scanlon, who later became the Director of the Scanlon Plan.  He originated that plan at the steel mill where he was working.  He believed in cooperation rather than conflict.</p>
<p>Next, the trade union movement was given a place at the War Production Board by Mr. Roosevelt, who wanted it to have equal participation from industry, labor and management.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  John, may I interrupt for a moment?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, indeed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You said you were Educational Director of the local Steelworkers Union.  Is that while you were teaching?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, that was on the. . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That was a volunteer effort.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  That was a volunteer effort.  But I learned a great deal about the labor movement because of that, and I came in contact with the great leaders of the United Steelworkers of America, Harold Ruttenberg, for instance, and some of those people who later. . . .  As you know, Ruttenberg and Clint Golden collaborated on two or three wonderful books on industrial relations.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  To let the record be clear, you are referring to Harold Ruttenberg rather than his brother Stanley, who later was a prominent CIO staff member..</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  I knew his brother very well at the War Production Board (WPB), too.  After labor was invited to join the War Production Board as a member and a partner to offer its opinions on how labor could help during World War II, I worked in the WPB Manpower Division as a CIO appointee.  That was under Clinton Golden, but I also came into contact with Joseph Keenan of the AFL, who was in charge of the WPB's Labor Production Division. I learned a great deal about the trade union movement at that time and met many great labor economists, for instance David J. Saposs.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  John, let me interrupt you if I may.  The records will not indicate this because it is not directly relevant to the Foreign Service.  Both the AFL and the CIO had the right to designate Vice Chairmen of the WPB.  Clint Golden of the CIO was Vice Chairman for Manpower Requirements, and Joe Keenan was Vice Chairman for Labor Production.  That was an artificial difference because each worked on both functions.  Joe would concentrate on the AFL issues and Clint Golden on CIO issues.  In effect, John and I were working for both of these gentlemen.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well it was during that time, Morris, that I went to school at the American University at night and studied labor economics, the history of the labor movement, productivity, and other aspects of industrial relations.  Funny, at that particular time I had a friend at the State Department by the name of Cleon Swayzee, who knew a good bit about what was going on at the War Production Board.  He was recruiting several of the people who weren't directly from the labor movement but were very sympathetic to it and had a background in labor economics.  He offered me a job along with others — Otis Mulliken — to come over to the State Department and become a Labor Attach�.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This would be at the end of the War.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  This was 1945.  And Swayzee made it possible for me to go to South Africa, where I had some very interesting experiences not entirely connected with World War II, since South Africa was pretty much divorced at that time from what was going on in Europe, where the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine were under way.  So when I left South Africa, and I wish I could tell you about some of the interesting experiences I had there because that was the first time a Labor Attach� had ever been there, and I was the last Labor Attach�, because the Nationalist Party came into power in 1948.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  John, excuse me, I wouldn't want the record to be incomplete in that respect.  You were the last Labor Attach� assigned there for many years.  Later on people like McHale served as Labor Attach� there, but that was after a hiatus of many years.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes.  They disguised it with a particular terminology I think at that time.  I then transferred to Greece, and, as a little interlude, let me say that I was educated at Kenyon College, and, of all things, I had majored in Greek.  I knew the language pretty well.  I knew the history, I knew the drama, I knew the philosophy.  So I think providence had a hand there in getting me assigned to Greece.</p>
<pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
<p>Now as you know, Morris, the Marshall Aid Plan was then getting underway and it had a very good concept of labor, with many labor people in Washington advising them.  They recruited some of the best labor people that you could imagine.  For instance, Alan Strachan, our mutual friend, was sent to Greece, where he was head of the Labor Division of the Marshall Plan Aid Mission.  Fortunately we got along famously.  I had some of my tasks cut out for me, and he had his tasks cut out for him.  And we were able to carry them out together to the mutual advantage of our country's total objective there.  We both became very well known in the Greek trade union movement, which at that time had quite a reputation for fighting Communists, and Fotis Makris, who became quite a favorite of ours, and John Potsetcis (phonetic) and John Calamaris (phonetic) all became very friendly to us labor people.</p>
<p>Now we used to sponsor all kinds of activities, and Alan had quite a staff over there on productivity, apprenticeship, and so on.  And I maintained contact with the Ministry of Labor and the Greek labor movement.  And we participated in those great parades of those days. As you probably know, the Greeks will parade at the drop of a hat, and we had some very remarkable, impressive parades with the flags flying and the bands playing.  But that was on the surface.  Underneath it all, we were tussling with Communists, who were trying to infiltrate the trade union movement, and we beat them hands down, because we had the people who knew labor, knew the labor movement, and we had very willing people in the Greek labor movement who were our friends.  I was in Greece for about four years, and it was during that time that I used to go to Paris to conferences and meet many of my labor friends as well as other Labor Attach�s.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I want to interrupt you for a moment because I want you to cover one other matter. There are many countries we will be covering in which there was both an Embassy Labor Attach� and a US AID Mission labor man, and where there was frequently some conflict between them, especially if one came from one part of our labor movement and the other from the competing part.  You came from the Federation of Teachers, which was in the AFL, but you had been working with the CIO.  In any event . . .</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, but that did not occur in Greece, because Alan Strachan was from the United Automobile Workers, CIO.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But also — and I have known both of you. — I would say that your personalities are such that you were able to avoid conflicts.  What was the line of demarcation in your respective functions?  You were in the State Department.  He was in AID.  What was the demarcation between your two functions?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, primarily it was that Alan concentrated on training of the unions in apprenticeship, productivity issues, trade union accounting, and trade union organization. He had a staff of about seven pretty good people, who were specialists in those fields.  Now on my side. . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  John, I love you dearly.  Some of them were good, and some of them were less than good!  (laughter)</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, I speak only of the good ones.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Good, good.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  They were all great friends of mine; they were always welcome at the Embassy. I would take over, for instance, on Labor Day to give the Labor Day party, and we had a good man as our Ambassador, John Peurifoy, who understood labor very well.  And we invited the Greek unions to have a great celebration on our Labor Day.  And we always had good speakers, and that was a very mutually agreeable occasion in which we became very close friends.</p>
<p>Thank goodness I could speak a little Greek by that time.  I had been trained in Greek in college, but the Greek that they were speaking was modern Greek, and I was trained in ancient Greek.  I went to school at the State Department and took some courses in diplomacy, so I got along very well and could use the usual phrases.  One of the major things that I did there was to attend the labor conferences that they had.  They would bring in the trade unions, small and weak as they were, from the outlying areas in Greece. One of the strong places was Thessaloniki, where they had a good, strong trade union movement.</p>
<p>As you know, the Greeks are mariners and we had a very strong union of the mariners, which had its offices over in Piracus.  But to get back to your question, there was no problem of demarcation between our functions.  Alan and I both went to labor meetings.  I attended most of the meetings that he had over at the Marshall Aid Mission offices, and we got along very well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Let me see if I've got this correct for the purposes of future interviews.  There was no line of demarcation in your function in the sense of conflict, but generally the AID function was to train and help the trade unions, which was an admitted and encouraged part of both the Marshall Plan and the Greek-Turkish aid program, which existed even before the Marshall Plan.  Your job was as an Embassy official to keep the Embassy informed on the importance of the labor aspects of Greek society, to interpret what was happening in the labor field generally, not only in the trade union field?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, in general that's exactly what we did.  And I made many reports of course. I reported to the Embassy staff the major developments that were going on.  If Alan Strachan wanted to see the Minister of Labor, that was fine; if I wanted to talk to somebody in the labor movement, whom he was working with, that was fine.  So, in general, I don't think we could have had a better arrangement.  Now why was that?  That was probably because of our personalities and because we both wanted to build a strong Greek trade union movement, which we did.  And the Communists ultimately gave up on the labor movement in Greece.  I was in Greece approximately, as your dates will show, three and a half in the early 1950's.  I went there in 1948 and came back in 1952.  Now from there . . .  Unless there are other questions you would like to ask me about Greece, . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I remember meeting you in 1951 at the Labor Attach� Conference Paris.  We had a brief meeting, and that was the first time I met you in the Foreign Service.  We had, of course, been friends many years before that in the War Production Board.  No, that takes care of Greece very nicely.  Where did you go from there?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, I got a base on balls, as I put it.  I went to Spain, and that gave me a very unusual opportunity to study the structure of an industrial relations kind of cooperation that they had between management and labor under a dictator, Franco.  Franco was not so harsh as many people thought at that time, because labor and industry worked very, very well together.  By that time I had picked up enough Spanish, and I also had an assistant who later became an assistant to the Spanish Labor Attach� in the United States.  I learned a great deal about northern Spain where industry was predominantly in steel and ship-building.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now you succeeded whom?  Do you remember who it was who was there before you?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, there had been someone, but I can't recall who it was.  But he had gotten along very well, and by that time, we had developed the outlines of what a Labor Attach� does.  He observes the developments in the industrial relations field, particularly from the labor point of view, and he reports to the State Department, and he also reports to the Embassy staff and the Ambassador.  And I was there at a time when we had some wonderful Ambassadors.  Jimmy Dunn was one of the Ambassadors, and he was a fine gentleman, who understood the need for labor development, the need of a relationship between industry and labor, so that production could proceed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Excuse me.  Was it Smith Simpson who was in Spain before you?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No, he was in Belgium.  He preceded me in Greece, by the way.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We'll be talking to Simpson.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, I'm sure you will.  He got along quite well in Greece, but Simpson was a very nervous man, and he worked very hard, and sometimes he worked himself a little bit too hard.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In any event, he was one of the people we will be interviewing who did not come from the labor movement and had a good appreciation of its importance?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  As you well pointed out, I did not come directly from our labor movement. The week before I went to Washington, I was elected President of the American Federation of Teachers in Mansfield, Ohio, but I never got to serve very long.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  By the way, how did you happen to know Cleon Swayzee?  He was not a trade unionist himself.  He was covering labor in the State Department.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes.  I got to know Cleon because he was a professor of Greek, and secondly he was a great friend of my girl in Cincinnati. (laughter) As you know, he was an inestimable gentleman, a very fair-minded man, and in every way very helpful in getting me started.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did he arrange for you to be appointed Labor Attach� just to get you out of the country?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  (laughter) No, but I do want to repeat that it was a great experience to serve in the kind of dictatorship I saw in Spain.  From there, of course, I went to a hard post down in Havana, Cuba.  At that particular time, Castro was out of jail and operating down in Santiago de Cuba.  The dictator and President Batista was doing some strange things in order to protect his position, but they did not help him one bit.</p>
<p>But the labor movement in Cuba had a good arrangement with the Government.  I use the word “good.” They had a close arrangement with Batista.  Eusebio Mujal was a skilled labor leader, and there was a strong labor movement in Cuba, as you probably know.  By that time, I could speak enough Spanish to get along very well, and I attended conferences at the Confederation of Labor there, and I learned a lot about the sugar workers.  That was the important union at that particular time, although there were a number of craft unions which were also important.  Well, when Castro took over in . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Before Castro took over, the AFL had a representative, who went there frequently, Serafino Romualdi.  What were your relations with Romualdi?  What did he do, and what did you do?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
<p>CORRELL:  They were good.  He came down and would advise the union leaders there on certain aspects of their relationships with US labor.  But he didn't come to the Embassy a great deal.  That was not because he didn't want to have a close relationship with the Embassy, but he didn't want to be known as having such a close relationship.  He was an independent agent of the AFL, and he would advise Eusebio Mujal on certain aspects of making the ties between the Cuban labor movement and the American labor movement close. And they were close; there was a good deal of mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Well, when Castro came into power, everybody thought he was going to be a very good boy. He wasn't a good boy at all.  It only took about four months before Che Guevara and his brother Raul had him moving very quickly . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Castro's brother Raul, not Che's.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Castro's brother Raul, not Che's brother, no.  Castro's brother, Raul, who was really a dedicated Communist.  I think Castro was not that dedicated, but he did not care for the United States, and probably that had a lot to do with his feelings.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think Castro admitted a few months after he came into power that his objective was Communism in his country.  He hadn't admitted that before.  Were you still in the country when that happened, or had you already gone?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No.  His appointments at first were non-Communists, but when they found out what was happening, many of them left.  Some of them were executed later on, and some of them came over to Miami.  As you know, Castro was supported by a great many intellectuals, by the professional class, and when they realized what was happening, then there was a total migration of that group of people over to Miami.  Preceding him had been the Batisianos who knew that for them the game was up; and then, later on, was when the Mariel people came in, so we had three great waves of Cubans coming into Miami.</p>
<p>Well, that was a great experience.  I did not get out very much.  I attended two or three of the sugar mill refinery workers' conferences, but that was a period when you had to be very careful.  Bombs were being set off.  The bombs were being set off at that wonderful nightclub in Havana called the Tropicana and people were hurt.  So that was a very tricky business as you know.  Batista left.  He really wasn't pushed out by a coup.  He just left and went away, and Castro came in and celebrated.  I was in Havana the night that he came in, and he had his little son on one of the tanks with him, but he soon forget his little son, and nobody heard very much about him after that.  Well, I left . . .</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Before you conclude telling us Cuba, as I gather you're prepared to do now, we've been going about a half hour and I want to shift the tape to the other side.  So let's just say that this is the first complete tape, and it refers to your career as a Labor Attach� from the beginning until you left Havana de Cuba.  Thank you, John.  Hold on a second. Now, after leaving Cuba, you were assigned to another post where you quickly absorbed the language, namely London!.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  All right, Morris.  Now is the time when I came into full bloom as a Labor Attach�.  I had served in several different countries and knew the field from several aspects. And London, of course, was another expression of what I believe was the Hand of Providence.  Educated at Kenyon College, I had read everything from “Beowulf” right down to Thomas Hardy by that time, so when I got to London, I was well prepared with British history and literature as well as the background of the British trade union movement, which I had studied along the way and which I knew quite a bit about.  And when I got to London, of course . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This was the beginning of the 1960's?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Just the beginning.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And whom did you succeed?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Joseph Godson.  Now Joseph Godson was a man who was directly from the American trade union movement.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, he wasn't of course.  He was associated with unions through various organizations, political and economic organizations, but as I recall, his work with the trade unions was chiefly in political work and with the Jewish Labor Committee.  Unfortunately, as you may not know, Joe died a couple of years ago.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No, I did not know that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So we won't be able to get his contribution.  He had an interesting history himself, but. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Very interesting.  My understanding was that he was very close to many of the leaders of American trade unions.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, very close, but as far as I know he was never himself an official of an American trade union.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No, he was not.  But, in any case, Joe left his good marks in London.  He had been pretty close to the British Trade Union Congress in some aspects.  He looked upon it a little bit more politically than I did.  I looked upon it as educational and economic and some politics, too.</p>
<p>Well, you can imagine going from a smaller Embassy to a place like London, and I think at that time there were something like 600 staff members at the Embassy in London.  It was the old Embassy there on Grosvenor Place.  I had a very nice office; we had a very nice Ambassador, John Hay Whitney, who understood a great deal about labor and was very sympathetic to labor.  And so I had no trouble in England in getting started.  I knew the role of a Labor Attach�, as did the British labor movement and the British Government, the Minister of Labour — all knew my role.</p>
<p>As you know, Harold MacMillan came into power then; the Labour Party had just been voted out of power.  So you had a different approach to labor relations and industry at that particular time.  But I made my contacts immediately with the trade union people, the Trade and Labour Council, and I made many friends in British labour, especially Vic, whom you probably know.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Vic Feather.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Vic Feather was known to everybody in the American trade union movement. (laughter) One of the aspects of my work in London was to be George Meany's escort officer when he would come through London on his way to the annual ILO Conference.  So I got to know George Meany quite well, as well as Mrs. Meany, whom he usually brought with him; and we had some good times.  I hosted a luncheon for George Meany at the Embassy and by that time David K.E. Bruce was the Ambassador.  Of course, Morris, you know David Bruce was one of the best Ambassadors we've ever had.  He understood labor very well.  He was very supportive of the whole labor program.  Our labor program there was primarily one of contacts and reporting.  We were in touch with many of the unions there, especially the miners.  We were very fond of the miners, and then Lord Cooper's union was a favorite.  I always went to their conferences.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Lord Cooper was with which union?  Transport and General?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No, that was the biggest union at that particular time. No, it was a rather large union and it organized some transport people, but mostly workers in various kinds of fields. It was a general union.  I wish I could give you more detail on that.</p>
<pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's all right.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  I went to their conference.  But always I had the unusual opportunity there to be with other Labor Attach�s.  There was the Swedish Labor Attach�, the French Labor Attach�, the German Attach�, and we had our luncheons once a month.  We exchanged ideas and information; and we exchanged good fellowship.  We all felt we were an unusual breed because we were dealing in a field which was somewhat new even at that particular time. The Labor Attach� program didn't get started really until after World War II as you know, Morris.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  One of the things we're going to be looking at is the problem the Labor Attach� had when there was a higher official in the Embassy who had a similar background.  Now you were not there when Phil Kaiser was our Minister at the Embassy?.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No, I was not.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We will be developing with other people the problems that a Labor Attach� has when the Ambassador or the DCM or somebody above him has his own trade union connections as you know Phil did.  And Phil will be supplying some information on that.  Who was the DCM when you were in London under Whitney?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  It was an old line Foreign Service officer.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I see.  So you had none of those problems.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No problems at all.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there an AID program still there?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No, there was no AID program there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But there was an information program?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  There was an information program, and McHale was looking after that.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh that's right!</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  And we got along famously as you know.  Ed was my kind of a man and he worked with me on our “Labor Bulletin” and it turned out to be one of the best that was written.  I don't know if you've ever see it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, I used to get it regularly.  And this was after Gausmann left as the Information Officer?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, well Bill Gausmann was there when I was there, and we got along very well.  We each had our beat.  We each had our responsibilities, and we collaborated on many occasions and Bill Gausmann was a very good friend of mine.  In Britain I became pretty well acquainted with the miners up in Durham and [went to] their annual gala.  One time there were a hundred thousand miners at the gala in Durham.  And Sam Watson, who became particularly close to the Americans and was a good friend of the Ambassador, was the great trade union leader then.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you know that Sam's daughter married Joe Godson's son?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  I wouldn't be surprised, wouldn't be surprised.  Sam was a great man.  I'd go up there on Sunday afternoon, and they were very religious people, as you know, Morris.  The miners were religious and they held services.  And they were eager for education.  They had their educational conferences, and so on.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They didn't have any desire to hide their relationships with the Americans.  Some of the trade unions in my experience were a little bit worried about seeming to be too close to the Americans, but none of that existed with the miners as far as I could tell.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Oh no.  Your experience varies from mine.  Several of the unions came to me to ask me if I could get them in touch with their American fellow-unionists.  But, of course, they were old hands at the ILO, and each year they sent delegates to the ILO, and they always sent two delegates to the AFL-CIO conventions.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Similarly the AFL sent delegates to the British TUC Congresses.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  And there was that wonderful exchange.  It was always my job to be on hand, to be of help to our delegates in any way I could to arrange for them to have lodging if I could, and to do anything I could to facilitate their work by easing their path, even the housekeeping details.</p>

<p>My reporting there [in London] also was interesting.  I had an assistant, and we scanned about twelve papers each day looking for labor news and finding out from those papers if there was anything going on up in Belfast or down in Wales or in other parts of Britain. Labor problems became accentuated there for a while when the Labour Party left, because the Labour Party acted a little paternalistically toward the unions, but they stood on their feet after they got used to Harold MacMillan, “Marvelous Mac,” who was the author of The Winds of Change.  Mac was not at all uninformed about labor unions, and he had very good Ministers of Labour.  When I was there, I was close to one Minister of Labour who later got in trouble with a Hyde Park lady named Christine Keeler.  It became, of course, a story all over the world. .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was he a Labour Minister?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, he was the Labour Minister.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, my Lord.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  That became quite a famous case (laughter) as you well know.  I had four years in London and with my British schooling at the Episcopal School of Kenyon College, I had a great opportunity to do more than take care of my labour work, which kept me pretty busy.  I knew the people; I knew the personalities; I knew the history of the British labour movement very well.  My chief job was to interpret for the Embassy what was going on in the labour field.  Now you would think that in an Embassy that large you would come into conflict with other people who had a marginal interest in labor.  For instance, the Agricultural Attach� had an interest in labor because of the agricultural workers.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Also the political officer who covered the Labour Party.  Later on that became an issue as to who should cover the Labour Party as against the labor unions.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, it was no issue when I was there.  My turf was the trade union movement. Now that impinged occasionally on the Labour Party, but I was strictly the man who went to the trade union halls.  But there was always that matter of the political officer who was interested in labor as an important factor in the political scene, and the Commercial Attach� who was interested in prices, exports and imports, and things of that kind.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you ever in your career in any of these posts have a function related to advising American business about operating on the labor aspects of their functions in the country?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
<p>CORRELL:  Only in South Africa.  There they had an American Chamber of Commerce, and many of the American businessmen down there had never heard of a Labor Attach�.  But I had close friends in that group, and I spoke to them on the history of our labor movement.  I spoke to them about the developments in the post-World War II era, the Taft-Hartley Bill, for instance.  But never did I advise them as to investments or anything of that kind.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They didn't raise any questions about how you set a salary level, and what you did in such matters?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's interesting, because my experience in India was directly the opposite.  I was always being asked by businessmen who wanted to do business there, “What do I have to do? Where do I go?  Where do I. . .”</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  In labor?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh yes.  How do you determine wages and things like that?  That's interesting.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, the American businessman [in South Africa] was sophisticated and had been there quite a long time.  New businesses were coming in, but they had very little trouble in that connection because the guidelines were pretty well set.  I might say as an interesting aspect of my work in South Africa, I was the Labor Attach� and I was just learning my job, and there was a strike of the miners, a short strike, and of course that scares everybody in South Africa.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Gold miners?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  These were gold miners; the diamond miners never struck.  But I must say that I learned two things.  That I shouldn't be too curious about what's going on in the field.  I went out to see what was happening and the police picked me up very quickly.  I had been studying Afrikaans and talked my way out of that.  They wanted to know what I was doing out there, and I'd better get back to my home base which I did.  And then I got it a second time because the Chief of Mission said, “What in the world, Correll, are you doing out there? You're here to observe, not to participate.”</p>
<pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
<p>When I was there [in South Africa], there was another interesting aspect of the assignment. Alan Paton became a close friend of mine.  Alan went off to America, and I supplied him with a lot of background information.  And while in America, he wrote that wonderful book, Cry, the Beloved Country.  I met many of the young liberals in Parliament at that time including Helen Suzman.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Really?  I met her in Australia.  She came to visit Ed McHale while we were there.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, Ed became quite a good friend of hers, too.  And Helen is now a famous lady throughout the world.  This summer she has resigned.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you see her on “Nightline” being interviewed about Mandela the other night?</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Yes, I did.  She was a teacher at the University of Witwatersrand.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I really don't want to keep you any longer, but I do want to ask you one other question, and that is, you left England at the age of 60, and retired.  I'll have some comments on forced retirement from the State Department, but that's something else.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, mine wasn't really forced.  I looked forward to it.  And I was given the opportunity to be a consultant, but I was tired.  I'd had a very wonderful experience as a Labor Attach�.  It broadened my whole philosophical outlook on life and the various elements in life and the need for . . .  I had a completely great philosophical approach to humanity and so on.  Now I'll answer any questions you have.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well I have one question.  There's no indication for sure that in an important country like England that we ever considered doing away with the job of the Labor Attach�.  But in other countries of less importance to the United States, there has been a tendency to combine the job of Labor Attach� with others which automatically means that the Labor Attach� spends less time on labor than he ordinarily would. Do you have comments about the general value to the Embassy of having a person with those commitments, with that background, and those interests as a State Department staff member?  I would like to get any specific instances of where your particular labor background was of help, not only to the trade union movement of the United States or in the country to which you were assigned, but also of value to the Embassy in doing its job.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
<p>For example, today in the Soviet Union, there's no doubt about the fact that somebody there has to be covering the development of these newly burgeoning trade union organizations that have relationships with free movements rather than the Communist movement.  We'll be facing that issue now, and if you have any comments about it. . . .</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Well, Morris, I've tried to keep up as well as I could with the developments, but the changes have been too fast for me.  Now I'd say off hand that in certain parts of Africa, it would be important to have Labor Attach�s particularly to inform the Embassy of the need for being closer to the people and to know something about their organizations for mutual protection with whatever comes into being.  But change is the only universal thing in life. You know, I've been away now twenty-five years.  I don't get the “Monthly Labor Review” anymore.  I still get the “AFL-CIO News” and I'm not qualified . . .  (End Side A, Tape I)</p>
<p>Beginning Tape II, Side B</p>
<p>CORRELL:  It is also, I think, fascinating to consider and ponder the fact that many Labor Attach�s have become Ambassadors.  And that's because of their broadened knowledge of the entire field.  People sometimes think labor attach�s are pretty narrow.  Well, their field is somewhat narrow, but they have to have a very broad outlook on the situation.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm glad you mentioned that.  That's very important.  We're doing a special listing of people who came out of the Labor Attach� field who became ambassadors like Ambassadors Stephansky, Low, and Cohen.  Well thanks very much, John.  I'm going to cut this short at this point.  I think I may have tired you too much.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  Morris, I never get tired talking about labor.  And trade unions!</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Thanks very much.</hi>
</p>
<p>CORRELL:  And thank you very much for including me.  I wish your whole program great success.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Thanks very much, John.</hi>
