                <p>Career Beginnings Before Entrance into USIA</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, what was your career before coming into USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: As a news director in Portland, Maine, I was anxious sooner or later to
                    get out of that small environment and move to Washington. It seemed to me that
                    would be the place where any opportunities might be available. In 1946 I had
                    been instrumental in the foundation of the Radio and Television News Directors
                    Association, although at that time we left the TV out; it was just NARND. We
                    founded that in Cleveland in 1946, not knowing whether anyone would attend that
                    first convention or not. As it happened, about 75 people showed up, and we had a
                    respectable group to found the organization, which has since grown into a major
                    organization. So I was not unknown in the broadcasting industry, as a result of
                    NARND, and I thought it was a good time to put a few ads in broadcast magazines,
                    which brought a minimal amount of responses. I got fed up with waiting and
                    decided to go down on my own hook and found a news bureau reporting from
                    Washington, primarily for New England radio stations.</p>
                <p>Catching on With VOA</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In the course of this, I had filed application with virtually every important
                    news organization operating in America, including VOA, from which I got the
                    first expression of interest. They started a security clearance process, which I
                    thought was a good idea, except that the VOA at that time was located in New
                    York City, and I wasn't particularly interested in working at that point in New
                    York. For a newsman who has to free-lance a lot, Washington is the most sensible
                    place to be anyway. The very day before I was to leave, I got a telegram from
                    New York offering me a position as a special events officer with the Worldwide
                    English operation. I couldn't take that, having lined up six radio stations to
                    report to from Washington, so I got on the phone and said: “I'm sorry about
                    that; I wish I could but I can't. I have to go to Washington”. They said, “Well,
                    wait a minute; we've just started a bureau there”. Mort Glatzer was in charge
                    with Sidney Sulkin as his deputy, and a third guy named Harold Queen. They had
                    very fine people, but they had no real radio expertise. It was suggested that I
                    get in touch with Glatzer, and since I already had security clearance, he might
                    be able to find something for me to do — which is what happened. I began doing
                    daily five-minute newscasts at 3 o'clock, writing and voicing them live, as a
                    WAE. Following the news was an interview or feature to fill out the 15 minute
                    slot we had from Washington — what was called “the back half”. And that's how I
                    happened to get a job permanently. You know what Woody Allen says, that 80% of
                    success in any organization is just showing up. And I showed up every day at one
                    o'clock and finished up a little after three. Television was coming on the scene
                    very rapidly. The smaller radio stations didn't have a huge reservoir of money
                    with which to go into TV, and they were making cuts all over the place. So I
                    lost a couple of my radio stations, and I could see ahead that the going would
                    be kind of tough. So instead of going after new stations, I just let the ones I
                    still had peter out. Every one of them sooner or later went into television. I
                    was on WAE from August, 1948 to May of 1949 before going on staff full-time.</p>
                <p>Secretary Acheson Addresses Malaysia</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The Washington Bureau responded to queries and requests for material from New
                    York, both the English operation and the language desks. We covered the Hill and
                    State Department. I remember Dean Acheson did spots once in a while. I remember
                    a rather amusing incident in connection with that. We were going to start
                    broadcasting in Malay, the language of the newly independent Malaysia, and they
                    wanted a statement from the Secretary of State. I arranged through a guy in Linc
                    White's shop to get it. He asked me to send over a piece of copy, so I sat down
                    and wrote what I considered appropriate for Acheson to say in a minute and a
                    half or so, and sent it over. Suddenly, I got a call from some middle level guy
                    in the State Department, whose countries included the new Malaysia, and he said
                    he wanted to see that copy. So, I sent another copy over, and of course, he sat
                    on it. I'd call every now and then, and he said, “We're checking it, and there
                    are certainly some changes that'll have to be made.” Unbeknownst to me, the
                    original copy was already on the Secretary's desk. Suddenly I got a call,
                    asking, can you be over here at 4 o'clock? The Secretary will be ready to record
                    the statement you sent over. I got Tom Hodges, the engineer, and we went over
                    and set up in an anteroom outside Acheson's office. The Secretary read it over
                    and said, “That's fine”, and he read it as it was. The next day I got a call
                    from this guy at State, and he said, “About that statement, I've got a few
                    changes which I can. read to you over the phone.” I said, “Oh, yesterday
                    afternoon we recorded the Secretary with that statement.” This was followed by
                    dead silence. I said, “He approved it after it had been on his desk all this
                    time. It's normal to go through the Public Affairs office. I'm sorry if you
                    don't like it, but I don't think it's going to make much of a difference”.</p>
                <p>I remember when the Arabic service started, and we got a statement from the
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. And I recall Harry Truman
                    making a Christmas message, and we went over to the White House with an old
                    Magnavox; they weighed a ton, you know, in two parts, and we recorded Truman and
                    sent it to New York on the line. You remember we had a full time line between
                    the Interior penthouse and New York.</p>
                <p>Staff Transfers. Budget Shortages. and Move From New York toWashington Cause
                    Severe Disruptions</p>
                <p>Mort Glatzer, who was the number one man, moved up to the information program
                    headquarters at 1778 Pennsylvania Avenue, which left Sid Sulkin in charge. Then
                    Sid went up there too, and I fell into the job. With budget, RIFs and that kind
                    of thing, and New York didn't have much sympathy for saving anything going on in
                    Washington. We figured it was kind of short-sighted that they should take that
                    attitude, but when budget cuts came around, we'd get practically wiped out. In
                    '53 Jack Vebber was program manager in New York, later PAO in Rio and Santiago,
                    I think a real Latin America hand. We had to save something on the staff, and I
                    was able to get Bill McCrory and Bob Redeen on WAE by appealing to Vebber. They
                    stayed on WAE for quite a long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I was sent to New York in early '54 just to keep things going, since they had
                    RIFed so many people — perhaps a lot of them because the move to Washington was
                    already in the wind. I would go up during the week, and Ned Roberts, who later
                    became area director for Africa, went up with me and worked in the policy
                    office. The head of the Voice at that point was Doc Morton, former NBC
                    executive, I think. I'd keep the thing going, with the help of Jim Yankauer; I'd
                    read the news, and he'd go out and get the back-half of the 30-minute program,
                    of which we had four a day, one geared to each area of the world: Europe, Near
                    East, Latin America, Asia. I had to voice one of the programs because we
                    couldn't get a purchase order guy for all four of them. This commuting between
                    Washington and New York went on for some three months, I guess.</p>
                <p>I think English was the first to move, because of the penthouse studios we had in
                    the Interior Department building, and the ones that were being built over in the
                    HET; Building had not yet been completed. They started sending guys down, one by
                    one. Doc Harper was one of the early ones, and the guy who died, Russ Shephard.
                    He and his wife, Pat, lived in the apartment right above mine in Arlington. I
                    heard an awful thump about five or 5:30 in the afternoon, and I went rushing
                    upstairs to see what it was. Lo and behold he had just keeled over during his
                    supper time. I couldn't get him to open his eyes, and he didn't respond. I held
                    him up, in accordance with my pharmacist's mate training in the Merchant Marine.
                    Pat was there. She took it rather calmly, and called an ambulance which arrived
                    quickly and took him to Arlington Hospital. The guys on the ambulance were
                    shaking their heads.</p>
                <p>Hogan Takes Over English Service in Washington</p>
                <p>I ran the English operation in Washington for maybe six months, and then they
                    brought in Bill Rainey, an ex-NBC producer and NAM functionary. I remember
                    preparing him a loose-leaf notebook on how the English service operated and the
                    personalities working in it. Anyone reading that would have a pretty damn good
                    idea of what Worldwide English was about, and who the people were who produced
                    most of it.</p>
                <p>Then Moves Temporarily to Head Latin American Service</p>
                <p>After English, I temporarily took over the Latin American Service. They had to
                    have somebody in the Voice to deal with Walter Lemmon's Worldwide Broadcasting
                    Foundation which carried the Spanish and Portuguese programming to Latin
                    America. He wasn't all that easy to deal with. We started our own Latin American
                    Service, to send tapes to radio stations in Latin America. I did enjoy that
                    period. I remember Virgil Fulling was on the staff. Later he committed suicide
                    he was one of the informers during the McCarthy hearings. I didn't get too close
                    to him, but I think Virgil was totally sincere. He wasn't out for anybody's
                    hide, because he didn't like Barry Zorthian or what have you. I think he was a
                    bit foolish to do what he did.</p>
                <p>Hogan Moves on to Special Events - 1954</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>It must have been 1954 that I took over Special Events, because I remember that
                    as chief, I'd get a crack at some of those overseas trips, so I always managed
                    to save one good one for myself every three or four months, as I was interested
                    in learning more about foreign countries. I had attempted several times to get
                    overseas, and every time something would stand in the way.</p>
                <p>Special Events were defined as any program origination that took place outside
                    the studio, such as the Courier (a Coast Guard ship refurbished and fitted out
                    as a floating transmitter) commissioned and turned over to the Voice of America,
                    either live or recorded — as opposed to a reporter going out to cover a
                    story.</p>
                <p>The Cairo Packaging Center—Later the Cairo Programming Center</p>
                <p>I left Special events in May of 1956 to go overseas to head what had the ungainly
                    title of the Cairo Packaging Center. I asked them to change the name since
                    everybody thought I was going over there to run a liquor store in a Muslim
                    country. They changed it to Cairo Programming Center. Burtt McKee was probably
                    the first director, because he was sent over to Cairo as radio officer for USIS
                    Cairo. I know he was there before the coup d'etat when Nasser came to power. It
                    was the Center's job to put together everything except the news that was
                    broadcast in Arabic, six hours of programming a day. The news came by shortwave
                    from Washington to Rhodes, where the Courier was on station. (I covered the
                    dedication of the Courier down at the Potomac River with Harry Truman present.
                    Some Congressman inserted the transcript of the broadcast in the Congressional
                    Record.) We air-mailed the tapes, and had to stay three weeks ahead of the
                    calendar. These were obviously not timely things, of course. The news lasted 15
                    minutes at the top of the hour, and we did the other 45 minutes for four hours
                    in the evening and two hours in the morning. We had a staff of some six or seven
                    and some purchase order people we hired locally from Cairo Radio.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>And we had a sub-post in Beirut, providing some material. Aly Kayaalp was out
                    there in the sub-post when I got to Cairo, and later Gus Zavalas. Jim Barker was
                    the division chief for the Near East, and sometimes Jim could be rather
                    peremptory in his decisions, particularly involving people. When Aly Kayaalp was
                    due to be transferred to Saigon, before the Vietnam war heated up as far as the
                    U.S. was concerned, Barker told me, “I'm sending you Gus Zavalas”. Gus was a
                    very 'busy' person. You might not know what he was doing, but he was busy making
                    deals, not illegally or anything like that, but I don't think I ever went to
                    Beirut unexpectedly and found Gus at the office. I 'd usually track him down in
                    no time at all. We had five or six people working in Beirut, and same of them
                    are still working for the Arabic Branch of the Voice of America today. Kamel
                    Taweel was a difficult person to work with. He always had a beef, or complaint
                    about something, but you could never get at what is was. You'd sit down and talk
                    to him for an hour — I remember he came to see me at my home one afternoon, and
                    we sat for an hour talking about the problems in the office. We went around and
                    around, and I never knew what he was getting at. I remember Jean (Hogan's wife)
                    saying when he left, “What was that all about?” She had sat where she could hear
                    it. I didn't know myself, frankly. Kamel was unnerved about what some of the
                    other people were saying about him. As I learned more about the Arabs, I learned
                    that this is not unusual; they tend to suspect one another.</p>

                <p>I was in Cairo from May of 1956 to October of 1960, when I went to Dar es Salaam
                    as PAO. Two years later, I went to Nairobi. I saw independence come in both
                    countries. I was a year before independence in Dar es Salaam and a year after,
                    and the same thing in Nairobi. Which experience, of course, did me a great deal
                    of good as far as Africa was concerned.</p>
                <p>Back to Washington (1965): VOA African Division Chief. Then PAO Libya</p>
                <p>From Nairobi I returned to Washington to become chief of the VOA Africa Division.
                    I stayed there as Division Chief only a little over a year and a half or nearly
                    two years; I wanted to get out again, and when an opening occurred in Tripoli, I
                    got it. That was March of 1967. Blake Cochran at that time was running the
                    Rhodes Program Center — or was it Liberia, where he was working on programs?
                    Henry Loomis had some sort of big idea about a program center in Liberia as a
                    great training station where Africans could come to study broadcasting. It was
                    an interesting period</p>
                <p>Assignment to Vietnam: 1970</p>
                <p>From Tripoli, I went to Vietnam, where I spent five years —PsyOps adviser for the
                    first region for three years, and then press attach� for the ambassador for two
                    years,, with the rank of Minister-Counselor, believe it or not. {Editor's note:
                    Hogan was in Vietnam when South Vietnam fell to the Communists. In a second
                    interview, which follows this one, he deals at more length with his experiences
                    in Vietnam, particularly the frantic evacuation in April of 1975}</p>

                <p>After I got back to Washington, when Vietnam fell in April of 1975, those of us
                    who had served in Vietnam had a tough time getting an assignment. I couldn't get
                    anywhere. I went down to see Ken Giddens (VOA Director), and said, “Look, I
                    can't find anybody who's interested in the least in hiring me, in the Voice or
                    anywhere else in the Agency. I'd like to see if you've got anything going around
                    here that I could help with.” “Well”, he said, “I think maybe we have. How would
                    you like to go to Rhodes? We've got to close that place down in a year and a
                    half.” In a year and a half I'd be 60, and have to retire under the law of the
                    time. So, I closed the place down, with Kamel Taweel</p>
                <p>Intervention here by Russ Black. Who Tells of a Nixon Visit to Africa in Which
                    Hogan was Involved</p>
                <p>BLACK: When Nixon returned from an African trip on which Eisenhower had sent him
                    in '57, he reported that the continent needed a broadcast service. John Hogan
                    was sent from Cairo to accompany him on that trip as the VOA correspondent. They
                    put out a memorandum saying: You are now the African Service. I was the editor
                    of a transcription service for Africa at the time, which was a small part of the
                    Near East Operation from the Courier at Rhodes — so we changed our name and
                    started broadcasting. It was about then that Jack Logan joined us, and Tom
                    Snyder was there. For two years we were broadcasting into blank space. We didn't
                    have a listener in Africa. Jack Logan was in the reserve in the Navy, or
                    something, and he got on a Navy cruiser that went all around Africa. They
                    couldn't pick up a signal even with that high powered Navy equipment. They sent
                    a second trip all around Africa, and they came back and said not one place could
                    it be picked up. So for two years we broadcast into thin air. At the same time,
                    Henry Loomis was traveling through Africa, and I got a copy of one of his
                    speeches in which he described being told by a man in a loin cloth that he
                    listened to the Voice of America every night.</p>
                <p>John Hogan Now Resumes Narration. and Speaks Agaiof Earlier Dar es Salaam and
                    Nairobi Events</p>
                <p>HOGAN: When I was in Dar es Salaam, that Liberia transmitter was booming in there
                    like a ton of bricks. We had a lot of well educated people in Kenya when I was
                    there. The British did a terrific job. I don't doubt that our audiences in
                    Africa was not good in the early days. Walter Lemmon, with his station in
                    Boston, instead of just beaming to Latin America, was shifting over to reach the
                    Portuguese speaking countries of Angola and Mozambique. He carried some VOA
                    programs on contract, I think and whether or what effect they had I don't know.
                    After the Nixon trip to Africa, it was decided that they would name an Assistant
                    Secretary of State for African Affairs. Palmer was his name. I was able to join
                    the Nixon party in time to cover the independence celebrations in Ghana. Jack
                    Logan was also out there at the time, just for the Ghana portion of the trip, as
                    I recall.</p>

                <p>Off Again. On Again Retirement: 1977</p>
                <p>I was due to retire in July of 1977, which was about when Rhodes was slated to
                    close down. We transferred programs back to Washington piece meal, with 50% of
                    the staff sent back to Washington, and then later, the rest of them. In June I
                    got a wire saying, “We lost the case (to change the retirement age in the
                    Foreign Service) but we can delay your retirement” — I forget how long — so I
                    decided to stay a while longer. I came back and sat on my duff and didn't do a
                    heck of a lot, but helped the Arabic Service out with all kinds of chores. When
                    the court decision was reversed by the Supreme Court, saying both State and USIA
                    had a right to set retirement age, I went ahead and retired.</p>
                <p>Random Reminiscences of Persons and Events in a Long Career</p>
                <p>Through my years in the Foreign Service, my experience with VOA included visits
                    from correspondents, whom I provided with facilities and help. Even when I was
                    still in Cairo they sent an English correspondent out to report from the CPC.
                    I'm not sure I like the new arrangement for the VOA correspondents, which came
                    into effect while I was in Vietnam. I used to brief correspondents all the time,
                    of course, and I paid special attention to VOA, partly because it was
                    broadcasting back to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I never could figure out why the press, the commercial press, operated the way it
                    did in Vietnam. They were like lemmings, following whatever the New York Times
                    man was writing. If he was against something, everybody else would slant their
                    stories the same way. AP for a while had some very important journalists running
                    their bureau in Saigon, but it whittled itself down to a reporter named George
                    Esper. I used to say that George had in his lower right hand drawer a number of
                    stories with blanks in them which he would just fill in before filing. The AP
                    was not nearly as responsible as the UPI, and it's quite often the other way
                    around. I don't think Esper had much training, although he wrote a book about
                    Vietnam, which I haven't bothered to read. He always overdid the importance of
                    everything he was reporting on. He started with the AP as what they call a
                    gofer, fetching this and that. Little by little, George rose and finally wound
                    up as bureau chief. UPI had some real heavyweights.</p>
                <p>In recalling Eddie Raquello; he used to call five minutes or so before closing
                    time, often on a Friday night. Just having to have something from Washington,
                    some outlandish request. The silent sound tape he wanted from inside the Lincoln
                    Memorial was just the last straw. He always went around with a little bit of wet
                    cigarette hanging down, dripping ashes. He called everybody Sweetie Pie. Some of
                    the time I was able to talk him out of his wilder requests.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I still have recordings of the entire series of McCarthy hearings regarding the
                    Voice, the old 15-inch acetate discs we used to put programs on. I 've kept them
                    because I thought they might be of some use some day. There was another set of
                    recordings in New York, which disappeared. I have no idea what happened to them.
                    I tried to give mine to the Voice — they're really the Voice's property — but
                    nobody wanted them. If today's leadership wants them, they're welcome to them,
                    but I can't afford the cost of shipping them from Hawaii.</p>
                <p>{Another Intervention by Russ Black. Having — Confusedly —to Do With the Factions
                    Within the Voice When He Came Rack from RFE}</p>
                <p>BLACK: There was the Vienna combine, I think they called it, and there was Jerry
                    Dooher's group. In the Vienna combine, you had Walter Roberts and John Albert
                    and Bob Bauer. Jim Barker took dead aim at me, and kept giving me bad
                    assignments. I went down there and said to him, “You apparently have something
                    against me. Why don't you just punish me, punish me real bad, and let's get it
                    over with and maybe I can go ahead and do my work.” “Why, I have every
                    confidence in you”, he said. “I've done everything I could to further your
                    career.” So, I'd go back, and in two or three months he'd lower the boom again.
                    Hogan agrees he was a difficult man to work for, though he says he got along
                    with him all right.</p>
                <p>Hogan Reminiscences Continued</p>
                <p>HOGAN: Gene King appeared to do things on the spur of the moment. I first bumped
                    into him in Paris, when he was with the ECA radio operation. I went there to
                    cover the sixth UN General Assembly, and I was told by someone in New York,
                    maybe A1 Puhan, to go see Gene King to get the use of a tape recorder. We didn't
                    have these nice little portable ones in those days. When I went to Gene King, he
                    says, “Well, I may not have a long white beard, but I 'm sure your mistaking me
                    for Santa Claus. I don't have a machine to let you have.” Another guy, who'd
                    been working with us in Paris since the war, fixed me up with a recording
                    machine. Gene was a difficult person, they say. I had no trouble with him. He
                    gave me that job in Cairo — that is, when it became vacant he decided I should
                    go over and take it. He knew I'd been trying to get overseas and had had no luck
                    so far. When I had a chance to go as PAO in San Salvador, he asked me to stay
                    and keep running the Latin American Service, dealing with Walter Lemmon, and he
                    would see that I got the first good job overseas that came up. And the first one
                    that came up, in the spring of '56, was the chief of the Cairo Packaging
                    Center.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>John Wiggin left his mark on the Voice probably as much as any guy I can think
                    of, not only for Music USA, but for starting the program reviews. Doc Harper
                    also qualifies as a “character”. He was one of the sweetest men I ever knew. He
                    was one of the ones sent down before the Voice moved to Washington. We were
                    doing English programs from the penthouse of the Interior Building as one of the
                    first stages in the move to Washington, and Doc was among the pioneers to get
                    the place going. He was so faithful to come in. I'd need a guy to voice a show
                    at 8 o'clock at night because somebody hadn't shown up and he'd come in. He'd
                    say, “I live not too far away, and I don't mind.” He was a topkick in the
                    Infantry in World War I, and had worked on a farm in Illinois. I don't know
                    whether or not he had had any medical training which led to his nickname, Doc.
                    He was a good one to use if we had something to do with John Foster Dulles.
                    Dulles liked him very much. L. Baldwin Harper. He used that name to Dulles.</p>

                <p>[EDITORIAL NOTE: Mr. Hogan was terminally ill when this interview took place.
                    This placed a limitation on the interviewer's ability to probe more deeply into
                    Mr. Hogan's evaluation of USIS accomplishments during his service in each
                    country. Furthermore, Mr. Hogan had been interviewed several months earlier on
                    September 21, 1987. Although that interview concentrated more on his VOA work,
                    there is of necessity some overlap of information with the current one.</p>
                <p>Mr. Hogan died a few weeks after this interview was conducted. It was never
                    possible to clarify his remarks further. G. Lewis Schmidt edited the transcript

                <p>HOGAN: Oh, well, I came originally from Portland, Maine, born in Lewiston, and
                    was brought up in Maine, went to school there. I went to college, actually, down
                    in Georgia, Mercy University. That is not how I got into the Information
                    Service, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, let us take it up to World War II; is then when
                        you first became acquainted with the antecedents of USIA, or were you in the
                        Army?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: I was in the U.S. Merchant Marine. I think the total years in that
                    organization were three, after which when the peace was signed with Japan, I
                    left. You did not have to wait to be disowned by your service and discharged;
                    you could go any time you wanted to and that was one of the reasons I joined the
                    organization in the first place.</p>
                <p>At the end of World War II I did go back into the radio business, broadcasting
                    business in Portland, Maine, my hometown, although I had never worked in that
                    town before, I stayed there for about two and one half or three years.</p>
                <p>VOA Washington Program Center</p>
                <p>Then, in 1949, I came to Washington and took a job as Voice of America
                    Correspondent for the Washington, DC area. We had a studio there in the old
                    Interior Department Building and we had about eight or ten people on the
                    staff.</p>
                <p>I remember doing a newscast in English every afternoon, beamed, they said,
                    primarily at the intelligentsia of the Soviet Union. I used to put that little
                    newscast together every afternoon, voice it, and that was the end of my work for
                    the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when VOA was still headquartered in New York so
                        what you had in Washington at that time was sort of a branch post for Voice
                        of America before you got into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: That is right. It was a branch post. We called it the Washington Program
                    Center, and the Washington Program Center was headed by Mort Glatzer, I do not
                    know if you remember him, and Sidney Sulkin. They were the two in there.</p>
                <p>Then I came in and worked on the recordings and the newscasts and that sort of
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: The State Department. That was in 1949, I think, May, 1949. It was very
                    interesting for me, because I had never had any connection with international
                    broadcasting prior to my association with VOA. I must say I enjoyed it very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you finally get an assignment overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>First Overseas Assignment: Cairo Program Center</p>
                <p>HOGAN: My first assignment overseas was in, again, May of 1956. I went over as
                    director of the Cairo Programming Center which they called then the Cairo
                    packaging center, because it packaged programs for shipment to Arab countries
                    throughout the Middle East. I asked that the name be changed from packaging to
                    Program center because too many people thought I was there to sell liquor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, all of us, I think, remember our first
                        assignment overseas, probably looking back on it even more than some of the
                        later ones.Tell me, how did you feel when you went to Cairo and your
                        impressions working out of Egypt at that time: because this is the time
                        things were beginning to really heat up in that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Suez War — 1956</p>
                <p>HOGAN: Well, the lid blew off not long after I got there, actually, I arrived in
                    May of 1956 and in October there occurred the Tripartite War: the effort on the
                    part of France, England, and Israel to gain control of the Suez Canal or at
                    least get it out of the hands of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was the boss of Egypt
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>That blew up and I was right there to see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, at that particular time, besides doing the
                        packaging program work, did you get involved with a lot of diplomatic things
                        that were going on during that period.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: To a certain extent, yes. Not as much as if I had been a member on the
                    diplomatic list or anything like that, because at that time, while we were
                    still, I believe—well no, in 1956, we were an independent agency—by then, we
                    were an independent agency, anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>We were not privy to all of the activities of State, but I got around to some
                    extent, made a lot of friends there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go from there to Kenya, or was that later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assignment as PAO in Tanganyika</p>
                <p>HOGAN: That was later on, but I went first to Washington and then did not stay
                    there very long. I got another assignment; that was PAO in Dar es Salaam,
                    Tanganyika. It became later Tanzania as you know.</p>
                <p>PAO Kenya</p>
                <p>After a two-an-a-half year tour there, I was transferred to Kenya as the PAO in
                    that country. That country was a year away from independence, so I had the
                    unique experience of serving in Tanzania or Tanganyika, as it was called then, a
                    year before independence, and a year after; and the same in Kenya, a year before
                    independence and a year after.</p>
                <p>So, all told, I spent almost five years in East Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of Africa at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Well, those were exciting days, you know. We watched this country become
                    independent and the people who ran it, who were supposedly non-corruptible,
                    little by little go down the slippery slope. Tanganyika never has fulfilled all
                    of the hopes that we, in the Western World, thought it would achieve after
                    independence because of, I believe, President Nyerere's African socialism, as he
                    called it.</p>
                <p>He was very fond of the idea of socialism and he would — you could talk to him
                    and, incidentally, that was one of the more interesting thoughts of serving in
                    East Africa, you could talk very frequently face-to-face with the leader of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>It was not at all like Egypt, where, of course, if you saw Gamal Abdel Nasser in
                    some military parade, that was as close as you got to him. The only people who
                    ever saw him at the Embassy were the ambassador and maybe the deputy chief of
                    mission or something like that.</p>
                <p>But we had access to the cabinet ministers in Tanzania—well, Tanganyika—as it was
                    called. Incidentally, it did not become Tanzania until it merged with Zanzibar
                    and that is where the name came from, Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you followed, of course, you were there at the time
                        when the British were moving out because they were certainly influential in
                        both of those countries. Was there still a lot of British influence in Kenya
                        and Tanzania during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Oh, there was, indeed, a lot of British influence. However, there was more
                    in Kenya than there was in Tanzania. In Tanzania, the British had had that as a
                    colony only since the end of World War I, whereas in Kenya they had settled that
                    as early as 1902, and so on. I think that is when they started building a
                    railway from Mombasa up to Kenya and then further on to Uganda.</p>
                <p>However, they encouraged settlers to come to Kenya, which they never did in
                    Tanzania or Tanganyika. Tanganyika was not a colony by any means. It was a trust
                    territory of the United Nations. So, they really did not have quite the free
                    hand there that they had in Kenya.</p>
                <p>Libya and the Qadhafi Coup</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from Africa, John?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: From Africa I went to — let us see now. I went back briefly for about a
                    year and a half to run the African Division of the VOA. Then I was transferred
                    to Tripoli, Libya; capital of Libya, as the Public Affairs Officer, where I
                    stayed for a regular — a full tour. And it was a complete change</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was before our friend, Mr. Qadhafi, was it not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Yes, well, his statement of his conditions for government, as it were,
                    occurred during my stay there. Well, actually, during the very last days of my
                    stay. I was due to be transferred and be sent to Vietnam. I had already been
                    assigned a post in Vietnam and I was due to come back to Washington and take
                    training. Before I could get out of town, this bloodless coup—it was fairly
                    bloodless, I understand a few people were killed, but we never did learn exactly
                    how many—occurred.</p>
                <p>In Libya, of course, during the days the old King, Idriss, the security was
                    directly in the hands of the Libyan police, not the Army. That is how the coup
                    was finally pulled off: units of the Army were being transferred from one end of
                    the country to the other and as they passed through Tripoli, they managed to get
                    their ducks in a row and conduct a coup.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>We heard about it the next morning, but I was due to be transferred anyway, very
                    shortly. I couldn't get out for about thirteen days because the new government
                    closed the airport, but when the airport finally opened, I got out and was sent
                    back to Washington.</p>
                <p>Vietnam</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went from one quiet place to another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Yes, Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: A lot of pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Vietnam, John?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: I was in Vietnam a total of five years. I served —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in the jurisdiction of “I” Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Yes, at Da Nang. There were CORDS and PsyOps representatives for the
                    provinces up in “I” Corps Area, and for just about three years I held that job.
                    Then I was transferred down to Saigon to take over the post as press spokesman
                    for the embassy. That assignment was under Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, and
                    later on, Ambassador Graham Martin.</p>
                <p>So, I stayed there a total of two years in Saigon, and three years in Da
                    Nang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in Saigon at the end, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Yes, that is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are your impressions of that—those last days in
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Well, I will tell you they happened a little bit faster than we thought
                    they would, frankly, but we were pretty well prepared for it. All day that last
                    day which was the 30th, I believe, of April, we had to start evacuating a lot of
                    the Vietnamese who came to the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>We started the evacuation much earlier, really, of Vietnamese who had worked
                    closely with us in Vietnam about April 4th, if not before then, and we were
                    getting them out little by little.</p>
                <p>I know I was responsible for the evacuation of all of the local employees of
                    American news media working in Saigon, and their families. I managed to get out
                    598 of them before the whistle blew, and before they were caught. They would
                    have been prime targets, I am sure, at the very least harassment by the
                    Vietnamese communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you think of it now, 1975 seems like a long time ago,
                        13 years ago, but I am sure for all of you who were there in those days, in
                        many ways, it still seers like yesterday, does it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That was the very busiest day in my life, that last day
                    in the embassy compound. Looking back at it, I was so busy that now I cannot
                    remember what I did. But I remember being on the phone a great deal, trying to
                    round up more people to get them into the embassy compound and thereby get them
                    out of the country.</p>
                <p>We succeeded in doing that. In balance, I think, very well. Indeed, however, some
                    were left behind. There is no question about that, and we were certainly sorry
                    about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back at all the years you served in different
                        areas, Africa, North Africa and Asia, and the last five years in Vietnam,
                        what stands out in your mind now?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Well, I suppose — well, someone asked me not long ago what my best post
                    was; which post have you enjoyed most? I said, indeed, that is hard to say, but
                    I can tell you which one I enjoyed the least; that is no problem.</p>
                <p>That was Libya, because there was that undercurrent of discontent under the king
                    and the life in Tripoli was not as pleasant as it was in Cairo or East Africa,
                    or even in Washington. It is a country, you know, that is 95% sand, and every
                    year they would have those violent sand storms in which sand would come
                    filtering in underneath your doorstep</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They have a name for those, don't they?. Those
                        storms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOGAN: Yes, they have. I am trying to think what it is. I cannot — they are not
                    monsoons, but they are “gibleys”. Gibleys, that is what they are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You cannot see your hand in front of your face, can
                        you; when you get one of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HOGAN: No, that is right. They had that to some extent in Cairo, too, but it was
                    much more pronounced in Libya. I did not enjoy Libya nearly as much as I enjoyed
                    Cairo and the East African posts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, thanks very much for this interview. I hope this
