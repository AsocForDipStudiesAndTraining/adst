                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 28, 1991. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Wells Stabler on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies. Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you would give me something about your
                        background—where you came from, your education, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, I was born in Boston. My father at that time was in the State
                    Department, the Foreign Service, although he went back and forth a bit from
                    Foreign Service to business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strictly speaking there wasn't a Foreign Service in 1919.
                        You were born in 1919.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, October 31, 1919. There was not. strictly speaking, a Foreign
                    Service although there was at that time a Diplomatic Service. He was a member of
                    the Diplomatic Service. Just before I was born he was a member of the US
                    Delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, advising on Latin American affairs. At
                    the time of my birth he had shifted over briefly to private business and was a
                    Vice President of All American Cables in Buenos Aires. In early 1920 he came
                    back to the State Department, but only for a few years. In about 1924 he again
                    returned to private business and was in Ecuador representing a consortium of
                    American banks in their effort to collect a loan that the Ecuadoran Government
                    owed to those banks. I was about five years old then, and my brother, who was
                    two years older, and I, appropriately accompanied, went by boat to join my
                    parents in Quito. In about a year's time, after the successful completion of his
                    work in Ecuador, my father was named as Secretary General of the Tacna-Arica
                    Plebiscite which involved a long-standing dispute between Chile and Peru over
                    the sovereignty of those two provinces. In 1925 President Coolidge appointed
                    General John J. Pershing, who had led the American Expeditionary Force in World
                    War I, to supervise the Plebiscite. Pershing's headquarters were in Iquique,
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>As Iquique was not considered a fit place for women and children, my mother, my
                    brother and I lived further south in Vi�a del Mar near Valparaiso. We were there
                    for nine months, and for a part of that time I attended an English school, St.
                    Paul's. In 1926, when the Plebiscite was called off because of rioting in the
                    two provinces, we returned to Washington. My father became the Chief of the
                    Latin American Division of the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were how old at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER:Oh, I was about six or seven. In 1927 he finally retired from the
                    Diplomatic Service and took a job with Gulf Oil Company. We all moved down to
                    Caracas, Venezuela where he became head of governmental relations for Gulf Oil
                    in Venezuela. We lived there for almost nine years. However, during those years
                    my brother and I came up to boarding school in the US - Fay School in
                    Southborough, Mass., followed by Brooks School in North Andover, Mass., and then
                    graduation cum laude from Harvard in 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Am I correct in assuming that you learned Spanish during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, we spoke Spanish As we were living in a Spanish-speaking country.
                    But my last summer in Venezuela was in 1936, because in 1937 after I graduated
                    from school, I went over to Europe and spent the summer in Belgium with a
                    Belgian family learning to speak French. So I really did not speak Spanish again
                    except in Paris when we were there later on - we had Spanish household help. But
                    I did not really have to speak Spanish until I was appointed as Ambassador to
                    Madrid in 1975.</p>
                <p>To go back, in September or October 1941, several months after graduating from
                    Harvard I came down to Washington to see if I could get a job in the State
                    Department. I had always wanted to go into the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you had had tremendous exposure to this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: We had had a lot of exposure to diplomatic life and to living abroad. Of
                    course, when my father was in Venezuela he was no longer with the Government,
                    but he was involved at that time with the Venezuelan Government. So there was a
                    background of political science, if you will.</p>
                <p>As I said, I came down to Washington to look for a job in the State department.
                    At that time, because of the war in Europe, they had stopped giving the regular
                    Foreign Service exams and I was not at that point entirely sure how I was going
                    to deal with this. But through my father's friendship of long standing with the
                    then Under Secretary of State, Sumner Welles, I went to see Mr. Welles and he
                    very kindly put me in touch with the Personnel people in the State Department. I
                    went to see Jack Earhardt who was at that point Chief of Foreign Service
                    Personnel. He referred me to Robert Macatee, who was an Assistant Chief of
                    Foreign Service Personnel. [It is amusing that that was 1941, and seven years
                    later in 1948, Mr. Macatee was my Consul General in Jerusalem].</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I was offered an appointment in the Foreign Service Auxiliary in the fall of 1941
                    with assignment as Vice Consul in Bogot�. I started work in the Department in
                    the first days of November of 1941 in the office in the Division of American
                    Republic Affairs which acted as the liaison with the Office of the Coordinator
                    of Inter-American Affairs headed by Nelson Rockefeller. John Dreier was the head
                    of the office I worked in and we coordinated for the State Department the
                    activities of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in its contacts with the
                    coordinating committees in the various countries of Latin America.</p>
                <p>After a short while I decided that I really would like to stay on in Washington
                    in the work I was doing. So my assignment to Bogot� was cancelled. I remained in
                    the Department in this position from 1941 until 1943 at which point I was
                    appointed as Desk Officer for Ecuadoran Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about this time you were working under Nelson
                        Rockefeller?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, we worked in the Division of the then ARA (American Republic
                    Affairs). Philip Bonsal was my first chief in that office. Then over him was
                    Larry Duggan who had the title of Political Adviser for ARA. In those days there
                    were only three or four Assistant Secretaries and that was all. So, we worked in
                    the Division of ARA under Phil Bonsal but also closely with Larry Duggan.
                    Ultimately the Political Advisers became Assistant Secretaries in charge of
                    various Office Directors (no longer called Chiefs.)</p>
                <p>Our job was to make sure that the type of thing that Nelson Rockefeller's office
                    did in Latin America was consistent with US Government policy as set by the
                    Secretary of State. Rockefeller set up so-called coordinating committees in many
                    of these countries, particularly as a wartime effort to try to galvanize
                    American communities to be helpful in the war effort. These were made up of
                    American businessmen and they worked closely with the Embassies, but they were
                    not governmental entities. They received support from Rockefeller's office
                    which, of course, was funded by funds appropriated by Congress. So we were in
                    close touch with Rockefeller's office and his people who were involved in this
                    particular activity.</p>
                <p>I was very young then, 22 or 23. As I look back on it, it was sort of heady stuff
                    to find letters written to these committees signed “Nelson Rockefeller” and
                    having to call up Mr. Rockefeller's people and say that I am sorry but I am not
                    sending their letter because it was inconsistent with policy. It was quite
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for this. Again from your perspective,
                        obviously you were getting it from your superiors, was there sort of a
                        feeling that Rockefeller was all very well and good but he was a little bit
                        of a loose canon at that time, or was it really just one of coordinating of
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think that, on the whole, people felt that he was really very sincere
                    in this effort and it was important to do whatever we could to keep the
                    sympathies of these Latin American countries with the United States. There were
                    a number of countries that had close ties and sympathies with the Axis powers,
                    particularly Germany. Argentina was one, Chile was another. The Nazis had been
                    very active in the years before the war in trying to establish footholds in
                    these countries. In fact, my major thesis for graduation from Harvard was about
                    the Nazi presence in Latin America. The work that had been done by the Germans
                    was quite extensive. Rockefeller's work was aimed at trying to undercut the
                    German presence by galvanizing American presence, the American businessmen in
                    these communities, to help in that effort. But naturally when you have a
                    situation where you have an embassy and an official US presence and you have
                    this unofficial presence—you have the Department of State on one side and a
                    complementary group which looked at itself at times as another Department of
                    State dealing with Latin affairs, you obviously open the door to some confusion
                    and some cross purposes. Rockefeller obviously had considerable political
                    standing. He was, of course, not a member of the President's party, being a
                    Republican and Roosevelt being a Democrat, but this is war time and obviously
                    that political difference was of no import.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had people such as Knox and Stimson in the cabinet. It
                        was a much more unified cabinet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Absolutely. Political differences disappeared during the war. I don't
                    really recall now all the background of how or why this Coordinator of
                    Inter-American Affairs was setup because it had been setup before I came into
                    the State Department, but on the whole it worked really quite well. The office
                    that I was in - I think there were three of us all together - had to look at a
                    great deal of correspondence that came through us from the Rockefeller office
                    going down to these coordinating committees. Also there were other programs they
                    were involved in. Cultural affairs, economic affairs, etc. So we were quite busy
                    trying to make sure that what was done didn't run counter to official
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the OWI, Office of War Information, which was
                        the predecessor to USIA? It seems it would need a coordinator job as
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Except, as I recall it now, the CIA (which the office of Coordinator of
                    Inter-American Affairs was called) was given a fairly broad mandate with respect
                    to Latin American affairs. I don't recall that the OWI really got tremendously
                    involved in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may have been sort of the same way the FBI was given
                        the mandate to do the intelligence thing in Latin America. Latin America was
                        treated separately.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think this was it. My recollection is that the Rockefeller office had
                    a very broad mandate in terms of what happened in that area, with the exception
                    of the official side handled by the Department of State, and obviously the
                    military side with their attach�s. Rockefeller really had the broad field of
                    responsibility for dealing with various aspects of Latin American affairs that
                    were not strictly political, covering a fairly broad range of cultural and
                    psychological, if you will, economic and things of that sort.</p>
                <p>Now, I said economic, but it had nothing to do with strategic materials, that was
                    handled by the Board of Economic Warfare, or whatever it was called, which had
                    the responsibility for making sure that US had access to these strategic
                    materials and making sure that whatever was exported was denied to the Axis
                    powers. The Rockefeller people did not get into that at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression you were getting from your place
                        of Nelson Rockefeller?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think that people respected him as an able person who had quite a bit
                    of background in Latin American affairs. There had been a long association of
                    the Rockefellers in one form and another in Latin American. The Rockefeller
                    Foundation, of course, had done an absolutely superb job in many parts of Latin
                    America and later on in other parts of the world in stamping out malaria and
                    things of that sort. There had been the economic interests which developed a
                    good deal after the war. I got to know him at one point quite well, junior
                    though I was, and I always found him a very pleasant person to deal with.</p>
                <p>Even though one could have expected some resentment at this junior officer
                    dealing with these things, I never found that. Later on my mother also worked in
                    that organization and knew Nelson Rockefeller. After that, I had no contact with
                    him at all until he turned up in Madrid in 1975 representing the United States
                    at the Franco funeral and at the installation of King Juan Carlos. We renewed
                    the association, although I suspect that he had no clear recollection of me
                    since it had been 30 years or so since we had met. But here again I found him
                    most pleasant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was then Vice President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: He was then Vice President. I always liked him and recall that in the
                    40's in Washington he was a respected person and one with whom it was basically
                    quite easy to get along with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This covers your Washington time. Again from your
                        perspective as a junior person, did you get any feeling particularly in
                        Latin American affairs about Sumner Welles? Was he really calling the tune
                        on Latin America policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think Sumner Welles at that time was calling the tune pretty well on
                    almost all policies. He certainly was regarded by the President as the expert on
                    foreign affairs. Cordell Hull, of course, was a respected person too and had
                    some political background, which Sumner did not. But I think Franklin Roosevelt
                    turned to Sumner Welles for expert advice on foreign affairs. He probably did
                    not feel comfortable in turning to Cordell Hull for the finer points of
                    diplomacy. So it was my impression at the time that Sumner Welles not only
                    called the tune with respect to what we did in Latin America, but also with
                    respect to some of the more difficult negotiations in Europe. Of course, you
                    recall that he made that trip to Europe not so very long before we went to war
                    to try get a feel as to what was happening, and the possibilities of the future
                    of Europe in terms of the war.</p>
                <p>Certainly within the State Department he occupied an extremely important position
                    and was regarded, I think by most of us, as the expert on foreign affairs,
                    although everybody had a lot of respect for Cordell Hull. But the general
                    feeling, as I recall it, was that people did not really think that Cordell Hull
                    had that sensitivity to foreign relations which Welles had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really in a way when there were problems the decisions
                        were made by Sumner Welles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Pretty much. I think he was fairly careful too, however, not to cut
                    Cordell Hull out. I think Cordell Hull had a political standing with the
                    President. He had been there quite some time. Welles probably was careful not to
                    burn any bridges as far as Cordell was concerned, although there may have been
                    things that the President discussed with Welles that he might not have wanted to
                    be discussed with Cordell Hull. I think those of us then serving in the
                    Department at that time would have regarded Sumner Welles as sort of the chief
                    practitioner of foreign relations.</p>
                <p>But then, of course, it was not so very long after that, that all came to a
                    rather tragic halt, and we now know what happened. There and then he
                    disappeared. And for reasons that I have never fully understood, Edward
                    Stettinius was put in as Under Secretary of State. He had no background,
                    whatsoever, in foreign affairs which was very clear and obvious as one dealt
                    with him. Cordell Hull probably had a good deal to do with this.</p>
                <p>As I noted earlier, in 1943 I became Desk Officer for Ecuadoran Affairs. This was
                    interesting for me because the Ecuadoran Ambassador in Washington, Colon Aloy
                    Alfaro had been an old personal friend of my father. So the relationship was a
                    very easy going one and we worked very well together. Much of the work with
                    Ecuador had to do with strategic materials and we did what we could to make
                    Ecuadorans feel a part of the war effort, although they were not in the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>For example, we brought up to this country the Ecuadoran Minister of Defense,
                    General Romero and I was involved at that time in planning his visit. I
                    participated fully in it when he was here in Washington and was thrown with
                    people like General Marshall and others which obviously from my point of view
                    was very interesting. I went up to New York with him and one of the things that
                    amused me on looking back over my papers is a picture of me, General Romero, and
                    Fiorello La Guardia which appeared in a New York newspaper in late '43 or '44,
                    whenever it was.</p>
                <p>For me, as a career thing, being a desk officer was very interesting although
                    Ecuador clearly did not play an enormous role in affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a border problem with Peru?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I do not recall that at that time this was a problem. I do not remember
                    that there were any really serious problems that one dealt with at that time. It
                    was largely a hand-holding operation and one of insuring that whatever strategic
                    materials Ecuador had were made available to the United States. It seems to me
                    that one of our particular interests was obtaining bark from the cinchona tree
                    for the production of anti-malaria quinine for our troops. There were certainly
                    other strategic materials in Ecuador, but I am not sure that I can recall which
                    ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention the term “strategic materials.” It seems that
                        a great deal of effort within the Foreign Service during the war...obviously
                        the Foreign Service wasn't in a lot of countries where our enemy was...a lot
                        of effort was put in making a blacklist, keeping strategic materials from
                        the Axis, etc. But something bothers me. You have the British and later the
                        American navy together, pretty much controlling the sea except for
                        submarines. How could strategic materials get to the Axis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think the concern really was that there could be possible
                    transshipments. There seemed to be various ways of doing these things because
                    the Germans, at the outset of the war, had a fairly good command of the sea.
                    There were German and neutral ships that would come into these various ports and
                    there was concern that somehow some of these materials would leak out that way.
                    One could not always be certain that the US and British navies, which were
                    pretty well occupied in other places as well, would be able to control the long
                    coast line of Latin America.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>You mentioned the blacklist. That was important too, because there were various
                    companies that had German money and German and Italian contacts. There was not
                    what you might say a hemorrhage in terms of the export of strategic materials,
                    but there were possibilities for the Axis to have access to some of these
                    materials. It was in that context that we were particularly vigilant in trying
                    to identify firms and enterprises in these countries that had these Axis
                    connections and working with the governments to try to get their cooperation not
                    only to prevent the export, but also to enhance our possibilities of getting the
                    strategic materials we wanted.</p>
                <p>In the case of Ecuador, the political problems were not great because the
                    Ecuadorans did not have great sympathies for the Axis. So we were not in the
                    same position as we were in other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had not been the intense migration of Italians and
                        Germans to Ecuador as there were to Argentina, Chile, etc.STABLER:
                        Absolutely not. There were problems in Peru, but Ecuador did not have this
                        problem. As I said before, our effort with Ecuador was mainly a hand-holding
                        operation. To have General Romero come up here was, after all, not an
                        enormously important facet of our war program. When he came up he had to be
                        entertained—dinners were given for him. General Marshall had to go to things
                        of that sort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself when he came up there having a
                        problem getting some of the people like General Marshall's office to focus
                        on this, or were they politically sensitive enough to know that you had to
                        do this type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I always found it quite remarkable that in spite of the war going on,
                    people like General Marshall and others, various Chiefs of Staff, etc., were
                    very understanding of the political needs. There really was not very much
                    difficulty in getting them to rally around and attend the things they were
                    supposed to attend. My recollection was, for example, when I went over to the
                    Army Department in order that General Romero could confer some decorations on
                    some of our people, they participated, possibly kicking and shouting, but they
                    did it. I remember one very large dinner at the Mayflower during his visit where
                    all the top brass people turned up at least for part of the evening. It was
                    quite remarkable. But I think they all understood the need to participate in
                    this hand-holding operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved to another job dealing with...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STABLER: In late '43, I think it was, I had had this vision of my father having
                    participated in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 on the US delegation. I
                    thought it would be quite interesting to repeat that, if you will, and position
                    myself to perhaps be on the US delegation to the peace conference following
                    World War II. I knew that there had been set up in the Department a group called
                    the Committee on Post-War Programs. This was a senior committee chaired by
                    Edward Stettinius as the Under Secretary of State, to develop various political
                    and economic programs for the post-war period. So I went to see a friend of my
                    father, Breckinridge Long, who was then an Assistant Secretary of State and who
                    had also been in the Diplomatic Service and Ambassador to Italy, to get his
                    support for being taken on in that Post-War Programs Committee. specifically on
                    the political side.</p>
                <p>I then applied for the job, and with Long's support, I found myself in early '44
                    as assistant secretary for political affairs to the Post-War Programs Committee.
                    I worked directly for the secretary for political affairs to the Committee,
                    Easton Rothwell. He was an academic. Then there was the secretary for economic
                    affairs, John Fuqua, also an academic. I found this very interesting, although I
                    have frankly to admit that here I was just barely two years out of college and I
                    was really out of my depth. I really did not have the background that a lot of
                    the people on the Committee had to deal with this thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself sitting there at night pondering
                        whither Europe...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, because I really did not participate so much on the substantive
                    side. I took notes and prepared minutes and that sort of gofer type of work. The
                    heady work was actually done by the various agencies and departments. The
                    secretariat performed a secretariat function although, I guess, my boss did
                    prepare papers and I may have prepared a few papers here and there. But it was
                    not something which I frankly admit I was really prepared for. So after almost
                    six months in that job, I recognized, and Easton Rothwell recognized, that the
                    job should be taken by somebody who was older and more experienced in this type
                    of work. I decided that I would leave it and go back into the proper Foreign
                    Service. So in the late summer of '44 I went to Personnel and requested transfer
                    back into the Foreign Service side, although again the Foreign Service exams
                    were not being given. So I went back into the Foreign Service Auxiliary. I
                    continued working the Post-War Programs office for a while waiting for an
                    assignment. In the fall of '44 I left the job permanently and was shortly
                    thereafter appointed vice consul in Jerusalem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back to this Post-War Programs
                        Committee to get a feel of the times, because what you are telling me is
                        that here you are a young man who realizes he is over his head. Looking at
                        things today, we are speaking with the hindsight of two veteran Foreign
                        Service Officers. It is not unusual to have young men or women charging
                        around in their twenties who really don't know what they are doing, but have
                        power often, while acting for somebody, and are full of confidence dealing
                        with things they really don't know enough about. Is there a little
                        difference of attitude there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: The question really here was that the senior people in the secretariat
                    were all academics. There was, I think, a certain greater division in those days
                    in many ways between those who were sort of career people and the outside
                    academic who was brought in for a specific function. There was not very much
                    power in these jobs. An assistant secretary for political affairs really had no
                    power as such because he worked for the secretary for political affairs who was
                    an academic. He was not encouraged to take any particular initiative on anything
                    because the substantive work was done in the various agencies and departments
                    and by specific offices set up for this purpose. The meetings were rather
                    sharply divided between the political discussions and the economic discussions.
                    When they were talking about strictly economic matters, the secretary for
                    economic affairs attended the meetings. I found it rather strange in a way that
                    there was not cross-fertilization there. I remember that one day I did go just
                    to sit in on the economic meetings and was sharply chastised for having done so
                    by the people in the Secretariat. It had apparently disturbed and annoyed Mr.
                    Stettinius so ultimately I had to apologize for sitting in on the meeting. But
                    they very much compartmentalized it and the idea was that if you were political
                    you did not need to know what was happening on the economic side.</p>
                <p>There was this sort of funny situation that developed there. I also have to
                    confess that, as I sat in some of these discussions on the political side with
                    some of the very senior people in government, in taking notes I just did not
                    have the background sometimes to understand fully what they were talking
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The allusions sometimes just...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: They went by me. I had had no hands-on experience in European affairs. I
                    had been entirely in Latin American Affairs up to the time I went to this
                    Committee. So the allusions that were made, even to certain historical things,
                    were often just not in my ken and I felt uncomfortable in the job. Clearly, I
                    think, it showed. So that was why I say I ultimately recognized, and my
                    colleague Mr. Rothwell recognized, that I probably would do better
                    elsewhere.</p>

                <p>STABLER: Yes, he chaired these meetings. I sat in on many of these political
                    meetings to take notes. My impression was that he chaired them but did not
                    really engage in very much of the substantive discussion because he did not know
                    much about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read somewhere where he had a tendency at a meeting to
                        sit down and say, “all right, let's take a vote on this.” Was this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, nothing of that sort, because these were serious discussions of how
                    the United States should deal with some of these questions in Europe in
                    particular. There may well have been discussions on the Far East but I don't
                    have a very clear recollection because I was only there for a few months and the
                    notes that I kept and then wrote up were all very carefully controlled. I do not
                    have a very strong memory with respect to that period. But my recollection is
                    that there was no such thing as voting because these were serious discussions,
                    consensus was built around certain positions and this, of course, was '44 so
                    there was still some time before the war ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could kind of look at this, you might say
                        almost through bifocals. First the close in as a young man listening to
                        these discussions and granted you didn't have the background and then
                        afterwards as an experienced diplomat looking back on this period. Did these
                        things tend to be sort of an academic wonderland or were these pretty good
                        discussions of how things came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: My recollection is that these were very serious, well prepared
                    discussions by senior officials of the government who faced daily decisions of
                    great magnitude. This was not just a debating society but one where efforts were
                    being seriously made to thrash out various positions, position papers, policies,
                    that the United States should follow with respect to dealing with Axis Germany,
                    Italy and Japan on a post-war basis. Again, I cannot really recall — for
                    example, I do not have any recollection that the Committee discussed, although
                    it might have, the question of what to do with the Emperor of Japan. It may have
                    been discussed later. But what to do with Germany in terms of rebuilding or the
                    treatment of post-war Germany in detail were things that were discussed.</p>
                <p>So this was a serious group and one that was designed to pull together the
                    resources of the government, not just the State Department, in contemplating
                    what should be done. Again, I suppose because of my inexperience at that time
                    and because it played a very small part in my career, I don't have at all a
                    clear recollection of exactly what we did. I cannot tell you, even anecdotally,
                    what at this particular time we discussed with regard to what should be done
                    with Hitler.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you have given a picture of its serious intent. It was
                        not a sort of academic exercise.STABLER: Not at all. It always surprised me
                        that in this very serious endeavor the person who should be chosen to chair
                        it was someone who had virtually no foreign affairs experience. He had been
                        the head of US Steel, I believe.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. This was not somebody whose entire life had been spent dealing with
                    foreign affairs. I think that was a certain weakness which was made up by the
                    experts who sat in on the meetings. There were experts from the senior level,
                    there is no question about that. So it was a serious affair and the committee
                    did go on to perform fairly important work in terms of preparing the various
                    positions that would be recommended to the President and others in the post-war
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Purely from an institutional side this was the beginning
                        of the State Department getting ready to fulfill its real role which was the
                        field of diplomacy dealing with things after the military had left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Exactly. We were all in the Old State Department Navy Building—now
                    called the Executive Office Building. In any event I left them in the fall, and
                    much to my surprise was assigned as Vice Consul in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, I was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Jerusalem in late 1944. How did you get
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>STABLER: That is a long, long story. I was visiting the family of a close friend
                    of mine, who is actually my brother-in-law, who had gone overseas with OSS. I
                    had gone up to Cooperstown to visit his family and while I was there I
                    telephoned Personnel and was told that I was going to be Vice Consul in
                    Jerusalem. Obviously, one knew about Palestine and Jerusalem, but I really had
                    to go look up a map because I hadn't had it in mind at all, except in the
                    Biblical sense. Curiously, when we lived in Venezuela, I was down there one
                    summer, and I met at the British Legation (my father and mother were great
                    friends of the British Minister and his wife) Field Marshal Lord Allenby who had
                    liberated Jerusalem from the Turks in the First World War and was visiting
                    Caracas. A very nice man. Little did I think at that time that one day I would
                    be walking the streets of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>I left Philadelphia in early November, 1944. on a Portuguese freighter. We spent
                    two weeks crossing the Atlantic, flying the Portuguese flag with a big spotlight
                    over it at night hoping that the German U-boats would see the flag of neutral
                    Portugal and leave us alone. We crossed without incident stopping briefly at the
                    Azores, but we were not allowed ashore. We finally got into Lisbon two weeks
                    after leaving.</p>
                <p>At that particular time, in order to go on...there was a flight once a week, I
                    think, from Lisbon to Gibraltar. I could have gone on that plane the day after I
                    arrived, but the Charg� d'Affaires in Lisbon was an old friend of mine from the
                    days I worked in American Republic Affairs, Newby Walmsley [his wife Teresa and
                    he are now both long dead] and he wanted me to stay for a visit. So I accepted
                    their kind invitation and stayed for a week in Lisbon by which time there were
                    no more planes for Gibraltar. So I had to go by Portuguese Airline via Tangier
                    to Casablanca. From there I was supposed to go on to Cairo.</p>
                <p>When I got to Casablanca I stayed at the famous Anfa Hotel where the January 1943
                    Casablanca Conference of Roosevelt, Churchill, de Gaulle and Giraud taken place.
                    It was under US military control. They informed me that there was no way I could
                    possibly get out of Casablanca under a week. So I had a week in Casablanca and
                    made a visit to Rabat. At the end of the week I flew up to Algiers in a US Army
                    Air Force plane. I spent three days there at a hotel, but saw a great deal of a
                    French Naval Captain and his family who knew friends of mine in Washington. Then
                    I took a Royal South African Air Force plane which was a cargo plane full of
                    Christmas packages. It had no seats, so I sat on some of the packages on the
                    long flight across the desert to Cairo. We finally got into Cairo late at night
                    just a few days before Christmas of 1944. I telephoned the Consulate General in
                    Jerusalem to inform them that I had at least gotten as far as Cairo because the
                    last they had heard of me was sometime in early November. They said, “Oh, we are
                    glad you have gotten this far, but don't you dare come near Jerusalem until
                    after Christmas because no one can do anything about you.” At that time the US
                    Minister was Pinkney Tuck whom I had known in Brussels before the war. His
                    number two was an old friend as well from my days in Latin American affairs,
                    Cecil Lyon. And so I spent Christmas with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even towards the end of the war there were still people
                        coming in there...pilgrims and that sort...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Absolutely. And of course there were enormous numbers of US troops that
                    poured into Palestine, particularly for the Christmas period, Christmas services
                    in Bethlehem. So, the YMCA, which was the one place one could stay, was
                    completely crowded and booked. So I was told to stay out of Jerusalem. I stayed
                    in Cairo for another week and had a wonderful time. I had never been in the Near
                    East and did some sightseeing. I think it was the 27th of December that I
                    finally got a British Royal Air Force plane that took me to Lydda, the Palestine
                    airport.</p>
                <p>I thought I would not wire ahead but just arrive in Jerusalem and go up to the
                    Consulate and present myself. I got to Lydda and the first person I saw, but did
                    not meet, was Field Marshal Lord Gort, the British High Commissioner for
                    Palestine and Transjordan, who had commanded British troops at the beginning of
                    the war and had been in charge at the time of Dunkirk. He was leaving Palestine
                    for good after the termination of his appointment.</p>
                <p>I wondered how I would get to Jerusalem. At that point a very nice British Army
                    officer who saw me sort of stranded said he was going to Jerusalem and offered
                    me a ride. I rode in his car through beautiful country. The orange blossoms were
                    out. It was a beautiful day, cold, but beautiful. We drove on up into the hills
                    and arrived at the Consulate where I presented myself.</p>
                <p>They said they would have met me if I had let them know. Well, I didn't want to
                    bother anybody. I reported to Lowell Pinkerton, who was then the Consul General
                    and to Christian Steeger, who was the number two. I set myself up in the YMCA
                    and there began almost five years in Jerusalem and Amman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in early 1945 in Jerusalem as you
                        saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: The war was still on. The US had camps in Palestine. Of course the
                    British had substantial forces there, although the war had by that time passed
                    on. The Middle East was no longer a theater of operations as such. But there was
                    a Middle East theater but no war operations. It had all shifted basically to
                    Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The Jews and the Arabs were in an uneasy truce during the war. Most of the
                    terrorism and the civil disorder that existed prior to the war had come to an
                    end. There were incidents. The Jews were, of course, bringing in illegal
                    immigrants which was annoying the British and, of course, the Arabs. The Arabs
                    had resented the British efforts even to let some of the Jews in legally and
                    they felt the British were being unfair to the Arabs. The result of that was
                    that there was a certain number of Palestinian Arabs who openly declared
                    themselves for the Nazis. Haj Amin Al-Husseini was the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem
                    and he had indeed thrown his lot in publicly by going to Berlin. He was regarded
                    by the British as a war criminal although he was never brought to trial.</p>
                <p>In spite of these things, the terrorist operations against the British that had
                    been seen in Palestine in the years preceding the war had pretty much come to a
                    halt. Jews and Arabs alike had participated in the war effort. As a matter of
                    fact, just as a matter of interest, there was in Jerusalem an organization
                    called the Middle East Center of Arab Studies which had been set up by the
                    British Foreign Office for purposes of teaching Arabic to British officers who
                    would either stay on in some civil administrative capacity or go in to the
                    Foreign Service. It was run by Colonel Bertram Thomas who had quite a background
                    in the Arabian desert and who spoke Arabic. He was a bit of a four-flusher, but
                    nonetheless he was there. One of his main assistants who spoke absolutely
                    perfect Arabic was a gentleman who was a British Army major, Major Aubrey Eban,
                    who later became Abba Eban. I got to know him quite well.</p>
                <p>So there was a truce. I traveled extensively in Palestine and it was basically
                    perfectly safe for anybody to do that. Curiously enough, it was on the 27th of
                    December, 1945, exactly one year to the day I arrived in Jerusalem, that I
                    almost got blown up. A bomb, Jewish, had been placed in a British police
                    compound. That began again the whole cycle of violence that went on right up
                    until the British got out in May, 1948. The truce had broken down. The Arabs and
                    the Jews started again against each other. The Jews against the British
                    particularly, in protest of British efforts to stop Jewish immigration into
                    Palestine from Europe. Of course, they ran many ships in illegally, beached them
                    and the immigrants would get off and disappear into the Jewish areas of
                    Palestine along the coast.</p>
                <p>The Arabs were aware of this. They objected to it. The level of violence simply
                    escalated. You remember, later on, on July 22, 1946, the King David explosion.
                    The Stern gang, the most violent of the Jewish terrorist groups had brought in
                    milk drums filled with explosives into the basement of the King David Hotel
                    which also housed the British Secretariat for the Mandate and blew it up. It was
                    a ghastly scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first arrived there was this truce going on. What
                        were you doing and what was the main interest of our Consulate General in
                        Jerusalem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STABLER: The main effort, really was, of course, observing what was happening.
                    The Consulate General had the rather unique position of being one of the two
                    Consulate Generals that reported directly to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It and Hong Kong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, it and Hong Kong. The exequaturs were issued by two foreign powers,
                    Great Britain as it related to Palestine and then, even though Transjordan was
                    not independent, we were commissioned as Vice Consuls for Palestine and for
                    Transjordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you covered Transjordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: We covered Transjordan as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which would be today on the other side of Jordan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: At that point it was still an Emirate. There was a British Resident
                    there. Abdullah, present King Hussein's grandfather, was the Emir at the time.
                    But he also had certain authority and we had an exequatur from Transjordan
                    signed by Abdullah, as distinguished from the exequatur signed by King George
                    for Palestine. In 1946, Transjordan became independent.</p>
                <p>In any event, the role of the Consulate General at that time was one of really
                    tracking what was happening there. The Consul General, Mr. Pinkerton, was
                    someone who played his cards quite close to his chest when it came to the
                    substantive side of things. I really never did know to what extent he was turned
                    to for advice as to what we should be doing about Palestine.</p>
                <p>My role at that time was simply as Vice Consul in charge of visas. In addition I
                    handled cultural matters. I used to take films out to kibbutzims and to Arab
                    groups and give little talks about American history, etc. It was interesting
                    going to some of the kibbutzims and showing films produced by OWI on a variety
                    of things related to the United States. The visa work was tremendous. Not so
                    much the first year because no one went anywhere due to strict regulations and
                    lack of transport, but when the war ended there was an overwhelming number of
                    passports, etc. that had to be dealt with in terms of getting people back to the
                    States. There were ships that came in to do this sort of thing. - to take people
                    back who had been stranded.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Shortly after I got to Jerusalem - I believe in very early 1945 - Mr. Pinkerton
                    apparently had learned that the Emir of Transjordan was unhappy with him
                    because, although he was accredited to Transjordan, he never went there. He
                    decided that he better go down and see the Emir. Abdullah had winter quarters in
                    Shuneh in the Jordan Valley, on the other side of the Jordan River, not very far
                    from Jericho. The Emir was down there and Pinkerton decided he would go down,
                    but he seemed to think he needed an excuse to go down. The excuse was to present
                    me as a new Vice Consul.</p>
                <p>We went down on February 14, 1945. Again - to me who was just 26 - it was pretty
                    heady stuff seeing an Emir. Abdullah was very nice and it was very pleasant
                    visit. The following Sunday I decided that I would go back down and personally
                    sign the book. I got down to Shuneh and was very much impressed by all these
                    Arab Legion soldiers who would snap to attention and salute when they saw a
                    consular license plate - actually I flew an American flag. When I got to the
                    Winter Quarters I said to one of the guards, who came out to ask what I wanted,
                    that I wanted to sign the book. He disappeared and came back a few minutes later
                    and said, “I am terribly sorry the book is in Amman, but the Emir is here -
                    would you like to see him?” I said that that would be splendid. So I went in and
                    had a nice chat with Abdullah through an interpreter - I spoke no Arabic then -
                    and told him how impressed I had been by the Arab Legion that I had seen along
                    the roads. He said, “Well, I am having a maneuver in about three weeks time and
                    I would like you to come as my guest.” I said, “That is very kind of you, Your
                    Highness. Of course, I would like to come.”</p>
                <p>After three weeks I had still heard nothing at all. One morning I was in the file
                    room of the Consulate hunting for some document and came across a letter from
                    Glubb Pasha who was then the British Commander of Arab Legion, addressed to
                    Pinkerton. Glubb wrote that the Emir was holding a maneuver on such and such a
                    day and had commanded him to invite Pinkerton to come to the maneuver. I was
                    crestfallen that I had been forgotten by my new friend, Emir Abdullah.</p>
                <p>The appointed day for the maneuver came and I went quite early to my office in
                    what used to be affectionately called “the turnip shed” of the Consulate
                    General—a horrible little shed that was attached to the main building and heated
                    by a big potbelly stove. I had been in my office not more than 15 or 20 minutes
                    when the phone rang. It was Mr. Pinkerton down at the Winter Quarters saying,
                    “You get on down here as quickly as you can. The Emir said that the invitation
                    was for you and he won't start the maneuver until you get here.” I thought to
                    myself, “that's a lot of fun, but the end of my career.”</p>
                <p>I pulled myself together and drove down. As luck would have it I got a flat tire
                    and got stuck in the sand somewhere. By the time I finally got to the maneuver
                    it was over. The Emir was very nice and invited Mr. Pinkerton and me to lunch in
                    his tent.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>That was the beginning of a long relationship and friendship that I had with
                    Abdullah and his son, Crown Prince Talal who reigned very briefly after Abdullah
                    was assassinated, and his grandson, the present King Hussein.</p>

                        This must have been sort of annoying to Mr. Pinkerton wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, curiously enough you would have thought it would have, but it
                    really didn't seem to. I think in a sense he was somewhat relieved that he
                    didn't have to worry about Transjordan. He wasn't that interested in it. He
                    didn't really enjoy going over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Pinkerton was a Career Foreign Service Officer. He had been in
                    Personnel, had been somewhat of an administrator. I cannot now remember where he
                    came from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was an Arabist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, he spoke no Arabic. I don't think he spoke any foreign language at
                    all. He got along well with the British, -they liked him. But he had no real
                    interest in Transjordan. When Abdullah became King of the newly-independent
                    Transjordan in 1946, Pinkerton was invited to attend the ceremonies along with
                    the other Consuls General in Jerusalem accredited to Transjordan. I was the only
                    Vice Consul invited personally by the Emir to come to his Independence Day
                    celebrations, including the Palace function and the big parade at the airfield
                    on May 25, 1946. By that time I was fully known in Jordan and was regarded
                    really sort of the US presence, if you will. I don't think Pinkerton really
                    resented it. If he did, he never said anything, nor did he try to curtail my
                    activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I had lots of things that I did in Jerusalem. I had become by then a good friend
                    of the new High Commissioner, General Sir Alan Cunningham, and his staff. I
                    generally had a pretty good position in the Palestine government, although I
                    didn't really deal with the political side of it. When the Anglo-American
                    Committee of Inquiry came to Jerusalem in 1946, the British were already
                    discussing what they should do with Palestine as it was becoming more and more
                    of a burden for them. Violence was continuing and escalating. There was the
                    problem of Jews in Europe. They eventually said that something had to be done.
                    They suggested a group go to Palestine, including Americans, to see what could
                    be done about it. So the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry was appointed and
                    the senior US delegate was William Phillips, a former Under Secretary of State
                    and Ambassador to Rome in the early part of the war before we went into it, and
                    whose wife was my godmother. So Pinkerton assigned me to look after that
                    Delegation. I also was given the responsibility for acting as escort for quite a
                    few Congressional delegations that came to Palestine. Jack Javits was one of
                    them who came.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Absolutely, a very fine person. There were a number of others. So I
                    wasn't ostracized or cut out by Pinkerton, although I did not play any role in
                    political substantive work. He did that entirely himself. He never showed us any
                    of his messages that he sent back and forth on substantive questions. He played
                    it all very close to his chest. I never quite understood why he didn't take some
                    of us into his confidence, but he didn't.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, that was in July 1946 - the King David explosion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, at that time, were you under any constraints about

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, not at all. I traveled extensively and saw lots of both sides. I did
                    a good deal of work on the Arab side too. But I never ever prepared, curious
                    enough, during the period Pinkerton was there, any sort of political report. I
                    went around extensively and talked to people, but my role was not that of a
                    political reporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is odd. In other words, the younger officers who

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>STABLER: No. We had Pinkerton, a commercial man named Malcolm Hooper, an officer
                    who handled American citizen passports, etc., an OSS representative, and two of
                    us who did visa work. Pinkerton was the only one who did the political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting because what you are saying is that
                        Pinkerton was not a particularly experienced political reporting
                        officer.STABLER: I don't really recall what his background was. My
                        recollection was that it was more administrative—personnel. He was quite
                        well regarded. Pinkerton and his wife, Marion, left Jerusalem in 1947 while
                        I was home on leave. Pinkerton went as Minister to The Lebanon and ended up
                        later, I believe, before he retired, as Ambassador to the Sudan. Loy
                        Henderson, the top man in Middle East affairs, had regard for him. But I
                        never really had any idea of what Pinkerton did politically because I never
                        saw a report. Robert Macatee, whom I mentioned earlier, and his wife came as
                        Consul General during the summer of 1947, before I had returned from the
                        US.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, it is hard to recreate the time, but it really
                        took a decade or so for the real enormity of what had happened to the Jews
                        and others in Europe during the war to really sink in. The Foreign Service
                        came pretty much from the educated class in the United States and was not
                        particularly responsive to the Jew in the United States. I can recall
                        hearing, not so much in college, but in prep school, anti-Semitic jokes. At
                        that time, particularly with turmoil obviously beginning to come with ships
                        docking all the time, was there an annoyance with the Zionist movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: For one thing, for those of us who were serving in Palestine, it was
                    clear that in demographic sense that the majority of the residents of Palestine
                    were Arabs. There were about a million and a half people in Palestine of which
                    about a million were Arabs and roughly 500,000 were Jews. So in the demographic
                    sense, the majority was clearly Arab. On the other hand, as you drove around
                    Palestine, which I did extensively, at all hours of the day and night, you
                    couldn't help but marvel at what the Jews had produced in their part of
                    Palestine along the coast in particular. It was a miracle what they had done
                    agriculturally and to some extent industrially. They, of course, had done this
                    aggressively because it wasn't easy to do. They worked terribly hard. They were
                    aggressive, of course, in terms of what they hoped to ultimately achieve. One
                    probably didn't know at the outside a great deal of what had been happening in
                    terms of the genocide in Germany. I happened to live part of the time in
                    Jerusalem in a small apartment in a Jewish house. The owner was a marvelous
                    woman who was a Dutch Jewess, and who, after I left, unhappily was killed in one
                    of these horrible terrorist actions where the Arabs shot up the bus in which she
                    was in. You couldn't help but have great admiration at what they had done, but
                    also you recognized that there was this constant encroachment on what was a
                    demographic majority in the area. You couldn't help but be rather disgusted by
                    some of the terrorism they pulled off in Palestine. A lot of one's British
                    friends were killed as a result of incidents like King David, etc.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which includes some of the people who later, like Menachem
                        Begin and the present Prime Minister, Shamir.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. Menachem Begin at that time was someone who had a big price on his
                    head. There was the Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern gang. There was someone - I
                    think his name was Sartori - who was the Ford representative in Jerusalem and
                    also represented, I think, the Palestine Potash Company at the Dead Sea. He was
                    socially everywhere. Everybody knew him. The day the British left Jerusalem, May
                    15, 1948, he turned out to have been all that time one of the important members
                    of the Stern gang. Various Jewish leaders with whom I eventually dealt - like
                    Moshe Dyan who was a very aggressive, abrasive individual, very difficult to
                    deal with, but at that particular point fighting for Israel's survival - were
                    all deeply involved in making Israel a going concern.</p>
                <p>There was this constant sort of friction involving British, Jews and Arabs which
                    got fairly tiring. I have to admit it was very hard to be entirely neutral. You
                    invariably felt more one way than you did another way, although our official
                    position was that of being entirely neutral between the two. I always cite what
                    happened to me on the 15th of May, 1948 when the British left as evidence of my
                    following instructions to the letter. When I was caught in the crossfire between
                    the Jews on one side of the street and the Arabs on the other side I ended up
                    with 37 bullet holes in my car, and still being alive at least I was neutral to
                    the extent of saying, “Who shot at me?” It was very tense. You had the feeling
                    that the British administration was more sympathetic to the Arab cause than the
                    Jewish cause. And the Jews knew that.</p>
                <p>We had difficult moments. The Consulate General was not very far from the
                    building of the Jewish Agency. One morning there was an enormous explosion. It
                    was quite clear that it had come from the Jewish Agency. One was sorry that this
                    had occurred but we were even sorrier when we realized to our absolute horror
                    that the Consulate car had disappeared. What had happened was that one of our
                    Arab drivers had taken the Consular car, had it loaded with explosives, drove
                    into the Jewish Agency courtyard (allowed in because of the Consulate plates),
                    got out, disappeared and the car blew up. So it was the Consulate car that was
                    responsible for a lot of damage, fortunately nobody was killed. Our driver
                    vanished and eventually we learned that he had ended up in Honduras. I went
                    there some years later and discovered there was a large Palestine population
                    there.</p>
                <p>So there was this constant tension that existed which took its toll on people. It
                    was hard on people - there were curfews, bombings and god knows what. After the
                    Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry those things went on, and the British
                    finally said enough is enough and turned the Palestine problem over to the
                    UN.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a change in the atmospherics within the
                        operation? You knew you were getting ready for a cataclysmic event.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, there was because Pinkerton went off as Minister to Beirut before
                    we had embassies. Robert Macatee came out from the Department. I don't now
                    remember what other jobs he had had. I knew him before when he was Assistant
                    Chief of Personnel in 1941. We are talking about five or six years later. I
                    think he came from Washington at the time. He was quite different. By that time
                    I had been there for going on three years and was probably, with the exception
                    of the OSS fellow...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the equivalent to our CIA people later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. There was just one man who was dressed as an American major. He was
                    known by the British, obviously, for what he was.</p>
                <p>I had been there for quite a few years by then and had become more involved in
                    the substantive side of things and would do occasional political reporting.
                    Although I must say I didn't do a great deal when it came...well, now that is
                    not true, I did do a great deal more, and then became sort of the political
                    advisor, if you will, along with the OSS fellow who became political advisor to
                    Macatee on a great many things.</p>
                <p>Yes, he was there before the UN General Assembly Partition Resolution of
                    September 1947 because I remember that shortly after that Resolution had been
                    approved Frances Bolton, who was then a Member of Congress from Ohio, came out
                    on a visit to sort of test the waters. She was rather pro-Arab basically and was
                    somewhat annoyed with this Resolution because again we were talking about a
                    country which had a majority of Arabs and here they were dividing it up and
                    giving part of it to the Jews. So Macatee was there at the time because a few of
                    us, including one of the Macatees' daughters, went in Mrs. Bolton's US Air Force
                    plane to Cyprus for two days.</p>
                <p>Partition came along because the British said, “We have enough of this. We are
                    getting out in 1948 and you had better do something before then because, if you
                    don't, there won't be anybody here and there will be total chaos.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this really in a way a message to the Americans. I
                        mean to say, “Here you Americans have been talking about Jewish homeland,
                        etc. and this is your problem.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: The Jewish homeland was what the British, themselves, had been talking
                    about, the Balfour Declaration of 1917. But by 1947 there was clearly increased
                    pressure in the United States because of what had happened in Germany which by
                    then was fully known. There was real pressure of what do you do? We were not
                    prepared to open up our immigration to let them all come into the States, so the
                    next question was, “Where do they go?” By this time clearly the Zionist movement
                    had decided that Palestine must become the national home for the Jews.
                    Everything that they did was aimed at that time in terms of immigration to get
                    them into Palestine. This was becoming a tremendously difficult thing for the
                    British who had a large army, several divisions of troops, in Palestine. After
                    all it is not a very large country, about 140 miles long and 70 miles wide. They
                    had a tremendous concentration of first- class British troops. And a fairly
                    sizable police force which was composed of British, and both Jews and Arabs, but
                    the leadership was all British.</p>
                <p>I think you are quite right that part of it certainly was directed to the United
                    States. The British said, “We couldn't find anything through the Anglo-American
                    Committee of Inquiry; no one can come up with any solution; we don't want to
                    have anything to do with this; we can't cope with it; we are getting out; so do
                    what you will, we aren't going to be here.”</p>
                <p>The UN came up with the Partition Resolution which, of course, was strongly
                    resented by the Arabs. I was advised - again I would make a good many trips
                    across the Jordan to Amman to see what was happening there - by the British that
                    when I went over there I should take my car and have two Arab Legion soldiers
                    with submachine guns sitting in my back seat. I did this and got over to Amman
                    and my Jordanian friends asked why I was doing this as I was well known and no
                    one would do anything. They thought it was sort of an insult to come with two
                    Arab Legion guards. So, I never had them again and nothing happened.</p>
                <p>But there was very strong resentment. Time bombs increased and we recognized, of
                    course, that the day would come before very long, this was 1947, that the
                    British would be out and where would we be. So we decided that in terms of
                    safeguarding the Consulate we would have the British come and give us an expert
                    estimate as to what it would need to guard the Consulate. They came up with a
                    figure of 285 marines, which would be 24 hours guard service plus road escorts.
                    Macatee sent a telegram to Washington saying that, in terms of the future, here
                    is what has been recommended. Washington obviously went into a dead faint
                    because they never answered it.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>In their wisdom, of which there wasn't any - literally I think it was about a
                    week before the British left - the Department suddenly threw on top of us
                    something like 30 civilian guards - young men who after the war, not knowing
                    what to do, had answered some sort of ad and signed up as embassy guards. They
                    came from all walks of life. One man had ended up as head of the commissary in
                    Rome, but still was a guard and found himself in Jerusalem wondering what the
                    hell he was doing there. None of them knew how to shoot a gun. I had to take
                    them out personally to a range, although I had never shot a Tommy gun, to teach
                    them how to shoot Tommy guns. They were totally undisciplined. In addition to
                    that, all of a sudden Washington sent us a 10 or 12 man Navy communication team,
                    which was very useful, and which turned out to be the only way we could keep
                    communications with Washington going. I think we had in the Consulate General 15
                    of these civilian guards who were very nice young man but who were basically
                    undisciplined. They drank quite a lot, one of them got mad at me one evening and
                    chased me with a machine gun. It was really chaotic.</p>
                <p>We had asked for an armored vehicle for the Consul General - a United Nations
                    Security Council Truce Commission had been set up which was made up of Consul
                    Generals from France, Belgian and the United States. The meetings were usually
                    held at the French Consulate General, which was right under the walls of the Old
                    City. In order for our Consul General to get back and forth he had to go in a
                    car without armor or walk. So we requested an armored car. They said they
                    couldn't send a car but could send an armored personnel carrier which doesn't
                    have any armor on top, it just has armor on the side with a canvas top. We never
                    got that either. The result was that the Consul General was killed coming back
                    from a meeting in the French Consulate general. So, the fact of the matter is,
                    that the Department of State was totally unprepared to deal with anything of
                    this sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Mr. Pinkerton left you were able to get a little
                        better feel for the relations. Were instructions coming in from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: We were rather left out of the loop on these things. There were a lot of
                    conversations between London and Washington to which we were not privy . So a
                    lot of these things were being done without our knowing what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as an aside because people sometime forget how things
                        are. There was no embassy in Tel Aviv, there was no embassy in Amman or
                        anything like that. You were it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>STABLER: I jumped ahead a little bit because I talked about the Consul General
                    being killed by sniper fire. In February or March the Department had decided
                    that married men would not stay in Jerusalem and that a new Consul general, Tom
                    Wasson, who was single would be transferred from Athens. He arrived on April 1,
                    1948 and Macatee and family left on April 16. It was not Macatee, but Tom Wasson
                    who was killed. The irony was that Wasson was wearing a bulletproof vest, but
                    the bullet went into the side of his arm and through his body, but was prevented
                    from coming out by the vest.</p>
                <p>But no, Tel Aviv didn't exist as far as a US post was concerned. There wasn't a
                    Jordan because we had never recognized Jordan, or Transjordan as it was then
                    still called.. I was the only contact with Transjordan. I was no longer
                    accredited to Transjordan because it had gained independence and there was an
                    accredited Diplomatic Corps in Amman. I traveled there as a friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no mission in Jordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There was nothing at all. The only thing that existed was the Consulate
                    General in Jerusalem. I don't have any recollection that we were really
                    consulted a great deal on these things or that we had much of an input on
                    Partition or were asked very much about what we thought about these things. I
                    don't recall that we were kept up on the happenings in the UN. Things would
                    happen and we would not have had advanced knowledge of what was going to happen.
                    So we were really cut out of the loop. I suppose the High Commissioner was being
                    queried because the British are better about these things then we are, I think.
                    Most of what we knew was gleaned from the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During my last job I was seconded to the Historian's
                        Office. Among other things I did a history of our Consulate General in
                        Jerusalem. In the 1920s after the Balfour Declaration had come out, our
                        officers there...the Jewish community was small and I think there was a
                        certain antipathy towards the Zionist movement, a pro-Arab feeling ...were
                        reporting again and again saying, “Zionism is all fine, but a homeland here
                        means blood on the streets, and this is just not going to happen.” Their
                        predictions, of course, are true, there has been a tremendous amount of
                        fighting which continues really to this day. Were you able to give reports
                        saying that this was going to be a blood bath?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, one was giving Washington reporting of the views of various
                    communities on this subject—the Arabs and the Jews and some of the religious
                    leaders who have an interest in all of this, and also the views of the British.
                    We reported on what was actually happening there—the various acts of terrorism,
                    the strong feelings of the various Jewish and Arab communities who foretold the
                    events as well as they could - keeping Washington not only abreast of what was
                    happening, but what probably would happen if certain things were done.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Again, Pinkerton, I don't know what he said. I do know - because we did do a lot
                    of reporting after Macatee got there in which I was involved giving various
                    points of view and letting them know actually the tensions that were existing
                    between the communities and what might happen if certain things were done. And
                    then, of course, after the Partition, we brought them up to date on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to Partition. In your reporting did you feel any
                        concern about...okay, if you report this, this report might be looked with
                        disfavor by both the Jewish community and those sympathetic, there was still
                        a residue of the New Deal Administration which had had very strong Jewish
                        support...did you feel any constraints?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think Pinkerton may have felt some constraints because he was a very
                    cautious man and didn't want to upset anybody particularly. It may be that some
                    of that could have come through in his reporting. After him there was a greater
                    openness in expressing points of view. I mean not worrying about the political
                    side. One tried to call the shots such as they were. The Arabs expressed very
                    strong views about things, those views would be reported without regard to
                    whether they would upset somebody or not. By the same token the views of the
                    Jewish Agency, the official Jews, were also reported, plus the British who were
                    more apt to favor the Arab cause than the Zionist cause. But I don't think
                    political considerations entered into this reporting at all. Although one knew
                    what the feelings were in Washington with the Department of State on one side
                    and the political aspects on the other side. But when the time came for Truman
                    to make his decision to recognize Israel de facto on the first day the British
                    had left, I can assure you that we were neither consulted nor informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think anybody was informed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I don't think anybody was. Although the effort was made at that
                    particular time to persuade the President that if he was going to recognize
                    Israel de facto that he could temper it by recognizing Transjordan de facto,
                    even though Transjordan had been independent since 1946 and we are talking about
                    1948. The President declined to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem about not recognizing Jordan then? Was
                        it budgetary or was there...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>STABLER: No, I think when Transjordan became independent no one in Washington
                    really bothered to think about recognizing it, regarding it pretty much as a
                    British affair. In 1948 it was entirely a political thing. The President made
                    the decision that this would have to be aimed at Israel and not be tempered in
                    any way by also recognizing an Arab state. By that time the general outrage of
                    the Arab world had already been felt with respect to what was happening with
                    Partition. Therefore it probably would have been regarded by the Jews as
                    insulting if we had tried to balance their recognition by recognizing an Arab
                    state. So he declined to do that and it was only in January, 1949, when we
                    recognized Israel de jure that the decision was made to recognize Transjordan de
                    jure at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to stop at the Partition time where we will pick it
                        up later. One last question. What was your feeling and those at the
                        Consulate General about the British letting go? Were you thinking, “Oh my
                        god, they have a responsibility, and shouldn't get out.” or “Obviously they
                        can't control the situation and lets see where the chips fall.”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Obviously everybody recognized there would be utter chaos and almost
                    anarchy once the British left. It was well known as a result of everything that
                    had transpired before—the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry and then various
                    UN studies, etc. and the British statement that they were getting out. One can
                    sympathize with the British because this had become an enormous burden to bear,
                    extremely expensive in terms of money and lives with no returns, which they had
                    been carrying on for a great many years. There was no way that they were going
                    to be persuaded to stay on. Pressure was brought to bear on them to stay on.
                    They may have considered it for a while, but by that time the Labor Government
                    had come in and I think that they finally just realized that there was no way
                    they could do it or really wanted to do it.</p>
                <p>We all knew that Partition wasn't going to be viable because everybody was
                    against it. It was a big unknown that we were embarking on the day that the
                    British pulled out. But the political situation had reached the point where
                    there was no alternative. They wouldn't stay and the UN had no ability or
                    capacity to put a force in there. It was just one of these machines that
                    gathered speed and there was no stopping it. The United States had no power to
                    stop it either because we were behind the Partition scheme. We certainly weren't
                    going to take over from the British. Domestically it was quite clear that this
                    was what the Jews wanted because this was the creation by partition of the
                    homeland. As it turned out they got the whole thing.</p>
                <p>We knew in the Consulate General that there was the Hagganah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Jewish army.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, that was the Jewish army. It was illegal, but the British didn't do
                    much about it. They knew it was there and had some utility in the defense of
                    kibbutzims and things of that sort. They got their arms helter-skelter by
                    stealing from British ammunition depots and things of that sort. That was sort
                    of the unofficial army. Then there was the Stern Gang and the Irgun Zvai Leumi.
                    The Irgun Zvai Leumi was the larger group and the Stern gang the smaller group.
                    They also existed. One knew that the Jewish Agency ran a fairly efficient
                    operation and the assumption was that the Hagganah would acquit itself pretty
                    well in the struggle against the Arabs.</p>
                <p>But as you added up the Arab manpower - the armies of the Arab countries - it was
                    hard, frankly, to see how in the final analysis the Jews would be able to
                    withstand this onslaught. Added to this, of course, was the view in all the Arab
                    capitals—American representatives in all the Arab capitals were reporting that
                    this better not happen because the Jews would be pushed into the sea. At times
                    the war between our representative, James McDonald, in Tel Aviv and our
                    representatives in the Arab countries was worse than the fighting because those
                    in Arab countries took one side and McDonald the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: On the 15th of May when Truman recognized Israel de facto, we set up a
                    diplomatic representative's office in Tel Aviv. James Grover McDonald came to
                    Tel Aviv as the first American representative. Although he was not an ambassador
                    in the strict sense of the word, he was the American Representative in this de
                    facto situation. The office was set up in Tel Aviv indeed as if it were an
                    Embassy with communications. Messages would be repeated from Tel Aviv to our
                    Embassies in Arab capitals and often to us.</p>
                <p>As I say, on paper it certainly looked as if there was no way the Israelis could
                    withstand the Arab onslaught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop here and we will start again with May
                        15.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 19, 1991. This is a continuation interview
                        with Ambassador Wells Stabler. Mr. Ambassador, we were last time talking
                        about the Partition of Palestine. Can we focus on what you were doing at the
                        time of the Partition, on May 15..?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, May 15 was when the British left in 1948. Partition was the previous
                    year in September 1947.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then when the British left, because I...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: They are two distinct things. The Partition was the United Nations
                    resolution to divide Palestine into two Jewish and two Arab states. Maybe we
                    went over that last time. If we did, then lets take it up from May 15, 1948.</p>
                <p>When the British pulled out of Jerusalem - they pulled out of Palestine a day or
                    two later because they moved with the High Commissioner up to Haifa and had an
                    enclave there and then they shortly afterwards pulled out completely.</p>
                <p>In any event, May 15, 1948 I was at the Consulate General. The staff there by
                    that time had been reduced by many. Those of us who were there were all
                    bachelors including the Consul General, Tom Wasson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might mention at this time that it was the policy in
                        those days that when trouble started you got rid of the families and also,
                        if possible, you put bachelor officers into a place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, it certainly was the policy as far as Jerusalem was concerned. We
                    had a number of married officers there and they were all transferred. Those of
                    us who remained were bachelors and there were, I think, several officers who
                    were brought from other posts for temporary duty who were bachelors. For
                    example, Stuart Rockwell, who also became an Ambassador later on, was in the
                    Embassy in Ankara and was detailed as one of the officers to augment our staff.
                    And then there were one or two others, but I don't offhand remember who they
                    were.</p>
                <p>In any event, early on the morning of May 15, Major Andronovich - Nick
                    Andronovich - who by then was the CIA representative in Jerusalem, and I drove
                    out in my personal car. The Consulate General by that time had no car because it
                    had been blown up—I think I mentioned it last time. We drove out to a little
                    airstrip called Kalondia between Jerusalem and Ramallah and found there a small
                    plane and British troops drawn up in battle array with a battery of field
                    artillery with guns aiming in the direction of Jerusalem. In due course the High
                    Commissioner arrived - Sir Alan Cunningham, who was a friend. He was received
                    with full honors at the little airstrip. After saying good-bye to me and
                    Andronovich and to his staff, he took off in his little plane headed for Haifa.
                    The guns were hitched up and bit by bit the British forces also departed.</p>
                <p>In a very short period of time Andronovich and I were left standing on an
                    extremely empty airfield feeling really quite lonely, because with the departure
                    of the British forces all public security in Jerusalem had come to an end. There
                    was no neutral police force, no security provided by a third element, that is to
                    say, Jews, Arab and the British.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Andronovich and I drove back into Jerusalem and I came to the Consulate General
                    and found sitting on the steps going up to the office a group of members of the
                    staff including civilian guards who had recently come in and one other officer,
                    Bob Houghton, by name, who is dead now. They were all rather irritated because
                    they had wanted to go up to the hotel which was not too far from the Consulate
                    General on the main streets near the YMCA. When they had walked in that
                    direction they had been shot at. The British had gone, and public order had
                    completely collapsed. They went back to the Consulate General and asked to
                    borrow a car which was refused them. They didn't want to risk walking up there
                    again and being shot at.</p>
                <p>I said, “Look here, I have my car with a couple of flags on it. Hop in the car
                    and I will drive you up there.” This was around noon time on the 15th. In they
                    got along with me and my little dachshund. We drove up the street around the
                    corner from the Consulate General and almost in no time we started getting shot
                    at. I drove the car right up on the sidewalk and let the people in the car get
                    out. They almost felt into the hotel.</p>
                <p>As soon as they had gotten out I started driving up the street towards the YMCA.
                    At this point I was taken under machine gun fire—on one side by the Jews and the
                    other side by the Arabs. I decided it was a no-win situation and backed my car
                    down again on the sidewalk and came really within a hairbreadth of having a
                    bullet right through my head. It was scary. I was able to get out and fall into
                    this hotel, literally.</p>
                <p>There we were stuck for over 24 hours. That night-there was virtually no food in
                    the hotel, there were no lights and we were concerned that during the night that
                    either a Jewish or Arab patrol might come in to this hotel and shoot first and
                    ask questions later. Things were very tense at that time and the Jews and the
                    Arabs were really after each other.</p>
                <p>It was while we were all sitting in that hotel—we did have a battery radio or
                    some sort of communication—that we learned that Mr. Truman had announced the de
                    facto recognition of Israel, which made us all even more nervous because this
                    was the area where there were quite a few Arabs around and we didn't think that
                    decision would be very popular.</p>
                <p>In any event while we were there one, possibly two, of the men who were with us
                    there, part of the Consulate staff, got rather antsy about being cooped up and
                    without my knowledge or permission - I was the senior officer there - went out
                    onto the street and were promptly shot. Fortunately, neither of them were killed
                    and were picked up by Red Crescent ambulances (very brave ambulance people
                    indeed) and taken off to hospitals. One of them was a civilian guard who was
                    well into his 60s by this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the type of person they sent out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>STABLER: This was the sort of harebrained scheme they thought up in Washington.
                    Ages went all the way from the 60's down to the early 20's. This gentleman was
                    in his 60's.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he was taken away and, of course, we had no idea where. At that point we
                    didn't know whether he was dead or alive. I think there may have been two,
                    certainly there was one.</p>
                <p>In any event, in due course, the people at the Consulate General were able to
                    arrange with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had people in
                    Jerusalem at that time trying to help in keeping some semblance of humanity in
                    all of this - they were able to arrange with them to come down to the hotel from
                    the YMCA and under the protection of a Red Cross flag—I think these were mostly
                    Swiss and extremely brave men because this was a wide open street absolutely
                    visible from any sort of sniper's post. They came down by small groups and began
                    removing the people in this hotel. Being senior officer I was the last to leave.
                    Just before I left they started mowing the streets with bullets of one sort or
                    another so we had to hold up awhile.We all got out and went back via the YMCA to
                    the Consulate General. Those were the events of May 15.</p>
                <p>There then began a period of one month in which really we were under siege—the
                    whole of Jerusalem really. The Arab Legion had occupied the Old City and were
                    lobbing mortar shells into the New City. We lived there at the Consulate General
                    with our own generator. We had a naval communications unit which was just across
                    an alley way in a convent. We had this sort of guard force that would shoot
                    street lights out and do all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>During that period we had a number of casualties. One of the naval communicators
                    at one point was walking behind the Consulate General, I don't know why he was
                    there after dark, and, of course, ran across a patrol, we don't know whether it
                    was Jews or Arabs, and was shot. He eventually died. Two of the guards, two
                    young men, heard screams and went out behind the Consulate into this no-man's
                    land and brought Walker, I think that was his name, back into the Consulate. We
                    had a US Public Health doctor, Jeff Freyman, assigned to the Consulate General
                    at that time. He was able to give first aid and got him into a hospital.
                    Eventually, I am sorry to say, Walker died.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The Consul General, Tom Wasson, was a member of the Security Council Truce
                    Commission which was composed of the United States, France and Belgium, as I
                    remember, and was suppose to keep in touch with the Jewish and Arab communities
                    with the idea of somehow getting a truce from the fighting that was going on,
                    which was very wide spread. The Egyptians had come into Gaza, the Iraqis had
                    marched a division into Palestine, the Syrians had fiddled about a little bit up
                    in the north, the Arab Legion had occupied the West Bank and the Old City. The
                    Truce Commission met in the French Consulate which was just under the Walls of
                    the Old City. I think earlier I had mentioned that we had asked the Department
                    to send an armored vehicle and it chose not to. So Wasson was obliged to walk
                    this distance, which was relatively far and fairly open between the Consulate
                    General and the French Consulate. On his way back from one of these meetings as
                    he was crossing a street just behind the Consulate - and the irony of it all was
                    that he was wearing a bulletproof vest - a sniper, and to this day no one really
                    knows whether it was Jewish or Arab, shot him in the arm which was the one area
                    that was not protected by the vest. We got him to the hospital, but he died very
                    shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>At the time Wasson was hit I was in the Consulate General, the only officer there
                    at the moment. We had a number of communications facilities at that point. We
                    had the navy and a special CIA/OSS operator who had a post on the roof of the
                    building. Incidentally, he was also later wounded in a mortar attack. I had to
                    decide who was going to be the acting Consul General. We had Bill Burdett who
                    was assigned there and was next senior to Wasson on the Consulate staff; we had
                    Stuart Rockwell from Ankara who was on temporary duty but senior in rank to
                    Burdett. But I made the decision that the officer permanently assigned to
                    Jerusalem, although junior in rank to Rockwell, should be the acting Consul
                    General. I sent the message informing the Department that Consul General Wasson
                    had been shot and seriously injured and that “I have assumed charge”, signing it
                    “Burdett”. So Bill Burdett indeed was acting Consul General for several months
                    until a replacement came.</p>
                <p>So, during that period we were pretty much holed up. You could get around and
                    some people lived outside the Consulate General. I lived in the Consulate
                    General and slept with telephone and Tommy gun by my bed. We ate “Ten-in-One”
                    rations that had been brought in before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ten-in-One rations being a military combat type of
                        ration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. Enough food for one man for ten days or for ten men for one day,
                    something of that sort. The US Air Force had flown in a supply from Germany, I
                    recall, some days before the British left.</p>

                <p>STABLER: Not the greatest, but it was the only food we had because all the
                    markets were closed.</p>
                <p>Finally in mid-June 1948 the UN was able to arrange a 30-day cease-fire and Count
                    Bernadotte, the UN Mediator, came to Jerusalem. The guns were silenced and
                    people began to go out in the streets. I made a quick trip to Amman, using a
                    rather circuitous route around behind the Old City. During the month of
                    cease-fire, Washington finally decided that the US should have some form of
                    representation stationed in Amman. Even though I had been in Jerusalem going on
                    to four years, it was clear that I was the only person who had the contacts in
                    Jordan, starting with Abdullah. Consequently, I was detailed to Amman. Since we
                    had not recognized Jordan, I could not go as a US diplomat. The Department came
                    up with a ridiculously long and complicated title “The Liaison Officer to the
                    American Member of the Security Council Truce Commission”. I only used the title
                    once in Amman, and after that I was always known as “The American
                    Representative”.</p>
                <p>In any event, in mid-July I packed myself and my dachshund into my car and headed
                    off to Amman. Again I had to take a long route because the Allenby Bridge over
                    the Jordan had been closed. After a long drive I arrived in Amman and
                    immediately went to the Palace to see the King and to report to him that I would
                    be in Amman permanently. I told him what my title would be. As it turned out,
                    when I arrived at the Palace, Abdullah was in conference with the Prince Regent
                    of Iraq, Emir Abdulillah, and with the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nuri Said Pasha.
                    These gentlemen had just returned from Cairo where the Arab League had decided
                    to resume the war with Israel that very day. Abdullah was distraught. He
                    implored me to inform Washington that it must do everything to stop the
                    fighting, since, as he put it, if the Arab Legion should be mauled and defeated
                    by the Israelis, his position in Jordan and the Arab world would be destroyed. I
                    promised that I would transmit his views, although at that moment I had neither
                    codes nor any form of communication with Washington. As I recall, a US plane,
                    either Air Force or Navy, came to Amman the next day, and I was able to get them
                    to take my message to Cairo to be repeated.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, the next morning after my arrival, I went to see Sir Alec
                    Kirkbride, the British Minister, whom I had got to know well, along with his
                    family, during my many previous trips to Jordan. I told him that I would be
                    living permanently in Amman and mentioned my title. Yes, said Kirkbride, he had
                    seen the King a few hours earlier who had told him of my visit the previous
                    evening and that, yes, I had mentioned some sort of title. The King said he
                    could not possibly remember what it was, but that he was glad that I, as the
                    American Representative, had come to Amman for good. My position there used to
                    irritate some of the accredited diplomatic representatives, particularly when I
                    would show up for official functions. Some of them complained, but were sharply
                    told that the King would have whomever he wanted at Palace functions and that I
                    was welcome.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>And so began a thirteen month tour in Amman. For the first months I was all
                    alone, living in the Philadelphia Hotel. Ultimately, I was able to get a house
                    which also served as an office, and a male clerk was detailed from Jerusalem. It
                    was a most interesting period for me, since, in effect, I was, at a fairly young
                    age, a Chief of Mission. I saw a great deal of Abdullah and his Government, and
                    formed a close friendship with the Crown Prince, Emir Talal. I also met Talal's
                    son, the present King Hussein, who was then about eleven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Abdullah hadn't been around a lot but seemed to have more
                        of a world view then many. Did he use you as a sounding board to find out
                        what this peculiar place, the United States was? Because America really had
                        very little influence in that area, the Middle East, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There wasn't a great deal. We began to have a good deal more. We had
                    some degree of influence, but not north because obviously Iraq was the British
                    sphere, and Lebanon and Syria were more or less the French sphere. Very shortly
                    after I got to Jerusalem there was the uprising in Syria and the French were
                    eventually pushed out.</p>
                <p>Abdullah was interested, of course, in the political views of the United States.
                    I don't think he ever quite understood why he wasn't regarded more favorably by
                    the States. The fact there was no recognition obviously galled him. He assumed,
                    in a way - as he regarded the American President as an important figure that the
                    American President by like token regarded him Abdullah as an important figure,
                    which of course obviously wasn't the case. He had that sort of a vision of the
                    world where he saw himself in a larger role than he really had. This also was
                    somewhat likened to what he regarded as his role vis-a-vis the British Queen.
                    The British did look upon Jordan in their way as an important element and he
                    looked at the Queen as a fellow monarch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually it would have been the King.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, you are right. I was flying across the Channel in 1950 when I got
                    word that the King had died. So it was the King.</p>
                <p>He had very little idea of what made our country tick. I think that he was well
                    aware of the rather strong domestic political influence of the American Jewish
                    community which, of course, distressed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he talk to you about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>STABLER: He never really took me to task about the general Arab view that our
                    policy in the Middle East was dictated by domestic considerations. I don't ever
                    remember him talking a great deal about that. He was apt to talk about the
                    larger picture of how he viewed and looked towards the future and some peaceful
                    arrangement where Jordan would be a bigger state and Israel would be there, etc.
                    He obviously very much wanted to have a formal relationship with the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>In January 30, 1949, I went down to the Cable Wireless office, near the central
                    Post Office, where I had to go to pick up my messages—by this time I was alone
                    again, I didn't have any clerk—and found a USINFO message in the clear put out
                    by USIA which declared that the United States had recognized Jordan and Israel
                    de jure. Then there was a coded message. I had to go back to the house and get
                    my one time pad out and laboriously decode the message which said exactly what
                    the message had said that was in the clear. I was to inform the King that Jordan
                    was recognized de jure. Then I had to sit down and type the message out, sign
                    it, get into my car and drive to the Palace, see the King and hand him the note.
                    This was about 11:00 in the morning. He said, “Yes. Where have you been? I have
                    been waiting for you since 8:00 this morning.” It had been on the BBC. Yet, the
                    Department had seen fit to give me no warning or opportunity to have at least
                    the advantage of appearing to be on the inside. It had all been made public-yet
                    I had to go through this business of decoding this stupid message which said all
                    the same things as the public message.</p>
                <p>The King was pleased but I think he would have been more pleased if I had been
                    able to go in the night before and say, “Your Majesty, I just have come to
                    inform you that we are announcing tomorrow morning that we are extending de jure
                    recognition.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went back to Washington afterwards, did you ever
                        find out why this happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I am afraid it is just our system which never really functions terribly
                    well with these things. Part of it comes from the White House which sometimes
                    doesn't tell the State Department when it is going to do something. The State
                    Department is frightened to death of sending any message ahead of the White
                    House. Nobody in the White House stops to think about the other side - that
                    maybe some foreign policy advantage could be gained by doing some of these
                    things in a slightly different way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that I have had some interviews with people
                        who were in the middle of a civil war where we recognized one side or the
                        other in Africa leaving our embassy extremely exposed because they were
                        under the power of the group not accorded the recognition.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think, as a general rule, we have been extremely lacking in using our
                    information sometimes to our best advantage. We don't tell our people in the
                    field sometimes what they ought to know. We don't tell them in a timely enough
                    fashion. We generally view the ambassador as someone who is there but not really
                    considered as a priority matter. The British are much better then this. They
                    consider the ambassador an important person and a priority member of the team.
                    He is told what he has to know in plenty of time. I don't mean to make a capital
                    case of it that our relations with Jordan were forever compromised by that. All
                    I am saying is that it would have been a good gesture to have told the King in
                    advance, but we didn't do it.</p>
                <p>He was pleased and we set up the Legation in Amman. The British Royal Air Force
                    sent an honor guard to the Legation the morning I raised the flag, which was in
                    February, - a month later - because I think it took Washington a month to get
                    all the staff out and formally set up the Legation.</p>
                <p>That year, the Fourth of July, the first one where we had formal relations, the
                    Arab Legion sent a brass band to play at the reception that I gave that
                    afternoon. It was all done with good humor. The King was obviously pleased to
                    have the United States finally a member of the diplomatic corps in Jordan. It
                    didn't change a great deal because I had already worked as a Mission.</p>
                <p>Nothing really spectacular happened during that period. A lot of it was dealing
                    with the question of the future and how to settle the problem with Israel. What
                    to do, etc. Then, internally, the King spent some time trying to decide...I
                    spend a certain amount of time with him. We discussed and debated what we should
                    call Transjordan. It was called the Kingdom of Transjordan and he wanted to
                    change it. The discussion was whether we call it the Hashemite Kingdom of the
                    Jordan, or Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Ultimately it was decided to call it
                    Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. While I was with him we would spend time trying to
                    design a new decoration. Things of that sort. Just sort of amusing household
                    details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it much of the relationship you are talking about.
                        You were there more because of the long term visiting and all as a
                        friend...although there was quite a difference not only obviously in rank
                        but also in age. Do you think he was reaching out to you in some of these
                        ways either as a counter or just a difference than with the British, because
                        the British had been there so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>STABLER: I don't think as a counter force. I think he obviously enjoyed the idea
                    that he had a “special relationship,” if you want to call it that although it
                    really wasn't, with representatives of the great powers. To him the French were
                    not very important and they had all been involved in the business of denying him
                    the Kingdom of Syria; the fourth Republic was a mess and were not to be taken
                    very seriously. Obviously he had nothing to do with the Russians; they weren't
                    there and they were bad. While he had had all these years of close relationship
                    with the British, now suddenly the United States had become a friend too. I am
                    sure that going back to what I mentioned very early on when I first went over to
                    Amman in early 1945, with Pinkerton who had been criticized for not taking an
                    interest in the Emir, and took an interest, and although I was only a vice
                    consul that seemed to appeal to him too and for some reason we struck it off
                    quite well personally. But certainly there was no question that I represented
                    his contact with the other great power. It was never a counterbalance to the
                    British because there was nothing we did. The British provided arms for him,
                    they provided military officers, and trade, etc. And we provided nothing.</p>
                <p>We did, however, recognize that he was a force for stability in that part of the
                    world and that view is still held today. In spite of the fact that King Hussein,
                    for his own good reasons, did what he did at the outset of the Iraqi invasion of
                    Kuwait, he remains an asset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put this in context, we are talking about just after
                        what was called the Gulf War between the United States and its Allies and
                        Iraq in which Jordan and King Hussein were at least verbally giving a great
                        deal of support to the Iraqi side which was not appreciated by the United
                        States at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: One has to remember that King Hussein has a great many Palestinians in
                    his Kingdom and at that time Saddam Hussein was trying to use the Palestine ploy
                    to garner support and Hussein has to be somewhat a survivor. The fact is that
                    Jordan does represent an element of basic stability and we are not just about to
                    abandon them, and certainly in the period I am talking about, 1948, Jordan was
                    the only country that showed at least some degree of sensitivity and rationality
                    when it came to Israel.</p>
                <p>During that period I saw a lot of the King. He gave me a horse that I used to
                    ride. I used to play polo in Amman with Arab Legion officers which was fun but
                    dangerous. One had really an interesting time with not only the Jordanians and
                    Palestinians but with the foreign community. It was a very small town. Everybody
                    knew what everybody else was doing. There was a lot of intrigue and things of
                    that sort. But it was a wonderful experience. King Abdullah was really a very
                    nice person and I was very fond of him.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I remember one episode when I thought my career might come to an abrupt end.
                    While I was in Amman, I had with me my small dachshund. One evening I went up to
                    see Abdullah and left the dog in the car (which I drove, not having a driver),
                    with one window slightly open - I thought. As I sat with the King, I heard a
                    yelping and was horrified to see my dachshund, which had escaped from my car,
                    chasing the King's cat through the room where we sat. Fortunately, the cat
                    escaped, and every time I saw Abdullah after that, he inquired as to the welfare
                    of my dachshund. It might have been disastrous.</p>
                <p>I was amused at one point when Stanton Griffis, US Ambassador in Cairo, came over
                    to Amman. I showed him around and took him down to the Winter Quarters in Shuneh
                    to have dinner with the King. He was quite taken with all this performance and
                    apparently wrote to Bob Lovett who was then the Under Secretary of State,
                    recommending that I be made the first US Minister to Jordan. Well, I was only 28
                    or 29. That fell, as you can imagine, not only on deaf but scandalized ears in
                    Washington...the idea that someone at the lowest grade in the Foreign Service
                    should suddenly become a Minister. Of course some of my colleagues in the Middle
                    East like Keeley, who was US Minister in Damascus, didn't think it was a very
                    good idea either. Anyway, it didn't get very far. So I became the first Charg�
                    d'Affaires in Amman and then in August, 1949 I was transferred. David Fritzlan
                    came out as the Charg� d'Affaires.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have done an interview with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: You have done an interview with David?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Then, as you know, the Minister was selected, a man by the name of
                    Maynard Barnes, I think it was. He suddenly disappeared from sight and didn't
                    go. The first US Minister was Gerald Drew who came out in early 1950.</p>
                <p>I came back to Washington in the usual performance. I was told to return to
                    Washington without delay, the fastest possible means. I rushed back, rushed to
                    the Department to the greeting, “Oh, you are here? Why did you come back so
                    fast?” No one then knew why I had been told to come back so fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I worked on Palestine Affairs for a while. Then in January, 1950 became Political
                    Advisor to the US Representative to the UN Trusteeship Council (Francis Sayre
                    who had been at one time Governor of the Philippines). The Council met in Geneva
                    from January, 1950 through the middle/end of March, 1950, to draft the statute
                    for the international city of Jerusalem—the Corpus Separatum. This was an
                    interesting three months of activity where the Trustee Council very seriously
                    went through step by step, chapter by chapter, setting up the regime for the
                    international city of Jerusalem and for the Holy Places in what had been
                    Palestine, so that Bethlehem, Nazareth, etc. would be under the control of the
                    administrator of this international city with an international police force.</p>
                <p>That was pursuant to the Partition Resolution in 1947. At the end of the session,
                    the plan was given to the representative of Israel and the representative of
                    Jordan, which then controlled the Holy Places in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
                    Within a matter of a very few minutes those representatives, on instructions
                    from their governments, turned the whole project down. And that was the end of
                    that.</p>
                <p>I then returned to Washington and became the officer in charge of Egyptian and
                    Anglo-Egyptian Sudan affairs. That was in the middle of 1950. I remained there
                    until I went to Rome in 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume when you came back you must have, having been at
                        the far end connected by a one-time pad and all...I have the impression from
                        the way you have been talking and referring to things, that Secretary of
                        State Acheson, of course very busy with the Marshall Plan and all, that our
                        Middle East policy, what there was of it, was being pretty well called by
                        the White House and dictated more by going after the Jewish vote. Did you
                        have that feeling, or was there really more to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think during the period in which I was in Jordan, the policy was
                    probably largely determined by the White House. We talked about the recognition
                    of Israel and the eventual recognition de jure of Jordan. I think one has always
                    understood that there was a certain resentment in the White House towards people
                    in the State Department who were considered to be Arabists and who regarded our
                    Israeli policy as being seriously, if not fatally, flawed in terms of the over
                    all future of our relations with the Arabs. But when I got back in 1959, I guess
                    by then Acheson had taken over as Secretary of State. George McGhee had become
                    Assistant Secretary for the Near East and Southeast Asian Affairs. George had
                    visited me in Amman and we had become friends. On his return to Washington he
                    began his stint as Assistant Secretary. In one of the books he wrote much later,
                    he mentioned his meeting with Abdullah, and my role in Jordan, etc. We were, of
                    course, very much aware of the domestic political considerations affecting our
                    Middle East policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>When I got into Egyptian Affairs, at the beginning there was no particular
                    high-level interest in what went on in Egypt. The Arabs were still being
                    difficult about Israel, but there wasn't a fighting war. Egypt only became a
                    matter of serious consideration when the British began having increasing
                    troubles with the Egyptians over the maintenance of their military bases. By the
                    same token we were having the trouble in Iran with Mossadegh and all of that. It
                    was only at this particular point that Dean Acheson became intimately involved
                    in these two questions, both Iran and Egypt. I had the greatest admiration for
                    Acheson and I always regarded it as a great privilege to work closely with him,
                    which I did for a year plus or so,</p>
                <p>We tried to think of ways that we could have some cover organization to make
                    possible the maintenance and continuance of British bases in Egypt. The Director
                    of Near Eastern Affairs was Lewis Jones, who is now dead, who was an imaginative
                    sort of fellow. He came up with the idea of what was called MEDO, the Middle
                    East Defense Organization which would go from Turkey through to Egypt. It would
                    act as an umbrella to which various countries could belong, so that it wouldn't
                    appear that Egypt was being occupied, if you will, by British forces. It would
                    be a sort of NATO for that part of the world. It was an idea which simply
                    wouldn't fly because the Egyptians at that point were getting very nationalist
                    and wanted the end of British influence and British military bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, of course, part of the pull out of the Suez
                        Canal.....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, that was 1956. I am talking about 1951-2 when there was a lot of
                    national pressures. The people were getting disenchanted with Farouk. He was
                    getting more difficult for the British and ourselves to deal with because he was
                    recognizing some of this pressure.</p>
                <p>We would give the British lots of free advice on what they might or might not do.
                    They didn't particularly care for this. One of the areas where it would seem
                    possible for some compromise was the Sudan, which was a condominium called the
                    Anglo/Egyptian Sudan. While the governor of the Sudan was British and all the
                    best administrators were British, there was a small Egyptian presence and
                    Farouk, technically speaking, was King of the Sudan, although he shared that
                    sovereignty with the British.</p>
                <p>It was argued at one point that if somehow one could recognize Farouk's full
                    sovereignty as King of the Sudan that would give him something which would
                    permit him to diminish Egyptian insistence that the British close their bases.
                    Ultimately it was decided in Washington...one of the difficulties was that we
                    didn't have any representation in the Sudan, so I was instructed to go and visit
                    the Sudan and come back and make a report to the Secretary as to what I thought
                    should be done. The idea behind this still being that somehow the recognition of
                    Farouk's sovereignty would be helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>By this time Dean Acheson was taking an increasing interest in all this. In early
                    January 1952 I was attending a meeting in Secretary Acheson's office with
                    Anthony Eden, British Foreign Secretary, discussing the Egyptian question and
                    Eden was complaining that we were constantly giving the British advice on Egypt
                    and the Sudan but no one from Washington had ever been to the Sudan, so how did
                    we know what we were saying. Secretary Acheson was able to say, “Well, Anthony,
                    I can tell you that Stabler is leaving, actually tonight, for the Sudan.” Which
                    indeed I was.</p>
                <p>I went down there and had three very interesting weeks of visiting all parts of
                    the Sudan, part of the time with the Counselor of our Embassy in Cairo, Gordon
                    Mattison. He was with me part of the time and then he went back and I stayed on.
                    On the way back to Washington by plane I wrote a report in which I in effect
                    said that the Sudanese were not really interested in having the British continue
                    in the Sudan and certainly weren't interested in having the Egyptians there
                    either. Ultimately what they wanted was independence. I was interested in the
                    fact that it was almost exactly a year later that was exactly what they got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went there, the British had their Sudanese
                        service running things, which had the reputation of being the best of all
                        the British colonial services. How did you get around? How did you find out
                        that you could come and say that the Sudanese feel this or that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Obviously one was the guest of the British. I stayed with the Civil
                    Secretary, John Willy Robertson, who later became Governor of Nigeria. I also
                    stayed with Sir Robert Howe, who was the Governor. I stayed in various places
                    with British district officers and governors of provinces. I nonetheless had
                    free rein to see people I wanted to see. That meant the Sudanese political
                    leaders in Khartoum and in other parts of the Sudan that I visited. I went down
                    west, up north, and to the southern part, which is in such contention today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the difference between Black and Arab.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>STABLER: It was the difference between Moslem and Pagan. I would go out into the
                    bush. Once I spent the night in a little place called Turit which was in the
                    Latuka tribe area, and spoke with many of Latuka tribe. I talked to a lot of
                    people, lots of Sudanese. There was simply no doubt in my mind that independence
                    was what they wanted. You can't talk to everybody but you can form impressions,
                    and if you have had any sort of training, background of this kind of thing, you
                    get a feel. One could be wrong, but that was my very distinct feeling. I was
                    amused last year when some professor of political science at the University of
                    Texas called me up to make a lunch engagement because he had just gotten through
                    the Freedom for Information Act the report I had written on the Sudan. He is
                    writing a book, or something, on British policies in the Middle East. My report
                    was in February/March 1952, and it was just about a year later that it was
                    decided to hold a UN-sponsored referendum in 1954 in the Sudan. This then led to
                    their independence shortly thereafter, on January 1, 1956.</p>
                <p>I also recommended that we set up an office in Khartoum because of the situation
                    in the Sudan. I think only the French were allowed to have a consulate there
                    because of French Equatorial Africa, therefore we couldn't do that. So I
                    suggested that we set up a liaison office. We did and, if I remember correctly,
                    my friend William Burdett who I mentioned before, was the first officer there.
                    This occurred before the British left. Ultimately that led to setting up a US
                    Legation or Embassy.</p>
                <p>The upshot of all this was that we were never able to come up with a particular
                    solution to the Egyptian question. The British then decided to go. I went to
                    talk to the British Commander-in-Chief at his base on the Suez Canal and I think
                    the writing was on the wall. They recognized it. And then, of course, in July,
                    1952, Farouk was forced to abdicate by the Colonels.</p>
                <p>I went over to Cairo shortly thereafter and was the first foreign diplomat to
                    talk to Naguib, who was then the front man for the Colonels, down in Alexandria
                    where he was. Caffery was the Ambassador at that time.</p>
                <p>But throughout that period, Acheson maintained a very close interest in all of
                    this. I traveled with him a number of times. One was at the time of the
                    contractuals in Germany which was sometime in 1952. Then we had a meeting with
                    Eden again in the British Embassy in Paris, again discussing all these
                    particular questions. I had many meetings with British officials in London in
                    connection with these various trips and things that I had done.</p>
                <p>Then, in the latter part of 1952, I was called into the office of one of the
                    Deputy Assistant Secretaries for Near Eastern Affairs, Burton Berry, who I
                    believe is now dead. He asked me if I would like to have a break from Middle
                    East affairs for a couple of years and go to the embassy in Rome. I said I
                    would.</p>

                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me go back to cover this Sudan/Egyptian thing. When
                        you arrived, what was your impression of how we viewed the Egyptians, Farouk
                        situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: When I first got back I think the general feeling was that Farouk was a
                    total disaster. He had allowed himself to go to pieces and lose control of
                    things. It wasn't until 1952...remember in 1952, when I was in the Sudan, there
                    were the riots in Cairo—sort of anti-government riots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when they burned down Shepherd's Hotel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: It was a total mess. I had to go back from Khartoum to Cairo, but I did
                    it the long way, in part because I think I am a coward when it comes to flying
                    and I did not want to fly with the Egyptian airline, AirMisr, or more often
                    called Air Misery. I flew via Tripoli where I had a nice lunch with my friend,
                    Sir Alec Kirkbride, who was the British Ambassador, and then had to fly from
                    Tripoli to Athens and from Athens down to Cairo.</p>
                <p>These riots troubled a great many people, Farouk included. Caffery took the view
                    that all was not lost if we could take Farouk in hand and get him really to pay
                    attention to what was happening. He had the power. He wasn't just a
                    constitutional monarch, but he was a playboy. Lots of people talked to him about
                    taking charge, including the British.</p>
                <p>We did something at that time which was really quite unusual. It was felt in
                    Washington and in London that we needed an assessment of what was happening in
                    Egypt...what people on the spot thought would be the future, politically. The
                    Foreign Office and the State Department instructed the American and British
                    Ambassadors, Jefferson Caffery, and I think Ray Stevenson was the British
                    Ambassador, to undertake a joint assessment. They prepared a joint assessment,
                    which was signed by both of them, and sent to London and Washington. Part of
                    assessment was that if they could get Farouk in hand and provide him with good
                    personal security apparatus and some good advice maybe he would be able to pull
                    this thing back into shape. We did.</p>
                <p>CIA was very active at that time and I am sure the British services were too. We
                    tried to train a small security group for him and sort of prop him up a bit with
                    the idea that if he really could gain an active interest again in what was
                    happening in his country some good would come out of it.</p>
                <p>But it was already too late because this was January 1952 and by July he was out.
                    One anecdote about his departure which I think is interesting. Farouk was down
                    in Alexandria and there was a great deal of discussion among the revolutionary
                    command council as to what to do with him. A young man by the name of Bill
                    Lakeland who was political officer in the Embassy had become conduit for
                    messages between Caffery...</p>

                <p>STABLER: Very much so and a good one. He had his own idiosyncrasies and so forth,
                    but he was imperial and the Ambassador didn't plunge into the business of
                    contact with little colonels, etc. So Bill Lakeland was the conduit. Caffery in
                    effect said to them, “Look, you will do yourself irrevocable harm
                    internationally if you murder Farouk or put him on trial. There is no reason to
                    do that, there is nothing he can do, let him go.” They agreed so his yacht
                    appeared on the scene. But shortly before this Farouk decided that it was rather
                    dangerous to go to his yacht and he sent word through Caffery, and Caffery felt
                    he had no choice but to transmit it, a request for a US warship to take Farouk
                    off.</p>
                <p>The message came into me. I decided that, although I knew the answer, I couldn't
                    take the responsibility on my own and went to see Hank Byroade, who was my
                    Assistant Secretary at the time. He knew what the answer was but he decided he
                    couldn't take the decision on his own, so he and I went up to Acheson's office.
                    Acheson thought this was a matter relating to a head of state and he couldn't
                    make that decision, so he picked up the phone and called Truman. He said, “Mr.
                    President we have a situation here and my recommendation is that we shouldn't do
                    it, but I want you to make the decision.” Truman, in fairly strong language,
                    allowed as how that in no way would he send a warship to take Farouk off.</p>
                <p>Farouk went off in his yacht. Caffery went down to see him off. Apparently there
                    was not a very high Egyptian functionary there to see him off. Caffery let the
                    Colonels know that their whole behavior had not done them any credit. Then, as
                    you may remember, Farouk apparently loaded his yacht with some gold bullion,
                    which the new regime discovered. They sent some planes out to try to bomb the
                    yacht but they didn't find it and Farouk made it to Italy.</p>
                <p>It was in Italy when he came to see me one night to talk about the Palestine
                    fiasco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting back in Washington about the new
                        colonels. This became sort of the prime example of every time there was a
                        coup thereafter we tried to figure out whose behind it. They were Lt.
                        Colonels weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, indeed. There were some majors too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was some majors who were really running the show.
                        Nasser suddenly appeared. From that time on this is a set piece, “Well, who
                        is really doing this?” But at that time this is brand new for us. How did we
                        look at this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think that at that time there wasn't any question in people's minds
                    that Naguib was the front man. He was an older General and had been put in
                    because...you remember they did not rid the country of the monarchy right away.
                    Immediately Abdel Moneim who was, I think, an uncle of Farouk became the Regent
                    and Aly Maher became the Prime Minister. Shortly after that they got rid of Aly
                    Maher and Naguib was brought in. I think the Embassy was fully aware at that
                    time that it was not Naguib but these colonels and majors who were running the
                    show. It was with them that most of the negotiations and contacts were done,
                    although we had to keep in touch with Naguib too.</p>
                <p>One of the great problems was that they wanted to have arms and military
                    equipment. The equipment that the Egyptian army had was not very high grade and
                    they wanted very much to re-equip the army in an effort to erase the stain on
                    the country from the miserable performance of the Palestine War. It was felt
                    that probably one ought to do something of this sort in order to establish a
                    bond between the United States and this new Egypt. But we, in terms of the
                    grants that we made and in some instances sales and others, but principally
                    grants to begin with...we of course always demanded that they sign all sorts of
                    binding agreements about not using any weapons without consulting with us. A lot
                    of us felt that that was a mistake at the time because it sort of limited their
                    sovereignty and made it appear that we didn't trust them. The law was the law
                    and we had our hands tied sometimes quite needlessly. That fell through. That
                    created tensions with the Nasser and the Colonels right from the very
                    beginning.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter I left the Egyptian scene and went to Rome. But one saw the
                    effects of this as time went on. It got worse and worse with Nasser - we know
                    about that. But the feeling of a lot of us at the time when I was still working
                    on this was that it was necessary to show some form of trust and collaboration
                    which would make this group, which was suspicious of the United States role with
                    Israel, but would make this group look to us as their friend, as they no longer
                    looked to the British that way. One wanted to keep other busybodies out of the
                    area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the point the Soviets weren't particularly

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, they weren't at all. They played virtually no role in the Middle
                    East, but people were beginning to think in terms of: We want nothing to do with
                    the British or the French; the United States is our friend but if they are not
                    our friend, we have to have a friend. That, I think, was the beginning, that
                    very episode of this agreement which they wouldn't sign, of their beginning to
                    think in terms of perhaps looking in the direction of the Soviet Union.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>STABLER: No, I had left in early 1953. There had been the inauguration of
                    Eisenhower and Dulles had become Secretary. I was in Rome just at the beginning
                    of the Dulles regime in the Department, although I came back to Washington in
                    1957 with Dulles still there and much to my irritation and annoyance found
                    myself right back on the Egyptian Desk once more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought we might call it off at this point. We will
                        start the next time with your time in Rome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April, 5, 1991. This is a further interview with
                        Ambassador Wells Stabler. Mr. Ambassador, we are going to your time when you
                        went to Rome—1953-7. Could you say how you got the job of going to Rome and
                        what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I had been in Near Eastern Affairs for quite a few years—1944-53.
                    Sometime in the fall of 1952 I was called in by the then Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, Burton Berry, who asked if I would be
                    interested in an assignment to Rome—sort of a long service and good conduct
                    award for the years that I had been in the Middle East. I think they offered it
                    to me with the idea that I would be in Rome for three to four years and then
                    return to the Near East. But that was never stated. So this came right out of
                    the blue. I was surprised and very pleased. I had visited Rome for the first
                    time on the way back from Jerusalem in January 1947 and thought that it would be
                    a wonderful place to be.</p>
                <p>So, obviously, I accepted with enthusiasm and set off in February, 1953 via
                    Madrid and then by train to Rome. At the time I arrived there, Ellsworth Bunker
                    was the Ambassador. He had been there only for about a year. He had come, if I
                    recall correctly, from Argentina. But then there was a change of
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be the change to the Eisenhower
                        Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Eisenhower became President and Dulles, Secretary of State. One of the
                    early appointments of General Eisenhower was Clare Boothe Luce as Ambassador to
                    Italy. So very shortly after I arrived in the middle of February, I was with
                    Bunker only for possibly a month, Mrs. Luce appeared on the scene early in the
                    Spring of 1953.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived we had in the Political Section the Political Counselor,
                    Francis Williamson, who was not actually a Foreign Service Officer. He had
                    served in the Department, I believe in German Affairs, and had then been sent to
                    Rome as a Foreign Service Reserve Officer. I was very fond of Francis. He had
                    some of the drawbacks of someone who has never served abroad in such a capacity
                    and who did not speak Italian. I think he had some problems adjusting to the
                    requirements of the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you spell that out a little more, what you
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: What I mean was that most Political Counselors have come up through the
                    ranks and have served in a variety of capacities—consular, economic,
                    administrative, junior political officers, etc.—developing the background of how
                    to run a section; what a political section should do; and the role of the
                    political counselor in establishing important contacts with the political
                    leaders, shakers of activity, in the country and also, obviously, with their
                    colleagues in foreign embassies. I think Francis was fine when it came to
                    establishing contacts with foreign embassies, but he didn't speak Italian and
                    was not terribly comfortable in trying to establish contact with some of the
                    Italian politicians. Obviously his inability to speak the language was a
                    considerable drawback to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that the Italians are on par with the French
                        as far as not learning other languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, that is true. The Italian political leaders that I knew, as well as
                    the rank and file, seldom spoke English. To be effective in the Italian scene
                    you simply had to know the language because, as we all know, you lose a lot in
                    translation. It wasn't Francis' fault. He was given this assignment and was
                    happy to have it. But I think he was not really up to the task and I think this
                    took a toll on him physically. He eventually became quite ill and was
                    transferred. Then we had a career political counselor, Niles Bond.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived in terms of the Political Section, Francis really hadn't
                    thought out what it was I should be doing. That made it very awkward. I was
                    Second Secretary and way down the line, but I did speak some Italian before I
                    came and in a relatively short time became relatively fluent in it. I did some
                    things for the Ambassador, but there was no structure so far as to the role I
                    was going to fill.</p>
                <p>In due course, it is one of these things that happens, I began cutting out a
                    niche that I thought would be interesting and useful and started covering in the
                    internal political section some of the political parties—center parties, right
                    wing party, etc. We didn't have anything to do with the MSI, (Movimento
                    Socialista Italiano), which was the Fascist Party. I also worked with some of
                    the Christian Democrats. So in time I sort of really developed these contacts on
                    my own and reported on these parties.</p>
                <p>As time went on I became more and more involved in the internal political side of
                    things. We had one man who did the Communists. In those days the Socialists were
                    considered to be an ally of the Communists. We referred to the extreme left as
                    Social/Communists, they were lumped together. He covered them, although we had
                    no contacts with the Communist Party nor the Socialist Party at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling within the section about no contact?
                        This meant that at least a third of the populous of Italy was off limits, so
                        to speak.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: At that particular time, a time not so terribly long after the war and
                    where the Communists had gained a considerable amount of ground, we, the United
                    States, had put in a great deal of effort and money into trying to build up the
                    democratic element in Italy, which meant the Christian Democratic Party and the
                    three small so-called lay parties, the Liberals, the Republicans and the Social
                    Democrats. The Christian Democratic Party was the largest party in Italy but
                    constantly under attack by this increasing success of the Communists. The
                    Socialists were relatively small, perhaps 13 or 14 percent of the vote, and the
                    Communists were beginning to go on up into the high 20s and eventually got into
                    the low 30s.</p>
                <p>The attack on this democratic element in Italy was a fairly great one and
                    supported, of course, by the Soviet Union and by the Eastern European Soviet
                    Bloc. Great effort was expended, for example, in bolstering the democratic trade
                    union confederation, the so-called CISL. The effort to block the left trade
                    union confederation, CGIL, in the progress they were making in taking over the
                    various labor unions and shop stewards in the factories was a major item.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say efforts on the part of the United States,
                        what does this mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, it meant in many instances, financial support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this from us or through the AFL-CIO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, it was done partly through them, sometimes more directly through
                    CIA. This is now history and a lot has been written about what was done at that
                    time. Tom Lane, who was the Labor Attach� at that time, was very instrumental in
                    carrying out this program, one in which Mrs. Luce took a very great interest.
                    One of the methods of dealing with this problem was through tour Offshore
                    Procurements program, which was a very large item at that time. It was made a
                    condition for certain factories that in order to get Offshore Procurement
                    contracts their union elections had to vote in the democratic trade unions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does Offshore Procurements mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>STABLER: NATO had been set up and components of required military hardware were
                    manufactured in some of the NATO countries. So we would put out contracts for
                    the manufactured delivery of certain components from factories in Italy. But in
                    order to obtain that contract, there had to be clear indications that the trade
                    union situation in that factory was a democratic one. If it was heavily CGIL,
                    then no Offshore Procurement. And those Offshore Procurement contracts produced
                    sizable sums of money for Italian industry, which was recovering of course from
                    the blows of the war. There was a lot of hard ball played over this as it was
                    felt that this was a major element in the campaign to try to block the
                    Communists. It was fairly successful. There was no question that these
                    industrialists clearly saw dollar signs which was important and they did what
                    they could to try to build up the labor in their plants coming from the
                    democratic side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put this in contact, in a later period the Communist
                        movement in Italy was seen as sort of a national communist, an almost benign
                        movement. How did we feel about it within the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: This wasn't the case then, because this was full-blown cold war where it
                    was generally believed that the support that Communists/Socialists had came
                    directly from the Soviet Union or one of the Eastern European countries. So this
                    was really another front, basically, in the Cold War with the Soviet Union at
                    that time. It wasn't until later...one of the first indications of a break in
                    the picture came early in 1956 with the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian
                    uprising. The Italian Communists took a position against what the Soviet Union
                    had done. This put the Italian Communists for the first time in a dilemma:
                    whether to simply blindly support everything the Soviets did, or to indicate
                    that they had a somewhat more independent view about some of these things. Since
                    the Soviet action in Hungary was immensely unpopular, it wasn't, perhaps, too
                    difficult for the Communists in Italy to indicate that they too disapproved of
                    it.</p>
                <p>Of course, as we recall, one of the great difficulties at that time was that the
                    universal disapproval of what the Soviets had done in Hungary was somewhat
                    tempered by the considerable disapproval of what the British and the French did
                    in Suez.</p>
                <p>In any event, the Embassy considered - Mrs. Luce was very strongly
                    anti-communist, as indeed was Dulles, and so any indication of an Embassy
                    contact with a communist would have flown directly in the face of the policy we
                    were carrying out at that time. So I think that everybody agreed that that
                    probably would have been a mistake to start any contacts with the communists at
                    that time. They developed later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about after 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>STABLER: It seems to me...I'm a little vague now on dates...I don't think
                    anything was done immediately after 1956. I think it was considerably later that
                    the first contacts took place. I can't remember now exactly when, but I don't
                    think it was until into the 60s. Because even after '56, although it was a
                    political gesture to disapprove of what the Soviets had done in Hungary, they
                    rapidly returned pretty much to being what they had always been and continued to
                    grow in strength amongst the electorate. Partly when it came to regional, local
                    elections, where they always did well. That came from the fact that in a
                    predominately Catholic country, the Vatican was extremely active in opposing the
                    Communists at election time...their would be homilies from the pulpit urging the
                    faithful not to vote for the Communists. This unquestioningly had some effect in
                    blocking the continuing rise of the Communist Party in last elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said as a political officer you carved out your own
                        bailiwick of the center parties. What were you after, and how did you
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: One was trying to first of all...when it came to the Christian
                    Democratic Party obviously since they formed the government and when they had
                    the absolute majority, which they did have when I first arrived - De Gasperi was
                    still Prime Minister - of course, they held all the portfolios. The Ambassador
                    and the DCM has the contacts, obviously, with that level and one tried to
                    establish contacts at my level with some of the deputies who were important in
                    Parliament and really to try to find out what they were thinking, how they
                    viewed the development of the political situation. Let me say that at that time
                    also, there was a fairly active program in support of the Christian Democrats.
                    So the principal players were people who were known to the more senior people at
                    the Embassy.</p>
                <p>But there were the other parties, the lay parties and at that time the Monarchist
                    party had some strength which ultimately had views to express. So that was a
                    party that I was also in touch with, but with absolutely no expectation of being
                    part of the government but had a certain number of deputies in parliament and
                    one wanted to encourage them to support the democratic process. I had vague
                    contacts with the Fascist part of the MSI, they also sat in parliament, they
                    were a legal party. We felt that it was a mistake to cut them off totally
                    although we didn't approve of their politics. But by having at least a point of
                    contact, one was able then to bring forth directly to them the American point of
                    view on things. It was one of those things that was really neither particularly
                    a plus nor particularly a minus. The contacts were very limited.</p>
                <p>When it became clear that the Monarchists were not going to go anywhere, that
                    became less important and the contacts with the lay parties with Christian
                    Democratic deputies were the principal focus of my activity.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I had some rather interesting developments. One of them related to the President
                    of Italy, then Giovanni Gronchi - he was elected to the Presidency I would guess
                    in 1956 - he was regarded as a left wing Christian Democrat and was seen by many
                    in the US Government, including some in the Rome Embassy as being somewhat
                    perilously close to the left and perhaps not overly friendly to the United
                    States. But in the complex picture of Italian politics, there was a constant
                    sort of balancing of forces, right wing one time, center, left wing. It was
                    something that was necessary for the internal workings and harmony of the
                    Christian Democratic Party. Gronchi who had been President of the Chamber at the
                    time, was clearly in that rank where he could become President. He was
                    eventually elected and the Embassy, Mrs. Luce on down, was not very happy about
                    it.</p>
                <p>In any event, it was decided to ask him to come to the United States on a State
                    Visit in the hopes that by paying some attention to him we would have him as a
                    player in terms of how we felt political development should go in Italy. I had
                    received a letter from a colleague in the Embassy in Caracas some time before
                    all this mentioning that a good friend of theirs who was in the Papal Nunciatura
                    in Caracas, Monsignor Mariani was returning to the Secretariat of State in the
                    Vatican and we might find it useful to establish some contact with him, which I
                    did. We became quite friendly. I saw him from time to time, he was in the
                    Secretariat of State and seemed to be remarkably well connected, although he was
                    not a particularly senior member of the Secretariat of State. At one stage
                    before the visit of President Gronchi to the United States, Mariani got in touch
                    with me and asked if it would be of interest to me to meet with the President of
                    Italy. Well, this was rather a strange situation because I was still a Second
                    Secretary and was not Political Counselor. But it seemed to me that there was
                    some indications that the President of Italy wanted to meet with someone at the
                    Embassy but did not want to meet with any of the senior people because it would
                    attract attention. So I decided that even though it was rather unusual—Mrs. Luce
                    was not in the country, I think she had gone home, Jack Jernegan was then the
                    DCM—without complicating things too much I would just go ahead and do it. I
                    guess that by this time it had clearly been conveyed to me that President
                    Gronchi would like to have it work out this way.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I met Monsignor Mariani and we were taken to the Quirinale, the Presidential
                    Palace, to a private part of it where the President lived but which was not in
                    the public eye. I had about two hours with the President. It was rather unusual.
                    There was the President, myself and then this Monsignor Mariani. In this
                    conversation, I must say Gronchi opened himself rather fully as to his political
                    views and was very much aware of the American suspicions and doubts. He was
                    really quite persuasive in what he had to say. When this was over I went back to
                    the Embassy and went to see Jack Jernegan who at that point was in his apartment
                    at 21 Via Pinciana, but in bed with the flu. So I went by to see him and
                    explained to him what had happened and how it had happened and that I felt I
                    really had no choice in the circumstances but just to go ahead and do it. I gave
                    him my full report and this went in to Washington and formed one of the
                    principal papers for the Gronchi visit. I will say in full regard for my bosses
                    in Rome, they were very understanding of what had happened. They could have been
                    really quite annoyed that a Second Secretary had been received by the President.
                    But it was a chance I took, a chance, I think, that paid off in terms of getting
                    the first indication of Gronchi's thinking as he described it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you felt that he was going through you because this
                        was a quieter channel to get this in rather than to be talking to somebody
                        who would leave him more open for showing a change in policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: The Ambassador would have obviously attracted attention if she had gone
                    and then it would have been much more formal. The Minister, Jack Jernegan didn't
                    speak Italian. The Political Counselor at that time may have been Niles Bond,
                    but I am not sure. It was known in Italian political circles that I spoke
                    Italian and therefore the decision apparently was made...you know the way these
                    things are done it is quite possible that Mariani told Gronchi that I wanted to
                    see him and then told me that Gronchi wanted to see me. But however it came out,
                    it worked out, I think, pretty well. I think it did go a long way to reassure
                    people. It ultimately turned out to be the case too, that Gronchi during the
                    years that he was President, never really did anything which was inimical to the
                    interests of the United States.</p>
                <p>During the years that I was in Rome, which was 1953-57, my role obviously as time
                    went on became increasingly active in the political field. I was never number
                    two in the section, but I ran the internal political unit and became rather
                    closely identified with the development of political thinking in Italy, that is
                    to say the reporting of political thinking in Italy. I did a lot of work with
                    Mrs. Luce. When she had political leaders to lunch I very often was invited
                    because I knew them and I could help in interpreting. I was included in most of
                    the big meals and receptions given by the Ambassador that concerned the
                    political side of life.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I found it all very interesting because Italian politics, although at time
                    frustrating, have a sort of dynamism of their own. One was very much aware of
                    the fact that although they were...well, during the time I was there I don't
                    remember how many now...but many changes of government. But the background music
                    was really basically always the same. They changed the players, musical chairs,
                    but as Italians would often point out, “We may have changed our government many,
                    many times, but frequently the Foreign Minister is the same. We probably have
                    had fewer Foreign Ministers than you have had Secretaries of State over a
                    comparable period of time. There were some players that just shuffled around.
                    The present Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti became a friend of mine in
                    the 1953-57 period and remained a friend. Of course, when I went back as
                    Minister in 1969, a lot of these people I already knew. So the many changes in
                    what the Italians call “i giuocchi politici” - the political games, really
                    concerned the political class. The people of Italy didn't really care much about
                    all this. They paid very little attention to it. Life went on, the economy
                    boomed and the standard of living greatly increased. As long as these political
                    games didn't interfere with this, fine. So the difficulty, of course, was that
                    in the democratic setup, the Christian Democrats had the biggest block of votes.
                    If they lost their absolute majority this would mean that they would have to
                    depend on the three smaller parties to provide the majority and as the smaller
                    parties were really awfully small, the majority was pretty thin. But the policy
                    to support - the American policy, to support what was called the Quadripartito
                    which was a four party arrangement - Christian Democrats, Liberal, Republicans
                    and the Social Democrats - we helped those four parties considerably in an
                    effort to maintain stability in Italy because the Quadripartito could not draw
                    from the right—the Monarchists and MSI—nor from the left—because the Socialist
                    Party had not yet begun developing a more independent view and were pretty much
                    in the pocket of the Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did people in the Embassy feel about the changes in
                        government? It seemed the Embassy people got so involved in the Italian game
                        of politics—constant shifting of the same players—which in many ways had
                        almost no pertinence due to the stability of their outlook towards things.
                        Did you feel that sometimes you were getting sucked into this vortex?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: To some extent. But mind you, the time I am speaking of there really was
                    a major threat from the Social/Communists who occupied a pretty large space in
                    the political spectrum. The Soviets were spending much treasure in trying to
                    subvert Italy and bring them totally into their orbit. That would have been an
                    additional plum for them to have a communist majority and government in
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the same context, there was exactly the same problem,
                        which remained much longer in France.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>STABLER: That's true, though that was somewhat less of a threat because the
                    communists never had quite as large a share of the electorate as they did in
                    Italy, as I recall. When I was in Paris later on, 1960...de Gaulle had just
                    taken over and so the situation shifted rather radically. It is true that a lot
                    of these political games that the Italian played were frustrating, annoying, and
                    it seemed that a lot of it was counterproductive. By the same token that was
                    what was going on and therefore we had to stay on top of it and see to it that
                    Washington was kept fully informed as to what actually was happening in the
                    political body. The principal theme we were focusing on was to make sure that
                    the democratic parties remained in control and that the Communists were blocked.
                    ..........to try to persuade the Italian politicians not to be quite so fickle
                    when it came to all these crises, many of which were totally unnecessary. We
                    were afraid that the electorate would tire of the endless games and look to the
                    Communists to form a more stable and efficient government situation. One thing
                    that was quite true and was constantly a concern to us was that those major
                    cities, and even some of the small ones, where Social/Communists had the
                    majority, were usually very well run. Florence, was one; Bologna was
                    another.</p>
                <p>The mayor of Naples was a monarchist...</p>

                    Party. But it is true that in the cities where the Communists and Socialists
                    together had a majority they were pretty well run.</p>
                <p>At that particular time, 1957, things were still sufficiently uncertain that we
                    had to work hard to keep the democratic center on a stable course.</p>
                <p>One other amusing thing, and again somewhat anecdotal - Mrs. Luce left at the end
                    of 1956 and James David Zellerbach arrived as the new Ambassador. He had
                    previously been in Rome immediately after the war as the AID Director. Around
                    January of 1957 we had the announced visit of the then Vice President and Mrs.
                    Nixon. The drill was that the Political Counselor was to go from the place that
                    he was about to visit to the place that he was then visiting and accompany him
                    on the flight to the place he was going to visit. The Political Counselor at
                    that time had apparently experienced Nixon in Korea and absolutely refused to go
                    to Tripoli to meet Nixon. Although I was number three in the section, the number
                    two dealt with foreign matters rather than the domestic area. So I was then
                    instructed to proceed to Tripoli to pick up the Vice President and come back
                    with him. I found it an interesting thing to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>We flew back and I took Nixon around in Rome, with the Ambassador, of course, but
                    I went as an interpreter, to meet various functionaries of the Italian
                    government including at that time the President of the Chamber of Deputies,
                    Giovanni Leone. That night there was a big dinner at the Ambassador's Residence
                    to which my wife and I were invited.. Before dinner a picture was taken of me
                    with Nixon and Leone. I sort of put that picture away. But shortly after I came
                    back to Rome as Minister in 1969, Leone became President of Italy and Nixon was
                    President of the United States. My picture then came out and was displayed in my
                    residence in Rome. But you can well imagine that once Nixon was forced to resign
                    for reasons we know, and subsequent to that Leone was forced to resign for
                    corruption, the picture was put away again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression on briefing Nixon? Did you have
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No. Flying back from Tripoli to Rome it was really pretty much towards
                    the end of the flight that his staff decided he might be briefed on what was
                    going on. So I was called back into the cabin where I spent 15 or 20 minutes
                    bringing him up to date on what was going on, who was in the government, what
                    the general circumstances were. There was interest and, as I recall, good
                    questions. He also, of course, had a briefing book, etc. There wasn't any great
                    length of time spent on it. But I don't think there was any lack of interest. It
                    was simply that perhaps he was sufficiently knowledgeable about what was going
                    on not to require a lot of updating.</p>
                <p>Then while he was in Rome, certainly as he went and made these various calls...he
                    was good at it. He certainly showed an interest in what he was being told. As
                    you well know, there are times you have visitors who appear to be totally
                    disinterested in what is going on and in the people they are seeing and they
                    behave like they really didn't want to see them anyway. That was not the case
                    with Nixon at all. The Ambassador and Mrs. Zellerbach had a big dinner with all
                    the big luminaries of the Italian government present. That is the sort of thing
                    the Italians like a great deal. They were seeking high level contacts with the
                    United States and over the years...I have had a lot to do with Italian affairs
                    over a good many years in one form or another from 1953—I had Italian affairs
                    twice in the Department and went back as Minister. So during that period every
                    time there was a conference involving the British, French and Germans, for
                    example, the Italians would be very upset if they hadn't been included. They
                    spent a great deal of time and effort in trying to persuade us that they should
                    be included, and very often because of that they were. They were playing
                    catch-up all the time and this was difficult for them. So high level visits were
                    very important to them to demonstrate to themselves and to the world that they
                    were major players in the political chess game.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was Henry Kissinger in one of his books made
                        the remark that essentially going to Italy on a high level visit really
                        played little role in anything because there was never a person you would
                        really talk to. It was a collective government, has been a collective
                        government and continues to be a collective government. Was this a fair
                        assessment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Probably fairly accurate because you might deal with a prime minister,
                    foreign minister...the president played more of a ceremonial role...and
                    everything would be fine with him. But it is true that he would not be able to
                    say, “Yes, we will do it this way.” And he might not be prime minister tomorrow.
                    You did have that feeling that you were sometimes talking into a vacuum. This
                    is, I think, true even to this very day. Although people like Andreotti - he has
                    been around so long and knows where all the levers of power are. There are lots
                    of things that the Italians have done, however, that one mustn't
                    underestimate...for example, when it came to deciding what to do with that part
                    of the 16th Air Force that was stationed in Torrejon, Spain...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about in the late 1980s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, when we renegotiated the facilities agreement with the Spanish they
                    finally said to get out. The Italians agreed to base the Air Force facilities
                    from Torrejon. This had been a pattern. The Italians earlier had agreed to house
                    our cruise missiles. They undertook to take on quite a few things of this
                    sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including sending a force to Beirut when we needed a
                        multi-international force there in the early 80s. A lot of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: A lot of things. The Southern European Task Force up in Verona where
                    they had the nuclear artillery is another thing. In spite of the Communist
                    influence and strong opposition to any of these things, the Italian government
                    was able to pull itself together, was able to accede to our request and we have
                    many facilities in Italy. During the time I was Minister there and Charg�
                    (1969-73), one always had the greatest cooperation from the Italians. So in
                    spite of their shortcomings, and their unstable governmental system, they were
                    able to produce decisions that were difficult for them. But, generally speaking,
                    the development of relations such as we have with the Prime Minister of Britain,
                    the President of France, the Chancellor of Germany, was not the sort of
                    relationship you really could develop with one of the Italian leaders. He just
                    simply didn't have the authority. Part of it, of course, comes from the fact
                    that in England you have a two party system, in Germany you have a two party
                    system with one coalition partner but the majority is pretty well defined, and
                    that has pretty much been the case in France, not always, but so under the Fifth
                    Republic. But you didn't have that situation in Italy with all these parties
                    that would have to form a government. They were all equal parties even though
                    they don't have an equal number of votes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whatever happened early on with the Socialists didn't
                        develop a being of their own. They, unlike other countries in Europe where
                        the Socialists became a major, somewhat to the left party, got gobbled up by
                        the Communists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, that was immediately after the war and lasted pretty much into the
                    60s. Then you had the opening to the left which was a much discussed policy
                    because to some people opening to the left meant moving the center towards the
                    left and to others it meant bringing what elements you could from the left
                    towards the center. It was much after this period we speak of where this began
                    to develop and we can perhaps come back to it at another time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave your time in Rome, would you describe a
                        bit about Clare Boothe Luce? How she operated? How you saw her? She was a
                        major figure in the diplomatic world of the Eisenhower era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: You may recall when she was assigned as Ambassador to Italy, the
                    Italians were anything but pleased because it was pretty much a man's world in
                    Italy and there were very few women to play a role in the body politic. There
                    was the famous cartoon in one of the leading Italian magazines showing the
                    facade of the American Embassy in Rome with the American flag hanging out in
                    front etched in lace. There was the general attitude that they had been
                    downgraded because we were sending a woman.</p>
                <p>It took her a little time, not terribly long, to persuade the Italians that she
                    was an extremely capable and tough woman. She ran really a very good Embassy.
                    She had no experience in this type of thing, but she had been involved in so
                    many things that she knew how to run things.</p>
                <p>As a DCM she had Elbridge Durbrow who actually had a Soviet background and with
                    whom I think she got along pretty well. She had a clear view of what it was she
                    wanted to do in Italy, and that was to block the Communists. The principal theme
                    that ran throughout the Embassy was to block the Communists and support the
                    democratic center...to keep Italy fully in the democratic camp and make it a
                    useful, viable part of NATO. Everything she did, the speeches that she gave were
                    aimed at these central points.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>She obviously was controversial at times because she had a very strong
                    personality and wasn't at all reluctant to express her point of few. There were
                    times that she was criticized for making speeches which were regarded as pretty
                    close to the line of interfering in domestic, internal matters. But one had to
                    remember also that in this period of time the Americans were the principal
                    factor in Italy. The British, French and others played relatively minor roles
                    compared to the American role, where the Marshall Plan, Offshore Procurements
                    and all the things I have talked about, were playing a major role in the
                    economic recovery of Italy. So the American Ambassador had a very prominent
                    position and she, being a prominent person, played a very important role in
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>Even though she had a very tough side to her, there was also a rather gentle side
                    to her...a rather thoughtful side to her. She'd had, as we all know, personal
                    tragedies. I think this made her within...although the exterior seemed cold, the
                    interior at times really could be very warm. I cite this one example of that. My
                    wife and I were married in August, 1953 and we started our married life in Rome.
                    Shortly after we were married in October, my mother died here in Washington. I
                    simply didn't have at that time, having just gotten married and everything, the
                    money to even think of coming home. Mrs. Luce suspected this might be the case
                    (it was known through the telegram that came in that my mother had died) and I
                    had a call from her secretary, Dorothy Farmer, who had been her secretary before
                    she came to Rome so was very close to Mrs. Luce. She called me and said that the
                    Ambassador was sorry to hear about my mother's death; that she wanted my wife
                    and me to go home; that she had bought airline tickets for us and that whenever
                    we could pay her back, fine, but not to worry about it. That was really an
                    extremely warm gesture and after all I had been with her only since February.
                    However, because of the role I was playing in the internal politics at that time
                    because I spoke fluent Italian, I was thrown with her more than I would have
                    been otherwise. But I don't think it made any difference because she would have
                    done that for anyone else in the Embassy. That was a very human, thoughtful
                    thing for which I was always very grateful to her.</p>
                <p>There were other instances...at one point I got fed up with the whole thing, this
                    was some years after this, and decided that I would get out of the Foreign
                    Service and be done with it. She was out of the country at the time. I decided
                    that I would just resign. I wrote a resignation telegram which had to be
                    approved by the DCM. She was in London at the time and called in to see what was
                    going on and was told that I had done this. She sent word that she would like
                    very much if I did not send the telegram until she came back. She would like to
                    talk to me. On her return I was asked to come out to the Ambassador's Residence.
                    All the senior staff had gathered there to meet with her. She kept them all
                    waiting and called me in and we had a long talk. She persuaded me not to do
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I ask what prompted this on your part?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. What prompted me I think was that I had...going back to the time I
                    was here in the Department and in Middle East affairs, had really occupied
                    positions considerably above my rank and had worked closely with the Secretary
                    of State and had done things that were already rather senior, but, for whatever
                    reasons, one never seemed to get promoted at all. I was occupying a position in
                    Rome which was really above the grade I was and I was just getting fed up with
                    it. I had been passed over once again, and decided there was no point in
                    carrying it on if this is the way it was going to be. So in a moment of
                    frustration I did this. The result was what I told you. But it was one of
                    feeling frustration and dissatisfaction over what I felt was a rather curious
                    disregard of what I thought I had done.</p>
                <p>I think it was Ambassador Luce's interest in the matter that prompted me to give
                    it another try. And then, of course, the next time I was promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the Trieste negotiations at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, because that was something that was considered to be on the foreign
                    affairs side of things and as I was doing strictly the internal side I didn't
                    get involved in that at all. She did that pretty much with the Political
                    Counselor and the number two in the Political Section at that time, a fellow by
                    the name of Lansing Collins, who handled foreign affairs matters and was
                    involved with the Foreign Office. Also, there was another officer, Jim
                    O'Sullivan, who also did some of these things. I think she worked with him on
                    that as well. But I was not involved in that at all.</p>
                <p>I will say that she was really a very good Ambassador, and when she left, she
                    gave a huge dinner party at the villa and had the Prime Minister and all the
                    people there. My wife and I were there. She was just heaped with honors and
                    farewell presents...she was given the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of
                    Italy, and then they produced a perfectly beautiful antique large crucifix which
                    had been put into a beautiful box for presentation. They were really very sorry
                    to see her go because they knew that they had a friend. They knew there was
                    somebody there who spoke directly to Eisenhower and to Dulles and had
                    influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>It is true, you know, the story about probably lead rather than arsenic poisoning
                    that took place. That was a true story and one that was actually fairly simple
                    to explain once they realized what had happened. Villa Taverna, which was the
                    Ambassador's magnificent Residence, was an old house and the floors were not
                    always absolutely immobile and before she came everything had been painted. In
                    those days I guess they used paint with lead in it. Her bedroom was directly
                    beneath the room that was used for ironing by the staff. As the floors were not
                    rigid when people walked on them there was a certain amount of motion. Over a
                    period of time bits of paint flicked off the ceiling and landed in her morning
                    coffee and things that she ate. She would always have breakfast in bed and there
                    were times when one was summoned to see her at the villa and you would go up to
                    her bedroom and conduct business with her there. Over a longish period of time
                    she was hit by this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: You know, a lot of people tried to say that this wasn't true, that this
                    was a sort of subterfuge, that she had been poisoned by the Soviets and the
                    communists, etc., which was all totally untrue. In fact the matter is that her
                    social secretary, Letitia Baldridge, who later became the social secretary for
                    Mrs. Kennedy, also had a minor case of this poisoning. But she had an office in
                    the Villa and it was the same sort of thing.</p>

                <p>STABLER: I guess I must have just made Class 3, as I remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I guess so. Then I would have become a First Secretary, although not yet
                    confirmed by the Senate by the time I departed Italy.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>When I left Washington in '53, I was acting Deputy Director of Near Eastern
                    Affairs. The reason that I wasn't full Deputy Director was because in those days
                    a Deputy Director, which was set at a civil service grade, had a certain salary.
                    As a Foreign Service officer you had a set salary and if this salary was
                    commensurate with the salary fixed for the Deputy Director then you got the job
                    paid at that level. I was only a class-4 which was not very senior, but was made
                    acting Deputy Director, but because my salary was too low they couldn't give me
                    the full title of Deputy Director. It was one of those ridiculous things...I did
                    the job of Deputy Director without the title for many months.</p>
                <p>In the latter part of '56, I had been home on leave and had come back to
                    Washington and run into my friend, Fraser Wilkins, at that time Director of Near
                    Eastern Affairs, who said, “We are going to call you back to Washington and put
                    you on the Egyptian Desk.” I said, “Fraser, I think that is eminently unfair. I
                    had the Egyptian Desk before I went to Rome—1949-52. I had done that. Then I
                    became acting Deputy Director of Near Eastern affairs, I would have been Deputy
                    Director if it hadn't been the salary thing. And now you are asking me to come
                    back at a lower grade than I was before and do the same job I did for three
                    years before.” “Well,” he said, “I know, but we can't find anybody who is as
                    qualified as you to do the Egyptian Affairs.” I said, “That is nonsense. I just
                    refuse to accept that reasoning. I think it is the sort of thing that you really
                    cannot do, to make someone do the same job over again at a lower grade than when
                    he left.”</p>
                <p>When I went back to Rome I thought this had been settled. I was absolutely
                    devastated when I was told by Jack Jernegan that I had been summoned back to
                    Washington to be on the Egyptian desk. I must say I went back with very ill
                    grace indeed. I thought it was a very low blow and was absolutely furious. I
                    made it very clear that I believed that this was something that should not have
                    been done. But I had no choice. I had to come back and go in to this. I frankly
                    went out of my way to be so difficult about it that I received an incredibly bad
                    efficiency report. It couldn't have been any worse. But I didn't care because I
                    decided that if this was the way they were going to play the game I wasn't going
                    to play it their way.</p>
                <p>That ultimately held me up quite a number of years in promotion. But so what. It
                    came out all right in the end.</p>
                <p>So I was a year in that job which I thoroughly disliked. It was after the
                    post-Aswan period when Dulles had sort of destroyed our relations with
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what you mean by the post-Aswan
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>STABLER: It was our refusal to consider being of any help to the Egyptians in the
                    building of the Aswan Dam and providing credits to do that. As a result of that
                    and President Nasser's desire to do this, he then turned to the Soviets who
                    jumped into the picture with alacrity. The United States' position in Egypt
                    absolutely shot down to the very bottom and the Soviets became the great
                    friends. This was a period also when we sent marines into Beirut in July, 1958,
                    and I was indirectly involved in that, as we all were in Near Eastern
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>It was in this period and quite well known to those who follow these things that
                    I was anything but pleased with what had happened. Findley Burns, who at that
                    time was in Personnel, later became Ambassador to Ecuador and Jordan, decided
                    that there was enough of this and arranged a transfer for me from the Near
                    Eastern Affairs into European Affairs where I became the Officer in Charge of
                    Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. Just before this happened, I
                    was summoned to Loy Henderson's office, he was then Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration, and he acknowledged that I had not been treated very fairly in
                    all of this and indicated that Bob McClintock, who then our ambassador in Beirut
                    and with whom I had worked very closely in my previous stint in Egyptian Affairs
                    when he was number two in Cairo, was looking for a new DCM and wanted to have
                    me. If I would do this and the end of perhaps a couple of years he would see
                    that I was sent to Paris. I told him that I thought as long as...I was then just
                    a new class 3 officer and there were several people in the Embassy in other
                    positions who were senior to me by two grades...we had a hierarchical system in
                    the Foreign Service it made very little sense to pick out a class 3 officer and
                    send him as DCM above the heads of several people in the Embassy and that there
                    must be plenty of 2's or 1's who would like to have the job. I really felt that
                    under the circumstances I was just not going to do it. I guess I was being
                    difficult, but I thought in a sense they were sort of bribing me, which I didn't
                    particularly care for. So I said I would prefer not to do it, but if I was
                    ordered to do it, I would do it.</p>
                <p>They did not pursue the matter and the curious thing was, this was 1958, that in
                    two years time I went to Paris anyway, so it all worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back to the time that you were on the
                        Desk, that year. You had some obvious perspective in this. You had been away
                        and often you come back with a clear view. Had you felt there was any change
                        in both Dulles and also NEA or a view of Nasser over this time? Or had it
                        just been a steady downhill?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>STABLER: Mind you I had left just shortly after Farouk had disappeared from the
                    scene, when Naguib was President in 1953. During the time I was in Rome I had
                    very little or nothing to do with Egyptian affairs. The only thing that happened
                    when I was in Rome was that Hank Byroade, Ambassador in Egypt, tried to get me
                    to come Cairo as Political Counselor. Mrs. Luce refused to release me at that
                    time, with my concurrence. So when I came back in 1957, it was really sort of a
                    new ball game as far as I was concerned. One was always generally aware of what
                    was happening and that the situation had radically changed and we were viewed
                    with considerably suspicion, and hostility by the Egyptians. I can't recall,
                    frankly, that very much really went on. I could never understand why it was
                    necessary to have me, who had been dealing with the thing in quite a different
                    context before, come back into a situation where there was really nothing much
                    one could do. Anybody could have done it. As a matter of fact my replacement had
                    very little knowledge or background on Egypt at all. There wasn't anything of
                    importance that happened during the year I did this, maybe less than a year,
                    that I did very little, indeed there just wasn't much to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in putting our troops in Lebanon right
                        after the upheaval of July 14, 1958 after the coup in Baghdad and the unrest
                        in Lebanon when we sent the Marines in? Nobody was saying, “What are the
                        Egyptians going to do if we do this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I can't remember anything like that. We were involved as we all were in
                    things like that. It was, of course, very clear to all my colleagues at that
                    time, we found this whole thing very excruciating. I think I went to Dulles
                    once, which I found an unpleasant experience, this old man who totally ignored
                    subordinates, he did not even bother to day “Good morning”. I guess Ray Hare was
                    the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs at the time. I really draw a
                    blank on that period. I do remember being active in terms of the Beirut landing,
                    but I think we all helped in what was going on in that situation. I don't recall
                    anything of major significance involving Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you served a relatively short time again within
                        Benelux affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Then I went in early '58 to Swiss/Benelux Affairs which was interesting
                    but relatively calm with no emergency that I can remember doing at that
                    particular time.</p>
                <p>Then I was shifted and became Officer in Charge of Italian/Austrian Affairs at
                    the end of 1958 or 59 which was quite congenial to me because of my knowledge of
                    the Italian situation. I don't recall any outstanding specific questions that we
                    dealt with. I dealt mostly with routine matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any differences in how these two bureaus
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>STABLER: Not really, because in both cases the leadership...I think when I first
                    joined the European Bureau in Swiss Benelux, as I recall the Assistant Secretary
                    was a career man. The deputies all were. Frankly, I found both Bureaus basically
                    well run. Perhaps the only major difference was that in the Bureau of Near
                    Eastern Affairs because there were crises, one had a bit more contact with some
                    of the people on top. While on the Swiss Benelux desk there was little contact
                    with the people in the front office, more so when I came to Italy and Austria.
                    There were Italian problems or Italian visitors or whatever...some crises
                    occasionally over the Alto Adige between Austria and Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is over the German-speaking population.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: What used to be the South Tyrol of the Austrian empire. The breakup
                    occurred after World War I and remained a sore point between the Austrians right
                    on through to post-World War II. And there were still efforts by the Austrians
                    to get it back. The Austrians always point out the differences between Italians
                    and those former Austrians living in the area. It is called the Alto Adige by
                    the Italians and the Sud Tyrol by the Austrians.</p>
                <p>But none of these were major problems requiring much attention at the Assistant
                    Secretary level..</p>
                <p>To go back a bit at the end of 1956, possibly early '57, I was instrumental while
                    in Rome in bringing about change from a Social/Communist government to a
                    democratic government in the independent Republic of San Marino which was in our
                    jurisdiction, although the Consul General in Florence was formally accredited
                    also as Consul General in San Marino. But I had been up to San Marino a number
                    of times and found it amusing and got to know the people up there. At one stage
                    in 1957...it was during the post- Hungarian Revolution of October 1956] ...and
                    there were indications that one or two of the Socialists deputies supporting the
                    Communist majority in San Marino were having some doubts about communist policy
                    and their association. I was asked by my friend, Federico Bigi, who was the head
                    of the Christian Democratic Party, to come up there and perhaps meet with a
                    couple of these doubting Thomases and see if I could persuade them to leave the
                    Social/Communist majority.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I went up there and went into a smoke filled backroom with a couple of these
                    people and talked to them at some length. The two did leave the Social/Communist
                    majority and for the first time in post-war Europe, a Social/Communist majority
                    was thrown out in a democratic process. And for the first time since the war the
                    Christian Democratic government supported by a couple of these deputies got a
                    majority and became the government of San Marino. In '59, Bigi held the position
                    of Foreign Minister in San Marino and came over to this country. One of the
                    reasons was that under San Marino law San Marino citizens who have become
                    American citizens can vote in San Marino elections. He would come over to see
                    San Marino communities, Sandusky, Ohio, is one. What he really wanted to do was
                    to meet the President in order to show at home how important he and San Marino
                    were.</p>
                <p>I was told I could have three minutes with the President and would be drawn and
                    quartered if I went over that time. So I took Bigi over myself, again for
                    interpreting. So we were taken into the President. I had been told that he was
                    extremely busy. I was able to take a look at his schedule and there wasn't a
                    thing on it except a golf game. He became quite fascinated in the conversation
                    and we were there for 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>So, in any event in 1960, Bob McBride, who had become the Director of Western
                    European Affairs, in which office I served, asked me if I would be interested in
                    going to Paris to take charge of the Political Internal Unit there, to replace
                    Dean Brown who later became Ambassador to Senegal and Jordan and Deputy Under
                    Secretary for Management, I guess at one point...he had worked with Bob McBride
                    in Paris.</p>

                <p>Today is May 6, 1991. This is a continuing series of interviews with Ambassador
                    Wells Stabler. Mr. Ambassador we stopped the last time with you leaving
                    Italian/Austrian Affairs (1959-60) and just getting assigned to Paris where you
                    served for almost five years.</p>
                <p>STABLER: I was there from September, 1960 to July, 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the assignment and what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, in early '60, the question came up about the replacement of the
                    officer in the Political Section in Paris who dealt with internal political
                    affairs. At that time I was serving in the Office of Western European Affairs
                    and Bob McBride was the Director. One day, out of the blue, he asked me one day
                    if I would be interested in being the head of the Internal Political Unit in the
                    Embassy in Paris. Obviously I thought that would be quite an interesting
                    position and accepted with alacrity.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>We then took off in September, my wife and four small children ranging from the
                    ages of 1 to 6, I think it was at the time, for Paris. I then took over as head
                    of the Internal Political Unit which consisted of myself, an assistant, and an
                    officer who did purely biographical work. I had a secretary who was an American
                    who had lived in Paris for years, spoke fluent French and who was really an
                    absolute gem as far as Foreign Service Secretary are concerned.</p>
                <p>At the time that I got there Randy Kidder was the Political Counselor and John
                    Bovey was the number two man, who also did African affairs. Amory Houghton was
                    the Ambassador. He was a political appointee of Eisenhower and was only there a
                    few months after I arrived. He left Paris the day before John F. Kennedy was
                    inaugurated as President. Shortly thereafter Kennedy named General James Gavin,
                    the President of Arthur Anderson Associates, as US Ambassador to France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation when you arrived, because
                        this was a very turbulent period. If someone wants to report on French
                        internal politics, you probably picked the greatest period since 1789.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Of course, by the time I got there de Gaulle had been firmly entrenched.
                    The Fifth Republic was then underway. So many of the old line political leaders
                    of the Fourth Republic were out of office. About all of them were studying ways
                    and means whereby somehow they could get back into power. The Gaullists,
                    so-called UNR -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was his party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, that was the Gaullist party. It was one of these organizations
                    that was put together because of the position of de Gaulle. A great many people
                    rallied around. There were other political parties represented in the Chamber of
                    Deputies, but the Gaullists were by far in the majority.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>My job really was to report on what was happening in the internal political
                    picture. I spent quite a lot of time at the outset in establishing contacts with
                    some of the leading Gaullists - not at the governmental level because those
                    Ministers and so forth were dealt with by more senior officers in the Embassy.
                    But I established contact with a group of some of the younger Gaullists who
                    apparently wanted to establish communication with the Embassy. It was
                    interesting because quite a number of these people, although they looked upon
                    the United States with a certain degree of hostility because - my theory has
                    always been that de Gaulle in order to revive the glories of France, etc. had to
                    demonstrate France's total independence from the policies of any other country.
                    But to be credible he had to demonstrate independence from the country which
                    perhaps mattered most to the Western world at that time and that was the United
                    States. So some of de Gaulle's attitude and that which was echoed by his
                    followers was one of putting the United States at arm's length. They were very
                    critical of American policy. I never had any personal problems with them and
                    they seemed to be quite anxious to talk. I met with a lot of them over a period
                    of time. I found particularly interesting that a great many of these, I don't
                    remember the numbers now, had at one time had Leader Grants to the United
                    States. So they were very familiar with the country, basically admired Americans
                    and benefited from their stay in this country. In fact, in some of the political
                    organizations of the Gaullist party they tried to copy some of the things we did
                    in political campaigns - the idea of door-to-door canvassing at the grass root
                    level. Some of these young Gaullists endeavored as time went on to get out
                    amongst the people and establish a much closer identification between the party
                    and the grass roots during campaigns, which was never the case at all in the
                    politicking of the Fourth Republic.</p>
                <p>De Gaulle was very much in the ascendancy and one of the reasons that General
                    Gavin was selected as Ambassador was the fact that he had been a young General
                    in World War II, had parachuted into France with his airborne division at some
                    stage during that war, and had replied :Nuts” when at one point, possibly at
                    Bastogne, the Germans demanded surrender. The thought was that as a World War II
                    General he would get along well with General de Gaulle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he came in on D-Day. I think he was one of the
                        first people to land.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Maybe so. I think it was the 101st. Although he spoke no French at all
                    and absolutely no previous experience in diplomacy, the theory I assume was,
                    although it was never specifically stated, that here was a General in France
                    that anticipated the liberation of France and you have a General as President of
                    France and the two ought to get along very well. Well, that really didn't prove
                    to be the case since he spoke no French. That, I think limited the ability to
                    have direct, one-on-one conversations with de Gaulle and I just don't think that
                    he was obviously up to the stature of de Gaulle in terms of international
                    relations. In any event he was only there for a little over a year—I can't
                    remember exactly how long, but it wasn't all that long.</p>
                <p>Then Chip Bohlen came and things changed because de Gaulle had very great
                    admiration for Bohlen and Bohlen spoke fluent French and he knew what he
                    wanted.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating period. I got to know many of the leaders of the Fourth
                    Republic—former Prime Ministers, etc. who were extremely anxious to maintain
                    contact with the United States. They, obviously didn't play the role that they
                    used to and therefore the Ambassador and DCM didn't really have time for them.
                    Therefore, they were not only willing but very happy to have contact with even
                    as modest a figure as a First Secretary. I found it most interesting. I kept the
                    Department informed of some of their thinking, but the fact was that they were
                    by that time completely out of the game and had really no influence whatsoever
                    in what was happening in the Gaullist government.</p>
                <p>One of the people that I used to see very regularly was the Secretary General of
                    the Socialist Party, the SFIO, Guy Mollet who had had a considerable political
                    career and been Prime Minister at the time of the British-French invasion of
                    Egypt back in 1956.</p>
                <p>But as an aside...I always found it a little strange with the way we do business.
                    A lot of these people, such as Guy Mollet, and there were others who were
                    leaders of the Fourth Republic, had had what you might call a fiduciary
                    relationship with the United States and they indeed received some financial
                    support from the US government. I would go to visit Guy Mollet and we would have
                    a nice chat. The telephone would then ring and he would look up and smile at me
                    and say, “Well, one of your colleagues is here to see me.” We would have this
                    revolving door act between myself and someone of the CIA station in Paris. He
                    wouldn't know that I was there and I wouldn't know that he was coming. I found
                    it quite frankly a rather embarrassing situation that the United States
                    government would do well to avoid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any discussion about the CIA doing this type of
                        thing...they were still politicians weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, they were. Some of them, if not all of them, were in the National
                    Assembly as the Chamber of Deputies was called in the Fifth Republic. I don't
                    know for a fact whether they were still being kept on the payroll or whether the
                    previous relationship enabled them, the CIA people, to receive perhaps a better
                    degree of information than I had. I really never knew. I am not sure to what
                    extent the Political Counselor in Paris knew all the details. I wouldn't
                    necessarily tell the Political Counselor that I had an appointment with Mollet
                    or former Prime Minister Antoine Pinay or whoever it was I was seeing, even with
                    Francois Mitterrand with whom I had some contact, not much, but some...he was
                    not my favorite in any event. I would go about my business as part of my
                    mandate. But even after this occurred there was no coordination. It was one of
                    those awkward things that I have always thought about because I always felt
                    somehow one could avoid that type of embarrassment, at least not do it on the
                    same morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Francois Mitterrand was not one of your
                        favorite people. He is now the President of France and has been for some
                        time. How did you feel about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There was the feeling that he was somewhat of an opportunist; a bit
                    “tricky”; now on this side of the situation, now on the other side. At the time
                    I would see him he was not a Socialist. I think he was what was called a
                    Radical, but certainly not in the Socialist camp. Later on he became a Socialist
                    and their leader. I think the feeling was that his position on matters was never
                    very clear and you were never really entirely sure where he stood on issues.
                    People such as Guy Mollet, a Socialist; Pinay was in Independent; Maurice Faure
                    was a Radical; Jean Lecanuet who was Christian Democrat, people of that sort you
                    knew where they stood because they were what they were and in the political
                    groupings they had been in for a long time. It was always my impression that
                    they were much more solid than Mitterrand. The only difference is, of course,
                    that the other gentlemen I speak of—Mollet is dead, Pinay may be dead - the last
                    time I saw him he was a very old man, Maurice Faure, I guess, is still
                    around—only Francois Mitterrand is President of France, so whatever he did, he
                    obviously did quite successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the very last part of the Eisenhower
                        Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feeling how Amory Houghton and others felt
                        towards the Gaullist government and all at that time and was there a change
                        when Gavin came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I don't think there was a great deal of change. I was there only the
                    last months of Amory Houghton and he didn't speak French either. He had an
                    extremely able DCM, Cecil Lyon, who spoke very good French. I wouldn't say that
                    there was a great deal of difference in the relationship between the US and
                    France, Eisenhower and de Gaulle, if you will, and the beginnings of the
                    Kennedy-Gavin-de Gaulle relationship. At least it wasn't obvious that there was
                    any change. I think it became somewhat more critical later when de Gaulle
                    marched out of NATO and when he refused the British entry into the Common
                    Market. But then also a very significant point - when, in spite of all the
                    differences we had with de Gaulle, he did stand up and was counted during the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October, 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>STABLER: Dean Acheson came over to brief de Gaulle and de Gaulle in effect said,
                    “We are with you.” And I think that made a big impression. Also de Gaulle's
                    personal participation in the Memorial Service in Paris for Kennedy and I
                    believe he also came to the United States for the funeral. So in spite of all
                    these major political problems with the French, the basic alliance, this sort of
                    love/hate relationship that has existed between the United States and France was
                    reconfirmed.</p>
                <p>Jumping ahead a little to the assassination. It was interesting to see the lack
                    of certainty on the part of the Gaullists as to what they should do. I happened
                    to be in Nice at the time that Kennedy was assassinated attending the Gaullists'
                    - UNR's - National Congress and was at a cocktail party given by some of the UNR
                    members when I got word that Kennedy had been assassinated. The American Consul
                    in Nice, Paul Duvivier I think it was at the time, and I immediately withdrew
                    from the cocktail party. The next morning I went to a plenary session of the UNR
                    in a huge big hall and as I walked down to my seat it was interesting to me to
                    see who amongst my French Gaullist friends would stop and say something to me
                    and which would somehow look the other way. It was surprising that some of the
                    ones I thought the least friendly turned out to be the warmest in their
                    expressions of sympathy and some who I thought were friends turned out to be
                    rather chicken-livered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would there be a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, again, it was the whole question of the relationship of the United
                    States. They were mixing up their human sentiments with their belief that
                    somehow the Gaullist party was not all that close to the United States. This was
                    even more apparent on the stage of this hall where there was a flag pole of one
                    sort or another. When I came in the French flag was flying right up at the top.
                    One could see that there was a discussion going on, which seemed to relate to
                    the flag. It was only during the course of the morning that they apparently
                    resolved their problem and brought the flag down to half staff.</p>
                <p>Again this was this sort of love/hate relationship. Some obviously said what did
                    this have to do with us, this is the Gaullist party congress and why should the
                    French flag take into account at all what's happened. They did resolve this but
                    it obviously took them some time to do so.</p>
                <p>This, I think was not untypical of the dichotomy in their thinking in terms of
                    the Gaullists at different levels. I think in the case of de Gaulle that he
                    would not stoop to be quite so petty about something of this sort. I mean the
                    grand gesture was part of his make up. There was an extraordinarily beautiful
                    Memorial Service for Kennedy in the Cathedral of Notre Dame which my wife and I
                    attended. De Gaulle came and it was really a very emotional moment in which de
                    Gaulle most willingly participated. Of course that was in 1963.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we go back then to an earlier period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, I want to go back because it was a very important development. In
                    the fall of 1961...because all during this period, from the time I got there in
                    1960 and '61, one of the major issues that de Gaulle had to deal with was this
                    problem of Algeria. That had become an amazingly difficult thorn in the French
                    side, the rebellion in Algeria, the inability of the French, in spite of large
                    French forces, to bring it under control. There were very strong feelings on the
                    part of many Frenchmen that it must always be “Algerie Francaise.” Finally de
                    Gaulle, recognizing that this was certainly not going to be resolved by force of
                    arms, declared that he was going to leave Algeria for the Algerians. He had gone
                    down to Algeria at some point and had made a speech from a balcony and, of
                    course he was rather good sometimes with conundrums and the famous statement he
                    made as he addressed the crowd, mostly French settlers or “pieds noirs” and
                    said, “Je vous ai compris,” -I have understood you. Well no one to this day
                    really ever knew what he meant by that...I have understood that Algeria must
                    remain French or I have understood that we aren't going to win this one and
                    Algeria will become independent?</p>
                <p>As a result of all this tension, there was the famous revolt of the generals in
                    Algeria in the early fall of 1961. This was a very serious matter because these
                    five generals and a good many of the units in Algeria turned against de Gaulle
                    and rebelled against the central authority. That night Michel Debre , who was
                    then the French Prime Minister - a Gaullist, of course, and a very faithful
                    servant of de Gaulle - .appeared on television...it was a wild appearance, he
                    was unshaven...and urged the citizens of Paris to go by whatever means,
                    horseback, car, whatever, out to Orly and Le Bourget, the two big airports, to
                    prevent the landing of the aircraft that was expected to bring troops from
                    Algeria to seize power in Paris. It was a very tense moment. I was in the
                    Embassy and we heard noise of tanks coming across the Pont de la Concorde by the
                    Assembl� Nationale on the Place de la Concorde . One really didn't know at that
                    point whether these were tanks of the forces loyal to the generals or what they
                    were.</p>
                <p>It turned out that they were tanks and armored cars of the police forces and
                    other forces loyal to General de Gaulle which had simply come into the Place de
                    la Concorde to establish positions there. The night was extremely tense. I will
                    mention one particular incident that I mention because it was perhaps not
                    untypical of what happened.</p>
                <p>There was a gentleman by the name of Maurice Ferro whom I had known in Washington
                    when he was a correspondent for the great French newspaper, Le Monde. When I got
                    to Paris I resumed my contact with him. He was an avid Gaullist and he was
                    instrumental in introducing me to many of the younger Gaullists who at that time
                    had no ministerial positions but who were movers and shakers in the UNR and with
                    whom I met many times. A number of them became good friends and some of them
                    became Ministers later on. One of them became Minister of Interior, another a
                    Minister of Posts, I think one of them became Secretary General of the UNR. All
                    of them were dyed-in-the-wool Gaullists.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>That night of the generals' revolt, I had a telephone call from Ferro asking if
                    he could urgently meet me. I suggested that we have a drink at the Crillon bar
                    and talk about things there. The thrust of his message was, “I am, of course, a
                    loyal Gaullist; the generals are about to arrive in Paris, they obviously will
                    arrest me and my family and goodness knows what will happen. Could you give me
                    asylum?”</p>
                <p>I said that unfortunately the United States had a policy against that, but that I
                    would at least offer him and his wife safety in my house. My wife was away at
                    the time. So they came to my house and spent the night there. By the time I got
                    up at 6:00 the next morning, they had left because by that time it was known
                    that the generals had failed to rally the citizens of France. They had not been
                    able, therefore, to transport their rebellion to the mainland and it was already
                    beginning to peter out even in Algeria.</p>
                <p>I mention this only because as a result of this action by Mr. Ferro he was
                    finished. The Gaullists said they wouldn't speak to him again. He had shown lack
                    of faith and the white feather had been exhibited and he had denied his master,
                    in a sense, believing that somehow de Gaulle wouldn't triumph. I don't know how
                    many Gaullists suffered this way, but he certainly was finished. I never saw him
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your point of view how did the Embassy react to this
                        situation? How did they see it? How were they calling it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, of course, it was difficult because the only information that we
                    had came really through the French television. I don't remember what was coming
                    out of the Consulate General in Algiers. It was very timely as they knew what
                    was happening. So, all we could do was to report what it was we were seeing and
                    hearing in Paris. I think, if I recall correctly, the general view was that de
                    Gaulle would probably carry the day because of his extreme basic popularity in
                    France. While there were many Frenchmen who probably were - whom they used to
                    call “pieds noirs” in Algeria - or had served in Algeria and had strong feelings
                    in that direction about Algeria, but they didn't represent the majority of the
                    French people. I think most of us probably felt that it was most unlikely that
                    the generals would carry the day and that de Gaulle would be successful in
                    putting this down. I don't recall now and I can't tell you because again the
                    Ambassador was around...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador was whom then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>STABLER: Gavin. I don't recall to what extent we really did anything or said
                    anything beyond letting it be known that our support was with de Gaulle. There
                    was no question about that. I don't remember what may have come out of
                    Washington at that time, but I seem to recall that the French government, de
                    Gaulle and Gaullists, were very appreciative of what they considered to be our
                    support for de Gaulle at this particular time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: France was still in NATO at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Everything happened very quickly. Everything was over very quickly. The
                    tense moment was that night and once nothing developed there then it was sort of
                    down hill as far as the generals were concerned. The only way they could have
                    imposed their will was by pushing de Gaulle out of office—by capturing de
                    Gaulle. That didn't happen. Once that failed, then the rebellion, itself, began
                    to peter out as far as Algeria was concerned.</p>
                <p>There was no question then that they would have been able to set up a regime in
                    Algeria and have it stick for very long without the support of the Metropole,
                    supplies and what not that would be needed. Plus the fact that there were many
                    units in Algeria that didn't respond to the generals' call. So I don't have any
                    knowledge of what, if anything, our military...or NATO would have done. As I
                    recall the Departments of Algeria were included in the original NATO boundary,
                    because that was one of the things the French demanded.</p>
                <p>It was relatively short-lived and you remember the generals were ultimately
                    arrested and put on trial, etc.</p>
                <p>This incident of course enormously strengthened de Gaulle's hand. He then was
                    able to carry out domestically a number of things. It seems to me that at this
                    point that there were then certain constitutional developments that took place
                    in France which more or less perfected the Constitution of Fifth Republic in
                    terms of the direct election of the President and things of that sort which, up
                    to that point, had not been enshrined in the Fifth Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the 1961 night of the generals and all that, the
                        next thing that occurs to me would have been the Cuban missile crisis where
                        the United States and the Soviet Union were nose to nose. It looked like
                        there was a very strong possibility that it might result in a nuclear war.
                        How did we view that from the Embassy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>STABLER: The news coming out of Washington was increasingly threatening in terms
                    of what seemed to be building up. The Embassy role in this at that point became
                    one of being sure that the French were aware of what actually was happening. Of
                    course, this type of situation was handled, obviously, at the very top level and
                    beyond the news reports coming out of what was happening, the recognition in
                    Washington was that it was important that we bring all our allies on board and
                    make them aware of actually what U-2 pictures showed. That, I think, was the
                    mission that Dean Acheson had in coming over.</p>
                <p>It seems to me that at the time the missile crisis took place Bohlen was there. I
                    think that was true. He hadn't been there very long. So he then accompanied
                    Acheson on the call on de Gaulle. The object behind this was, again, as I say,
                    to take to de Gaulle the evidence we had. My recollection is that he rather
                    pushed the evidence aside and said that we could be sure that France will stand
                    shoulder to shoulder with the United States in a war situation. I think this was
                    a very important aspect of the US-French relationship to know that in spite of
                    all his varied differences with us and many other areas of the world on how
                    things were being done...the idea of US hegemony and the like, which was part of
                    the reason they left NATO...on major questions of war and peace the French
                    remained our loyal ally. I don't think that anybody had any doubt that what de
                    Gaulle said was what he meant. That was one of the very important milestones in
                    the French-American relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your dealing with the politicians, was this reflected
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, don't forget that the Fourth Republic politicians deplored
                    everything that de Gaulle did. Therefore, they took the view that de Gaulle was
                    mistaken in his attitude on everything. They obviously supported the United
                    States. They probably didn't pay much attention to what Europe would do when he
                    said they were with us. The Gaullists, themselves, I think were guided by what
                    the General said. So some of them may not have been so much with us, but they
                    obviously followed the leader. I think on the whole that you would say that the
                    French political class, in any event, was clearly behind us and were supportive
                    in this particular situation. I am not sure, now that I look back on it, to what
                    extent the French people were really aware of the gravity of the situation.</p>
                <p>Again, it came and went with a certain amount of speed —about a week. Then the
                    horizons cleared again and we got back to business. Then it was after that that
                    de Gaulle began taking positions with respect to NATO and keeping the British
                    out of the Common Market. So his major blueprint carried on in spite of these
                    various ups and downs—the Algerian thing, the missile crisis, the assassination
                    of Kennedy, and the like. One has to draw a distinction here between the
                    Gaullists and their attitude towards the United States and policy followed by de
                    Gaulle and the attitude of the Fourth Republic politicians all of whom were, of
                    course, increasingly frustrated because the years of participation in the
                    goodies of government were gone. They were essentially non-players. De Gaulle
                    paid little attention to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>In all of this there appeared to be an increasing public dissatisfaction with the
                    somewhat imperial nature of the Gaullist regime. And in spite of at least one
                    assassination attempt on de Gaulle which I recall, which rallied people around a
                    little bit, as the elections approached for the National Assembly in 1964, there
                    was a very strong feeling...because one of my functions was to keep in close
                    touch with the so-called political journalists, many of whom were products of
                    the Fourth Republic...most of these commentators had the feeling that as the
                    elections were approaching the dissatisfaction with de Gaulle was increasing and
                    that there was a good likelihood that the Gaullists would not get a majority in
                    the next Assembly and would have to make some sort of a deal with some of the
                    parties of the Fourth Republic who might begin to show life again.</p>
                <p>The Political Section of the Embassy was fairly convinced that the Gaullists
                    would not demonstrate the strength they had before. There was, however, a group
                    which was a public opinion group, IFOP -”Institut Francais d'Opinion Publique” -
                    run by a man named Sadoun, a very nice fellow, whom I knew well. Apparently the
                    Gaullists had commissioned rather secretly a public opinion poll in connection
                    with this election.Again, it is one of those things that is sort of regrettable,
                    but there we are. At the time that I was preparing messages that would seem to
                    indicate that possibly the Gaullists wouldn't do very well, the CIA station had
                    managed to get a copy of the public opinion poll which they didn't share with
                    anybody, which showed that the Gaullists would really do much better then
                    expected. I wasn't made privy to this, so I went out on a limb somewhat and
                    called it wrong.</p>
                <p>The Gaullists really did extremely well which was a great surprise to most of the
                    political commentators. But I will say that most of the political coverage was
                    done by people who were fashioned, brought up in the Fourth Republic and who
                    perhaps didn't have a great deal of love for the Gaullists because they were not
                    as privy to what went on as they were during the Fourth Republic.</p>
                <p>So the upshot of all this was that the Gaullists did quite well which was
                    foreseen in this opinion poll. The polling institute was fashioned largely on
                    the model of American public opinion institutes—Gallup and others—and introduced
                    a whole new element into French political life because they turned out to be
                    remarkably accurate.</p>
                <p>That only demonstrates that the talk that one heard from many who were believed
                    to be well in touch with what was going on reflected a dissatisfaction to what
                    was happening in France...the character of the Fifth Republic. The
                    dissatisfaction with the somewhat patronizing attitude of some of the Gaullist
                    party leaders who were in the saddle and nothing else was riding except that.
                    This irritated people. It cast over the situation the feeling, in any event,
                    that there was growing popular dissatisfaction.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Well, that was 1964. It was so many years after that...I think it was about '66
                    or '67...when indeed all of this erupted and the students began to demonstrate.
                    So, it was there, but hadn't yet simply come to the surface. I think some of us
                    who dealt with these issues...I found this message I prepared on what I thought
                    might be the outcome of the elections was one obviously which I didn't sign off
                    myself...and I don't mean to say that anybody else shared the lack of vision
                    that perhaps I had... but there wasn't any strong objection on the part of those
                    who read the message—maybe that was misplaced faith in my abilities. But there
                    didn't seem to be any strong sentiment that perhaps that wasn't correct.</p>
                <p>But it did again show the unfortunate lack of coordination that exists in
                    embassies between various units. If I had had access to the public opinion poll,
                    in light of my recognition that the polling organization was pretty good, I
                    would have been forced to take another look at what I thought was the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Ambassador Bohlen operate and how well did he use
                        the Embassy? How effective was he in dealing with de Gaulle and the French
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think when Gavin left and Bohlen came there was a general feeling that
                    the Embassy was now in the charge of a real professional and would pull together
                    in a much better way. I think that by this time—I can't remember if Randy Kidder
                    was still there, about to go or had gone—we had a new Political Counselor,
                    Norman Anschutz who had not had much experience in that particular area. Cecil
                    Lyon was there as DCM with Bohlen for a while. When he left Bob McBride, who was
                    very much a professional, came. The general feeling was that the Embassy would
                    pull together and it operated in a much more coordinated way with some of these
                    institutional imperfections that we don't seem to be able quite ever to deal
                    with.</p>
                <p>Bohlen turned to his staff. He knew who they were and used them. He also knew
                    what he was doing. He had good relations with the French government and clearly
                    had the respect of de Gaulle. So, while the circumstances basically didn't
                    change, the ability of the United States to report, to influence to a certain
                    extent, improved. Any foreign government is certainly inclined to deal with an
                    embassy more effectively when it knows it is well lead. When the ambassador is
                    not quite up to task then things begin to fall apart a bit and more is done in
                    Washington, or what ever. One felt that when Bohlen came that things would
                    concentrate more in the embassy. Bohlen was there during the missile crisis,
                    when Kennedy was assassinated, etc. The fact was that he was there was an
                    important factor in the stature of the Embassy vis-a-vis the French
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>We had very good relations with the Foreign Minister, Couve de Murville who was
                    obviously an instrument of de Gaulle, there was no question about that.
                    Eventually, I guess, he became Prime Minister at one point. Michel Debre was a
                    tough character. He was enormously loyal to de Gaulle and carried out de
                    Gaulle's wishes. I met him much later when he was no longer Prime Minister and
                    found him delightful...very intelligent person and at that time no longer in
                    office and able to take a slightly different view of things. I guess he was
                    succeeded by Pompidou who was an enormously intelligent man and later became
                    President of France. [I will go into that later on. I was assigned by the
                    Department to accompany Nixon when he went to the Pompidou funeral in Paris—he
                    was President and died in office.]</p>
                <p>There was not a great deal that the Embassy could do in trying to shift de Gaulle
                    away from certain basic things. De Gaulle decided in order to demonstrate French
                    independence and his position as the glory of France that he would leave NATO.
                    That was a policy that he was going to follow and there was not much that could
                    be done by anybody to keep him from shutting the British out of the Common
                    Market. At that particular time we were still very much in support of the idea
                    of a United Europe and the Common Market was part of that so the extension of
                    the Common Market to include the British would be very much part of our policy
                    line at the time. But those were problems on which de Gaulle was adamant and
                    there was nothing that anybody could do to talk him out of it.</p>
                <p>Although there were difficulties created for us by de Gaulle's rule in France,
                    still France became a much more formidable ally and a better country as a result
                    of what he did. After all, France was at the very bottom as a result of the war
                    and their whole behavior and performance of that. De Gaulle brought France back
                    up to a position of certain strength and prominence in world affairs, which I
                    would think would be a much more valuable asset than a France that was totally
                    divided under the Fourth Republic. That France could never make up its mind
                    about anything, and the musical chairs that they played, which in that instance
                    was a great deal more important than, for example, the political games that are
                    played in Italy and haven't made a great deal of difference. In France they were
                    simply wishy-washy and couldn't make a decision about anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within our Embassy, economic and political reporters,
                        maybe even CIA and military, did you find a division? De Gaulle raised a lot
                        of hackles in the United States and people can't help but every once and a
                        while not look at the great good even though they are professional Foreign
                        Service officers, but to personalize these things. Was this a problem of
                        having Gaullists and anti-Gaullists within our Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>STABLER: There was a great deal of frustration and annoyance with de Gaulle over
                    some of the things that he did. No question that the military found it quite
                    exasperating when it came to their efforts to have the same type of relationship
                    with the French military that they had with the British military, for example.
                    It became increasingly difficult as de Gaulle's policy changed. You couldn't
                    find a great many prominent military people who thought that de Gaulle was their
                    idol by any means. And, I think that also on the political-economic side there
                    were certain divisions within the Embassy as to whether this was a good or bad
                    thing. I think those of us in the purely internal side of the Political
                    Section...as far as I was concerned, it was my feeling that what de Gaulle was
                    doing in terms of building up the Fifth Republic was a good thing. Even though
                    de Gaulle caused some problems, still his creation of a system which showed some
                    stability and which was rationalized so that you weren't having these perfectly
                    horrible political games with all these parties and inability to keep a
                    government together, etc. was a very positive development.</p>
                <p>His system came closer to our system. The difficulty was that in the French
                    system there was the Gaullist party and then all the other parties. The lack of
                    stability came from the fact that you had no alternating majorities—which may be
                    the trouble in Spain today, the fact that the Socialists are in power but there
                    really isn't a viable alternative. In the case of France, you had the Gaullists,
                    which didn't have any meaningful opposition - that came later, of course, when
                    the Gaullists unhappily fell apart. Now you have the Socialists in France that
                    are relatively well knit, but you did not have a viable alternative at that
                    moment.</p>
                <p>So, for the internal political side of France, I think the Embassy as a whole
                    believed that this was a good development. Those dealing with external affairs
                    would, of course, find considerable frustrations in terms of French position on
                    foreign policy matters which very often didn't coincide with others. We have
                    talked about the military side.</p>
                <p>On the economic side, there were problems in French relations towards their
                    colonies in Africa. We had problems with the French concerning economic
                    bilateral relationships. They were perhaps not as serious as the military side.
                    So what went on in the Embassy was a reflection of what was happening in France
                    itself in the different positions that they took on different questions. There
                    were many of us there who had to admire de Gaulle's ability to run an extremely
                    difficult country.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I, of course, had nothing to do with de Gaulle, but just an amusing episode. When
                    the Kennedys came to Paris in 1963 for the State Visit - I had known the
                    President before and had known, perhaps slightly better, Mrs. Kennedy - but this
                    doesn't matter, I think all the diplomatic officers were asked to the huge big
                    white tie reception at the Elys�e Palace following the State dinner. My wife and
                    I went through the line and the Kennedys were very nice and greeted us warmly,
                    particularly Mrs. Kennedy.Then we went into the large reception hall. The waters
                    of the Red Sea parted as the two Presidents walked along, stopping every so
                    often to speak to someone. I was standing at the corner where the line had
                    opened up. As they walked down the corridor, Kennedy stopped to talk to somebody
                    and de Gaulle who was a little ahead of him happened to stop where I was
                    standing...we were shoulder to shoulder. So, I said a little something to him. I
                    may have even said something to the effect that it was a little hot in there,
                    which it was. He said he thought it was too and something to the effect that
                    “tout le monde est ici” - everybody in the world is here. That was the extent of
                    our exchange.</p>
                <p>Out in the corridor just by the front door as we were leaving you have no idea
                    the number of diplomatic colleagues, foreigners and Americans, who rushed up to
                    me and asked what de Gaulle had said to me. I said, “Well, he said it was quite
                    hot.” They obviously thought I was getting the latest and last word on the
                    Common Market or NATO or something. I was sorry to have to disappoint them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with internal affairs, what were our standing
                        orders as far as dealing with the Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: We had, of course, an officer in the political section who handled
                    communist matters which was not only involved French relations with the Soviet
                    Union and the Soviet bloc countries but also reported on what was happening in
                    the French Communist Party. We had somebody with both Soviet Union and Eastern
                    European background. At that time the standing order was no contacts with the
                    diplomats of the Soviet Union. Maurice Thorez was then secretary general of the
                    French Communist Party. As I recall, at that particular time, there was no
                    contact with the Communist Party. I must say that my mandate as head of the
                    internal political situation covered everything but the Communist Party. That
                    was always dealt with by a different officer. So what was reported was what
                    observers said, what Thorez said, and what could be learned from whatever source
                    about the French Communist party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our feeling about the whole communist threat of
                        France? Did we see it as a viable, political threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>STABLER: No. I think that the days of the communist threat had been years before.
                    By the time the Fifth Republic had come into being and de Gaulle was firmly in
                    power the Communist Party was not a major threat. Of course, the
                    Communist-controlled labor confederation- the CGT- was big and had great
                    influence in the various trade unions. But the whole thrust of the Fifth
                    Republic had been to diminish the position strength of traditional parties and
                    the communist control of the labor movement. The Communist Party was not, at the
                    time I was there, a serious threat. There were strikes, but I don't recall
                    anytime during the five years I was in Paris when one was concerned about the
                    potential of the Communist Party to do any serious damage. The elections results
                    gave them small numbers. They were stronger, of course, then the Socialists at
                    that time. They still were watched with considerable attention because they were
                    clearly a Stalinist party, supported by the Soviet Union and therefore
                    represented potentially a threat. But not a serious threat during that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ....I can remember we had youth officers who were to make
                        contact with the youth of the country because they were considered to be the
                        people who were to come up. And we did this in 1967. How did this kind of
                        approach affect your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Let me just say one more thing about the Communists. One always has to
                    remember that the entire Communist Party position to take over Western Europe,
                    had been also considerably compromised by the uprising in Budapest. So that
                    still had a considerable effect on the activities and strength of the Communist
                    Party.There was disillusionment on the part of many who had been in the
                    Communist Party by the Hungarian events. Perhaps a little bit less than in Italy
                    because the French Communist Party was much more Stalinist, much more rigid than
                    the Italians who after Budapest were more disillusioned by Communism.</p>
                <p>I don't really recall that in France, at the time I was there, that the Bobby
                    Kennedy syndrome had really much effect on what went on in France. I don't
                    recall, for example, that any youth officers were specifically designated. I had
                    an assistant, Francis de Tarr, a Foreign Service Officer who had studied France
                    in the previous Republics and who had as an undergraduate written a book on the
                    Radical Socialists. He was somewhat younger and kept in touch with some of the
                    younger political people. He was very much affected by his own intimate
                    knowledge of the Radical Socialist leaders of the Fourth Republic. I think he
                    had some trouble in equating with de Gaulle because he had an in depth knowledge
                    of one of the major elements of the Fourth Republic.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I don't recall that he was designated to deal with youth, so-called. We had a
                    very active Leader Grant program. One's efforts always were, of course, to try
                    to identify potential younger leaders we thought would have a future and bring
                    them into the Leader Grant program. The thrust of it all was not to preach to
                    the converted but to find people who had serious misconceptions about the United
                    States. We believed - and this was a principal objective of the Leader Grant
                    Program - that by inviting such people to the US, by letting them travel around
                    and see the country and meet a whole range of Americans, the Grantees might come
                    back with a better appreciation of our country. We aimed at people in their
                    middle 20's and 30's who perhaps would play a leader role in the future in
                    France. I think that on the whole we had considerable success with the Leader
                    Grant Program. I know that several of those Grantees became Ministers in a
                    Government under de Gaulle and that their attitude towards us was much more
                    friendly than if they had never been to the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One more thing before we leave France, I never served in
                        France and like other places except even more so in Europe, the
                        intelligentsia, which we don't have in the United States, at least one that
                        plays a role...within Europe everybody knows what/who it is. Could you talk
                        a little about our dealings with it and how they looked upon the United
                        States and how we evaluated this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There was a division within the intelligentsia—those who supported de
                    Gaulle and those who thought he was an aberration. You would see this reflected
                    in Le Monde, which is an interesting and thoughtful newspaper. The writers had
                    mixed feelings on the subject of how France should be governed. Also mixed
                    feelings in terms of relations with the United States. There was no difference
                    between them and other elements of society with equal levels of education. When
                    I traveled in France I never experienced any degree of hostility about the
                    United States. I think the average citizen looked upon the United States as a
                    friendly country.</p>
                <p>The intelligentsia regarded de Gaulle as somewhat of an upstart and not quite in
                    their sort of mold. Bohlen, I think had a certain contact with a lot of these
                    people. But, again, I am not sure to what extent they really influenced the
                    course of events. They wrote an enormous amount of literature, of course, about
                    every subject known to man, but I don't think de Gaulle was to be dissuaded from
                    what he thought was the right course of action by the preachings of some of the
                    intelligentsia who didn't agree with his views at all and others who did. They
                    didn't play a very significant role in terms of what de Gaulle was trying to do.
                    He set his course and on he went.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>But I think those five years were very interesting years because of the position
                    that I occupied most of the time that I was there—head of the internal political
                    unit. Towards the end I was acting political counselor for a short period of
                    time. I left in July, 1965. I didn't sit in the councils of the Ambassador, in
                    terms of being head of a section. Apparently they were satisfied with what I was
                    doing, but it was largely a reporting responsibility and not one of
                    collaborating with the Ambassador and setting or recommending policy. I worked
                    hardly at all with Gavin. I worked more with Bohlen because, again, one was
                    dealing with a professional. And Bohlen was personally responsible for my
                    promotion from FSO-3 to FSO-2. He went to bat for me and I received it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very important promotion under the old system. The
                        equivalent of going from a colonel to a brigadier general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Bohlen apparently was amazed when he learned I was not a FSO-2 (I didn't
                    know this until later) and personally went to bat for me. So I think I got FSO-2
                    just shortly before I left Paris—then FSO-1 followed fairly quickly there
                    after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The surprising thing is that you keep going back to where
                        you started. You keep getting promoted but you were sent back to the
                        Italian, Austrian and Swiss Desk—1966-69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, although that was slightly different then. From Paris I went to
                    Senior Seminar and by that time you were called Country Director—they changed
                    the titles. I think I got FSO-1 when I was doing that. It is quite true I had
                    had Italian Affairs before, but that I didn't mind because it was an interesting
                    area of Europe and I ended up as Minister in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to touch on this and then we will stop. So really
                        from 1967 to '69 you were dealing with Italian, Austrian, Swiss affairs.
                        What were your major concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I want to mention just briefly my time at the Senior Seminar because it
                    was really a very worthwhile experience. I was uncertain when I was chosen as to
                    whether it was a plus or minus. It was presented, obviously, as being the
                    equivalent of the War College, as it was then called. The head of it, the
                    Coordinator, was FSO Lewis Jones, with whom I had worked very closely in the
                    early 50's when he was Director of Near Eastern Affairs. He was a man of quite
                    vivid imagination. That year we spent in the Senior Seminar was the time that
                    civil rights was very much on the table and we did a lot of traveling in this
                    country. We went a great deal into this question of civil rights. It was a
                    marvelous eye-opener — learning something about your own country. We had many
                    different aspects of it. People would come in an talk about modern American art,
                    about music, about literature, an extensive review of what was happening in this
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>In the winter of 1966 we were given the opportunity to visit parts of the world
                    we didn't know. I had an absolutely fascinating month-long trip to the Far East
                    and did a paper on the strategic circle around China. Then we all went to the
                    White House and were given our diplomas by President Johnson in an effort to
                    maximize this particular course. It is one that I am sorry has perhaps lost some
                    of the respect - even glamour - that it should have had..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took it almost exactly ten years later—1974-75. It was
                        still a very good course. I learned a lot about the United States, but we
                        didn't see the President. Money was cut so there wasn't as much travel,
                        although you could move around quite a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: It is just one of those things. I think the Department always makes a
                    mistake when it creates something of this sort. It ought to then stick with it
                    and decide that that is a good thing and make the money available so that those
                    who are taking this course are in effect recognized for what they are supposed
                    to be. Not have it cut back all the time and lose its stature with other
                    branches of government and vis-a-vis the War College.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I wanted to mention that because I felt it was a great year.</p>
                <p>In 1966, I was then asked if I would be interested in being Country Director for
                    Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. I felt that was fine because I wanted to remain
                    in Western Europe. So even though I had done somewhat the same thing before, I
                    didn't have the same feeling that I had had previously about having to go back
                    to Near Eastern Affairs.</p>
                <p>It was an active period because during that time, from the fall of '66 to the
                    summer of '69, when I went back to Rome as Minister, we were taking more
                    seriously in Italy the question of enlarging the base of democracy. It had
                    always suffered because although the Christian Democrats remained the biggest
                    party in the Italian political spectrum, they never had enough to really form an
                    absolute majority so they were always dependent on the three so-called lay
                    parties, the Liberals, Republicans and Social Democrats, who were very small in
                    number. The question was could you not somehow encourage a further development
                    of the Socialists - away from the Communists - and bring the Socialist Party
                    into the democratic spectrum, and thus make it possible perhaps ultimately to
                    have a Socialist Prime Minister, but where the base of the democratic system
                    would be larger than it was. This was debated back and forth and ultimately it
                    was decided that we could support this opening to the left—”Apertura a
                    Sinistra”, as it was called in Italian. Of course, those who didn't favor it at
                    all regarded it as moving the Christian Democrats to the left and those of us
                    who believed that you were working toward increasing the democratic base argued
                    that .by opening to the left you were opening the opportunity to the left to
                    move to the democratic center. Ultimately that was the policy that was
                    approved.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I can remember at that point there was a very complicated hierarchy at the
                    National Security Council consisting of different types of committee. I don't
                    remember all the various ins and outs of that, but all these things went through
                    the whole stage of National Security Council consideration and ultimately
                    approval. This was one of the principal matters that we dealt with.</p>
                <p>Also at that time it seems to me that we also agreed that there could be limited
                    contacts, very controlled, with the Communist Party. That was then endorsed. Not
                    a National Security Council decision as I recall, but simply a determination
                    made, perhaps at the level of Under Secretary for Political Affairs, to make
                    possible at least some form of contact with lower level members of the Italian
                    Communist Party.</p>
                <p>And, of course, during that time there were the usual visits of Italian
                    Presidents, and the unending effort to try to satisfy the Italian desire to
                    participate in different things. You would have these four-power meetings before
                    the talks with the Soviets on Germany. The Foreign Ministers of the four Western
                    powers would get together, the Germans, British, French and ourselves and you
                    would have these angry screams from the Italians saying, “What about us?” We
                    would scramble around to try somehow to keep them happy because in spite of the
                    fact that there were those who, not incorrectly, believed that the bilateral
                    talks with the Italians never produced anything particularly, Italy had been and
                    still was an extremely good ally. There was a lot of real estate in Italy
                    occupied by US troops. They had access to various ports in Italy—the Sixth
                    Fleet. We had Air Force units, even our atomic artillery, in Northern Italy.
                    They were a loyal member of NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add, this has continued to this day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: It has indeed. They acted immediately to take in the Air Force units
                    coming out of Spain. So I think those of us dealing with Italian affairs spent a
                    lot of time during that period of trying to get the upper levels of government
                    to recognize that while in some instances this might be a nuisance, there was a
                    very good political reason for making the Italians feel that they were
                    participants on the same level as some of these other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost built into your job was that you had to be kind of
                        a prickly character within European Affairs—to be watching all the time that
                        the Italians weren't slighted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>STABLER: There would be situations where without any consultation with me
                    decisions would be made—we are going to have this quadrilateral meeting. Then
                    the Italians found out about it. The Ambassador would come rushing in to see the
                    Assistant Secretary and the Minister would come rushing in to see me. I would
                    then be called by the Assistant Secretary asking what we could do about this.
                    Then I would have to write memos and lobby round to get the people up the line
                    to recognize that they just had to do it. One also had to be careful that you
                    didn't wear out your welcome and still make clear that this was a serious
                    problem touching on genuine US interests - that you were not just regarded as an
                    agent of the Italians, but that there was a good justification from the US
                    interest point of view to do this. Those were the major things with the
                    Italians.</p>
                <p>I don't remember a great deal that went on with respect to Austria. During that
                    time we did have a visit of the Chancellor of Austria, Chancellor Klaus .
                    Relations were on the whole on an even keel. I think the Chancellor's visit was
                    part of the effort to have various European leaders come. There wasn't much that
                    developed from that trip. The only thing I found rather surprising was that we
                    had asked the Chancellor to come to New York and fly to Chicago and then out to
                    California as part of the trip. The Washington and New York visits went
                    well.</p>
                <p>Then I was absolutely horrified to discover before it all took place that for the
                    portion from here to Chicago, California and back they had given the Chancellor
                    a rather small propeller driven plane. I got in touch with the White House and
                    asked why we were insulting this gentleman, a guest of the President, by sending
                    him on an executive propeller plane that is going to take a month of Sundays to
                    go from point A to point B. Well, they said they didn't have any planes
                    available, they were all being used. I said that perhaps some general would have
                    to give up his jet. They then offered a jet without windows. I didn't think that
                    was very nice to ask this man to come to the United States, fly across it and
                    not be able to look out a window while doing so.</p>
                <p>The upshot of it was that nothing worked and they produced a propeller-driven
                    plane that took us from Washington to Chicago and then we had to borrow a Gulf
                    Oil executive jet to do the rest of the trip. I never got over that. Again it
                    was one of those things that was so unnecessary. And again where one branch of
                    government doesn't care much about what another branch is doing.</p>
                <p>Most of our problems with the Swiss at that time had to do with two things. One
                    was the drafting of Swiss citizens into the US armed forces—Vietnam was still
                    on. The other was the cooperation of the Swiss with us in tracking organized
                    crime through Swiss banking accounts.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The first problem was of interest because there was a Treaty of Commerce,
                    Friendship, and Navigation between the United States and Switzerland that went
                    back many years—maybe as far back as the late 1800s—which clearly exempted
                    citizens from service in the armed forces of the other nation. The Swiss would
                    say that they had a treaty with us and that Swiss citizens could not be drafted
                    into the US armed forces. We would say that that was very nice of course, but
                    that there was an act of Congress that required all permanent residents of this
                    country to register and be subject to the draft. The Swiss would reply that that
                    was domestic legislation while this was an international treaty. We would say
                    that under our system a subsequent law overturns a previous law.</p>
                <p>We found ourselves in a total bind. Congress was not the least bit sympathetic to
                    the fact that we had a treaty, so we continued to draft Swiss citizens who had
                    green cards, were permanent residents in this country but not US citizens. I
                    think some were sent to Vietnam and one killed there. We never resolved it in my
                    day. I always felt it was strange that a treaty could be overturned by a
                    subsequent purely domestic law which does not take into account the treaty
                    obligations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little background on that. I went out in 1969 as Consul
                        General in Saigon. We had some of these problems. There was the element that
                        a person who said he was a permanent resident, which meant they could live
                        in the United States forever, could say that he didn't want to be a
                        permanent resident anymore, I want to go back. They would then give up all
                        chance of becoming an American citizen, which, of course, was not what they
                        wanted to do. There had been considerable problems with this. It all started
                        with a singer called, I think, Dick Haynes , who was born in Argentina and
                        stayed out of World War II because of this. It was not as clear cut. It was
                        used by a good number of people to avoid the draft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There is no question about that. The only thing is that the treaty very
                    clearly said that the citizens of one country do not have to serve in the armed
                    forces of another. These citizens were still citizens. They lived in this
                    country permanently, but they didn't have the vote. They had the advantages of
                    everything but voting. We should have demanded the renegotiation of the treaty
                    to cut this out, which, of course, would have meant American citizens ultimately
                    would have been put into the Swiss armed forces. But I always thought it rather
                    strange that you could unilaterally legislate a change in an international
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, has always been a problem. We have had a

                <p>STABLER: No, not really that I can recall. No major problems. I really didn't
                    spend a great deal of time on Austrian affairs because the situation was on the
                    whole fairly normal. The state treaty was carried out quite faithfully. The only
                    thing that I found nice was that the Austrian DCM ultimately became my colleague
                    in Madrid when he became the Austrian Ambassador.</p>

                <p>STABLER: I had always enjoyed the close association with Italy and while at the
                    Senior Seminar I was offered the Country Director of Italy and Austria. As I
                    wanted to stay in Western Europe at that particular point in the game the offer
                    seemed fairly good. So I was in that job from 1966-69. In December of 1967
                    Lyndon Johnson decided to remove Freddy Reinhardt as Ambassador to Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was behind that removal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: He was a career officer and had been in Rome already for I think four or
                    five or maybe more years. Johnson had gone out to the Far East to be with the
                    troops in Vietnam over Christmas of 1967 and on the way back he wanted to go to
                    Rome to see the Pope. That was, let's face it, sort of a political stop.</p>
                <p>Freddy Reinhardt sent a message indicating that in light of our relations with
                    Italy it was absolutely unthinkable that the President of the United States
                    should come to Rome to see the Pope only and not to call on the President of
                    Italy. He made this argument with some force and obviously was backed up by the
                    State Department. So Johnson did it, but was apparently annoyed that he had to
                    do so. A call was arranged on the President of Italy at the Castel Porziano,
                    which was the country place outside of Rome which was reserved for the President
                    of Italy. Johnson out there, spent a relatively short time with the President
                    and left. Then, of course, he also saw the Pope.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Apparently Johnson, who liked to have things done his way, was irritated with
                    Reinhardt that he made him also go to see the President of Italy. It was within
                    very few days after Johnson returned to the States that he determined that he
                    was going to remove Reinhardt. I had the somewhat unpleasant task of calling
                    Reinhardt up in the mountains of Italy where he was skiing over New Year's. - I
                    think I had to call him New Year's Eve - and tell him that the President was
                    going to request an agr�ment for a new Ambassador who was going to be Gardner
                    Ackley.</p>
                <p>Gardner Ackley at that point was the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors
                    to the President. Gardner had been a Fulbright professor in Rome quite a few
                    years before that. While he was there, and he told me the story a number of
                    times, he and his wife did a good deal of walking around and they used to walk
                    around the outside of the grounds of Villa Taverna which was the residence of
                    the American Ambassador in Rome. They fell in love with Rome and fell in love
                    with the idea of Villa Taverna. So as the time came to move along from the
                    Council of Economic Advisors he sought the appointment as Ambassador to Rome.
                    This happened to fit into Johnson's plans to get rid of Reinhardt and give
                    something to Ackley.</p>
                <p>So that is what happened. I then was very much involved in the early part of 1968
                    in the briefing of Gardner Ackley. We became good friends. In early 1969, after
                    Nixon had been inaugurated, one of the first appointments that he made as
                    Ambassador was that of Frank Meloy who was DCM in Rome. He was named as
                    Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. The reason for that was that when Frank
                    Meloy was DCM in Rome, Nixon visited there as a private citizen and in some
                    missions that he visited not much attention was paid to him. But Frank Meloy
                    made a particular effort to be nice to him and to brief him and to have
                    something at his house in his honor that paid him a compliment as former Vice
                    President. This made a great impression on Nixon. Those who had not been nice to
                    him quickly found themselves out of office, those who had been nice to him
                    quickly found themselves either with a better Embassy or as in the case of Frank
                    Meloy with their first Embassy.</p>
                <p>So that position of DCM Rome became vacant. Because of my association with Italy
                    and my friendship with Gardner Ackley...he obviously had something to do with my
                    assignment as DCM in Rome. That is the background of how I got to Rome.</p>
                <p>I went to Rome in June, 1969. Frank Meloy had already left. Ackley was still
                    Ambassador. It was in August of 1969 that we received a message at the Embassy
                    announcing the request for agr�ment for Graham Martin as Ambassador. I had the
                    sad duty of informing Gardner Ackley that this was the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he must have been prepared for this with a change in
                        the Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: He was dreading this because he had only been there about a year. He was
                    looking for possible ways to stay on.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember later I was there when Richard Gardner was
                        Ambassador and he somehow hoped he would make it through with the Reagan
                        Administration. Of course, it never would have happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: All do. John Volpe thought the same thing. There are many instances in
                    which it is quite clear they are not going to stay on because they come from
                    different parties.</p>
                <p>As always the Department said they must have the agr�ment immediately. I think I
                    broke all records and got it for them in three hours. That was done by calling
                    one of my friends and contacts at the Quirinale, Palace of the President of
                    Italy. It was Piero Marras who was press spokesman to President Saragat and also
                    very close to him. He made an end run and personally called Saragat who was out
                    of Rome and obtained oral agreement. So within three hours I was able to cable
                    back that agr�ment had been given. Then we did the more formal request through
                    the Foreign Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record I might just mention that before any
                        country sends an ambassador they get an approval (agr�ment) before any
                        announcement is made just in case for some reason the ambassador might not
                        be receivable at the other place, which happens from time to time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Basically it is a courteous request for acceptance of an Ambassador by
                    the foreign country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graham Martin certainly later in his career had a
                        controversial reputation about being a difficult man to work for. At this
                        time, before he arrived, how was the news that he was going to be ambassador
                        received by you and by others in the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I can't remember now whether I have been over this before, but when I
                    was in Senior Seminar in '65-'66 I made a trip for the first time ever for me to
                    the Far East. Among the places I visited was Bangkok where Graham Martin at that
                    time was the Ambassador. I remember going to lunch, my wife and I, with the then
                    DCM and his wife. The entire meal was spent first by the wife before her husband
                    returned home and then by both of them at lunch, in telling us what an extremely
                    difficult and disagreeable person Graham Martin was and how impossible it was to
                    work with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>This meant nothing to me then. I had met Martin briefly when I was there as part
                    of my paper I was preparing for Senior Seminar. But one files these things away
                    in one's memory and so, of course, when I was handed the telegram asking for the
                    agr�ment for Graham Martin, naturally all of this fluttered back into my memory.
                    My first reaction was, “Oh, Lord, what have I done to deserve this.”</p>
                <p>And in fact, of course, much of what the DCM in Bangkok said (Jim Wilson) turned
                    out to be true. The betting in Washington was about 99 to 1 that I would be out
                    on my ear within a very few days after Martin arrived there. But that didn't
                    turn out to be the case. I was there before Martin arrived, I was there during
                    his entire time and I was there after he left. We had a professional
                    relationship in which we each did our job. But he was an extremely difficult
                    person.</p>
                <p>More interesting perhaps than that is the political equations of that time. I
                    think I mentioned this previously - the view in Washington up until early '69
                    was that democracy in Italy would only really be consolidated if somehow the
                    Socialist Party, which in the immediate post-war period was so closely linked
                    with the Communists that we referred to the two parties as the Social
                    Communists, could be brought within the democratic majority. This meant that the
                    Christian Democrats, which was the largest party, at times had an absolute
                    majority but at other times it didn't and depended upon the fortunes, sometimes
                    rather low fortunes, of the three lay parties—the Social Democrats, the Liberals
                    and the Republicans—which were all very small parties, but which provided that
                    little bit that was necessary to give the Christian Democrats at least a working
                    majority in the parliament. The feeling was that the opening to the left, which
                    some people, of course, believed meant moving the Christian Democrats and
                    everybody towards the extreme left, whereas a lot of us, myself included,
                    thought that phrase meant opening the situation to a point where the Socialists
                    would be gradually brought into the democratic camp. You would have, thus, a
                    center/left government where the Socialists would become another version of the
                    Social Democrats.</p>
                <p>This had gradually taken place over a period of time and so when I went to Rome
                    we had that situation. Previously when I had been in Rome we had virtually no
                    contact with the Socialists, but now we did because they had become players
                    within the democratic arena. We extended, enlarged and improved our contacts
                    with the Italian Socialist Party. It was something that was also agreeable to
                    the Social Democrats with whom we had had a very close relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>But the Republicans took quite a different view of this thing. In September or
                    early October, 1969, before Graham Martin came but after Gardner Ackley had
                    left, I was for a period of time Charg� d'Affaires. John Volpe, who was then
                    Secretary of Transportation, came to Rome as local boy makes good. He originated
                    from the southeastern part of Italy. He came to Rome in a kind of triumph as
                    Secretary of Transportation. They gave him a medal and wined and dined him. He
                    was in seventh heaven. But he was very critical of the policy of the opening to
                    the left. He made it very clear that he didn't think that was the right policy
                    to follow. In his view he was also abetted by a man named Pierre Talenti, an
                    American of Italian origin who lived in Rome and was very wealthy. He had
                    somehow become the representative of the American Republican Party in Italy and
                    had early on in the Administration formed a linkage with the White House through
                    Al Haig, then deputy to Henry Kissinger, who was the National Security
                    Assistant.</p>
                <p>Talenti was quite right wing and he assumed a role in Rome with respect to US
                    policy, curiously enough an unofficial emissary. He was very critical of me
                    because he believed I was betraying the cause by supporting the notion of this
                    opening to the left.</p>
                <p>It turns out that Martin, who had not had an Embassy since Bangkok, he had been
                    in charge of the Alliance for Progress under Johnson which was an effort to
                    improve relationships with the other American republics, had persuaded the
                    powers that be that he was just the man, because he was tough as nails, to bring
                    about a shift in Italian politics and put things back on the track of
                    center/right and to remove the Socialist from their position of participation in
                    the government. He was given the mandate by Nixon apparently to go to Rome and
                    correct the situation. So that was the situation when he arrived at the end of
                    October, 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might just parenthetically say that there is an
                        interesting parallel for anybody who is studying this period. I was in
                        Athens about this time, 1970, and there was a man in Athens who more or less
                        had the same role your Talenti had, named Tom Messeri. He was of obvious
                        Greek origin. He was very close to at that point the dictatorship of the
                        colonels. He was in many ways also an unofficial emissary of the Republican
                        Party. I later served him a subpoena during the Watergate thing because of
                        this. This represents an interesting look at the Nixon foreign policy in
                        Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, I remember the name Tom Messeri, but I can't remember now what the
                    circumstances were. It may have been in connection with Athens, but...I guess
                    maybe it was because he was there for some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, he was there for a long time. He was extremely
                        powerful. Well, how did you deal with this situation—a difficult Ambassador
                        and you were following a policy which obviously was opposed by the
                        President?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>STABLER: Well, what happened, of course, was that Martin arrived and he made very
                    clear that that was what his mission was. But he had an unusual way of going
                    about these things. Rather typical of Martin was the fact that he arrived in
                    Italy on an Italian ship while American ships were still going in to Italy. But
                    he was able to wangle on medical grounds permission to travel on an Italian
                    ship. My wife and I went down to meet them. But he was not one given to easy
                    conversation, so what we did was to put them in their car and my wife and I in
                    our car. We didn't ride together. I was able to get up to the Villa Taverna,
                    where they were to live, before they arrived so I was there to greet them when
                    they came.</p>
                <p>To continue, his method of operation was to deal with relatively few people. On
                    the whole he more or less kept me informed of what was going on, although there
                    were instances when I was not. He controlled everything even to the point of how
                    had I allowed them to paint the fountains in front of the Chancery some color.
                    Actually I had not been consulted about it and made the mistake, for example, of
                    saying that I assumed he had given the approval. Well, he said I shouldn't
                    assume anything.</p>
                <p>My point is that he was so involved in certain details that I had every reason to
                    believe that they wouldn't have dared paint...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came from an administrative background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, he was the first person to receive the rank of Counselor for
                    Administration in Paris when he worked for Jefferson Caffery, and his one point
                    in life at that point was to make the Ambassador happy. With Caffery it was not
                    always easy. I am very fond of Jefferson Caffery who with his wife was actually
                    in Rome retired and living at the Grand Hotel at the time we speak. Martin was
                    something of a wheeler and dealer in that area and obviously did all sorts of
                    things which made the Ambassador's life in Paris comfortable, etc.</p>
                <p>So he was involved in minute details. But on the more important side, the
                    political side, he chose not to learn any Italian, he chose to have very little
                    really to do with the leaders of the political parties. The Secretary General of
                    the Christian Democratic Party, who is a person of great importance in Italy, he
                    chose to meet maybe once while he was there and that was in my house. He didn't
                    even want to ask him to the Residence. There was just the three of us and I did
                    the interpreting.</p>
                <p>He closed off lots of people to a point I found embarrassing because foreign
                    ambassadors would indeed ask me— “Are you in fact the ambassador? We think you
                    have an ambassador, we never see him, so we wonder if perhaps you really
                    are.”</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>He would chose certain people whom he thought had particular power in wheeling
                    and dealing basically. And amongst those were Pierre Talenti, whom I have spoken
                    about; Michele Sindona who was an Italian financier; General Miceli, who was the
                    head of the Italian counterpart to our CIA; and Archbishop Marcinkus, the
                    Vatican's banker. Of those people, Pierre Talenti was eventually forced to flee
                    Italy because of involvement in things he shouldn't have been involved in.
                    Sindona was ultimately arrested for financial speculation of one sort or another
                    and then committed suicide. Miceli was arrested and put in jail for illegal
                    activities. Archbishop Marcinkus was under all sorts of investigations as to
                    some of his dealings involving the Vatican's Bank.</p>
                <p>But these were all people who had at that time certain degrees of power. In the
                    case of Talenti, of course, because of his links with the White House, Martin
                    felt it desirable to get close enough to him in order to try to prevent him from
                    doing things behind Martin's back. The fact of the matter was that Martin
                    discovered he did do things behind his back in the White House, which of course
                    infuriated him.</p>
                <p>In connection with the elections, I'm jumping ahead but this is sort of the
                    overall picture I am trying to give you...in 1972 national elections were
                    held—previous to that there had been elections for the presidency which came out
                    all right. Then there were national parliamentary elections. At this point
                    Martin decided that although we had long since ceased to have any fiduciary
                    relationships with some of the political party (there had been from the
                    immediate post-war through the 60s a very large CIA program in Italy which had
                    come to an end), if he was going to give effect to the President's mandate, then
                    he must have a program.</p>
                <p>So he went back to Washington and received authority to commit up to ... I forget
                    the exact figure now but I would guess under $25 million program in Italy. He
                    was able to persuade those who dealt with these things in Washington to give him
                    the sole authority to handle the program. This, of course, was a great blow to
                    CIA which always under previous situations through their station chief had the
                    authority to make the final sign off with, of course, the approval of the
                    Ambassador. But in this instance the chief of station had nothing to say with
                    respect to the final sign off. That was to be done by the ambassador.</p>
                <p>So money was distributed around—quite a lot of it, I may say, going to General
                    Miceli, for whatever uses he felt he should put it to. As luck would have it,
                    and I say luck really in a way because I don't know that the program made all
                    that much difference really...as luck would have it the elections turned out in
                    a way that the majority could be formed by the center/right. In other words, the
                    Christian Democrats formed a government with the Liberals, the Republicans, and
                    the Social Democrats. The Socialists were out. Christian Democrat Andreotti
                    became Prime Minister. He was a person who some people believe was center/right.
                    Others thought that he played in whatever areas were necessary to give him the
                    Prime Ministry. He happened to be a very good friend of mine. I had known him
                    since the early 50's when I was in Rome the first time. He is a very astute
                    person.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is still at the very center of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: When I say I knew him in the 50's, he was influential in the early 50s
                    with de Gasperi and we are talking now almost 40 years ago ... he has played an
                    important role in Italian politics for 40 years in one form or another. He plays
                    the game of Italian politics. I have no doubt that all Italian politicians, no
                    matter what their stripe, have had dealings in parliament with the Communist
                    Party.</p>
                <p>In any event, Andreotti became Prime Minister and I am only amused by an incident
                    - there was an American sculptress in Rome who was a medalist making medallions,
                    plaques, etc. Under Andreotti's commission she had sculptured a little plaque
                    with the Trevi Fountain, one of the monuments of Rome. She struck it in gold and
                    silver and Andreotti would give these things to departing Ambassadors, etc. I
                    was pleased to note that when Martin left he was given the silver plaque, when I
                    left, Andreotti gave me a gold one.</p>
                <p>Just to finish that up, it wasn't very long thereafter that then the situation
                    reverted and that center/right government didn't last a very long time. By the
                    time Volpe came as Ambassador in January, 1973, very shortly thereafter the
                    thing moved back to the center/left, and ultimately, of course, an Italian
                    Socialist became Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little about where this money was distributed. You
                        mentioned this General Miceli. If I recall, he was involved with what
                        amounted to a rather right wing secret military intelligence organization,
                        or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I must say that developed more or less after I had left, but there was
                    the whole thing involving Masons, and I don't know what, a sort of secret group.
                    Some people were concerned that they might have been involved in trying to pull
                    off a coup d'etat or something of that sort. Actually while I was in Rome there
                    was a bungled effort by an Italian war hero of World War II, a former Naval
                    officer, Valerio Borghese, who had the Medaglia d'Oro which was the Italian
                    equivalent of our Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the one that blew up one of the ships in Alexandria
                        harbor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>STABLER: He may have been. He was very right wing. At one stage, maybe 1972, I
                    don't remember the date now, but we had wind of some plot, some coup
                    organization being put together. It was never very clear to me just exactly what
                    went on there. My recollection is that Pierre Talenti was involved in some way.
                    We, to my knowledge, were not, although Miceli probably knew about it. We also
                    had an Army Attach�, Clavio by name, who was very close to Martin, and who was
                    close to Miceli and acted as a conduit for Martin and Miceli. It is possible
                    that somehow information concerning this coup came through that channel. It may
                    have been one where these people were trying to involve the Embassy in it
                    because of what they believed to be Martin's right wing tendencies. That cast
                    some questions around as to what exactly we were up to. This never really
                    amounted to anything. The thing was discovered and people were arrested and it
                    came to nothing. But it did raise questions in one's mind as to what people like
                    Miceli and Talenti were up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find it interesting. Martin was not an Italian
                        expert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He apparently wasn't relying on his staff, including you,
                        to get briefed as well as one might.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, don't forget that he had sold himself on the basis that he could
                    change things around so he was going to do that irrespective. He had certain
                    people he listened to. He was not one who easily accepted advice when he thought
                    he was right - and he indicated to me more than once that he was most always
                    right in his judgments. He then moved ahead on this particular political line.
                    It was very difficult to argue with him on the subject because he was determined
                    that this was what he was going to do.</p>
                <p>He, of course, also devoted a lot of time to considering and dealing with matters
                    relating to US military presence in Italy. And I will say this for him, I
                    learned something from him which I found useful when I became an Ambassador.
                    That was how to deal with our military. They soon came to realize that they had
                    better not cross him. He played to the hilt the business of being the
                    President's personal representative. “You may be the military here and under the
                    command of European Command but as long as you are in Italy, I want to know what
                    you are doing and why you are doing it. I am the President's man.” This meant
                    that the military were frightened of him and therefore very clearly toed the
                    line when it came to doing things and would not go off the reservation in things
                    that might embarrass him.</p>
                <p>I found that very useful. I had a very large military presence in Spain and we on
                    the whole got along very well, but it was necessary to make clear basically to
                    them who was boss there.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>He really didn't see many Italians. I think much of what he understood about
                    Italian politics came to him ... of course he read the CIA stuff and also the
                    political reporting that was done by his staff and he approved it, etc.,
                    although it always conformed to his particular view of what he wanted to do. But
                    this business of being the personal representative of the President had a sort
                    of funny quirk in it too because he would ... for example, when he had a dinner
                    party, he would see to it that at the end of dinner he would leave the dining
                    room first before his guests as the President's personal representative. When
                    Secretary of State Rogers came to Rome the first time there was a little tiff
                    over who would sit on the right seat of the car. The Ambassador, believing that
                    as the President's personal representative he should sit on the right, and that
                    Rogers should sit on the left.</p>
                <p>This ultimately led to bad blood between the two to the extent that one evening
                    when Rogers was there for a NATO meeting - we had been up to the Villa Madama
                    which was the Italian Government's guest house, for a buffet supper and during
                    the supper Rogers came to me and said, “I thoroughly dislike buffets, can't we
                    go downtown, have dinner in an Italian restaurant.” I said, “Sure, just wait a
                    little longer to make your presence known and then you could leave.” He said,
                    “Well, that is fine. You make the reservations. I would like my wife and myself,
                    Marty and Faith Hillenbrand (Assistant Secretary for European Affairs), and you
                    and your wife.” I said, “Well, Mr. Secretary, that is fine but I find it a
                    little awkward because the Ambassador and Mrs. Martin are also at this reception
                    - it would be difficult for me to go off with you like this without inviting
                    them as well.” So with much reluctance he said, “Okay, you can ask them too.”
                    Eventually we left and got outside and the Secretary's car came up immediately,
                    but Martin's car was nowhere to be found. Finally Rogers said that my wife and I
                    should go with them and the Ambassador could follow. As we drove away I watched
                    the Ambassador standing their looking daggers. The next day Martin said, “I just
                    want you to know one thing. From now on, when the Rogers come to Rome you and
                    Emily will look after them. I will have nothing to do with them.” So that was
                    what happened.</p>
                <p>What this really meant was that Martin had decided that in the power equation he
                    would throw his lot in completely with Kissinger, who was then National Security
                    Assistant to Nixon, and there was a constant back channel flow between him and
                    Kissinger. He basically simply ignored Rogers. The Rogers thoroughly disliked
                    the Martins and that was reciprocated. When the Rogers did come to Rome, my wife
                    and I would look after them and go out to dinner with them or whatever. It was a
                    very weird situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These insights to some of the people who rose during the
                        Nixon Administration are very interesting, but what do you attribute this
                        almost unerring focus on this sort of nasty lot of people as his closest
                        advisors on the Italian scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>STABLER: Let's look at it from a different point of view. He had this mandate to
                    change the focus from the center/left to center/right. Who are the important
                    players in this development? Who exercise certain levers of power from outside
                    the strictly orthodox political parties? Money talked big—Sindona. Covert action
                    of one sort or another—Miceli. The Vatican, although the Vatican by then had
                    very little influence on what was going on politically, but still they had a
                    traditional role—here was an American Archbishop close to the Pope, the Vatican
                    Bank. Then there was this other element which was not really power structure so
                    much as it was the containment of Pierre Talenti who had certain political
                    relations in Italy with right wingers.</p>
                <p>It was these sort of levers that he regarded as important in manipulating what
                    was going on. All spoke English except Miceli which is why Army Attach Clavio
                    was useful because he was his sort of contact, interpreter, what not with
                    Miceli—he was the conduit really to Miceli. So he looked around and sought what
                    he thought were major levers of power-moving and that is why I think he
                    established these particular contacts.</p>
                <p>Obviously there were others he knew, but to my knowledge there was no particular
                    effort to meet with a lot of these Italian political people to give the word, so
                    to speak. They hardy knew him. I can't tell you, because I don't know, whether
                    for example in Bangkok this was his way of doing business there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently when he was in Saigon this was more or less his
                        way of operating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Probably so. He was not an outgoing individual. He said that he must
                    conserve his energy and not waste his time. This was true of a number of things.
                    Some time after he came I thought it would be nice to give a dinner for them to
                    have some fairly senior Italians that he ought to meet. He said he would be
                    willing to do it. Then I put together a list and sent it in for his approval.
                    Nothing happened. Finally one day he came to my office and asked if he really
                    had to do this. I said that it was entirely up to him. He said he had to
                    conserve his energy and didn't want to do it. And that was the end of that.</p>
                <p>There was this constant business of not wanting to deal with people who were in
                    the power structure of Italian political life. But that was not the way of his
                    dealing with things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you survive with him? You already had your
                        contacts, you spoke Italian. Italian politicians do reach out and want to
                        keep in contact. This so often breeds tremendous tension between the DCM who
                        knows everybody and an ambassador who doesn't. I am surprised you were able
                        to survive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think that he found that I was useful to him because I could do
                    that—see people and report to him what they were saying, etc. I wasn't
                    threatening him because he didn't want to do that. I obviously had to keep him
                    very closely informed of what I did because anything that I did and didn't tell
                    him about made him quite angry. And we had our run ins at various times.
                    Something came up once involving my wife and Mrs. Martin. I don't know, she
                    chose to take something wrong and I finally went in to him and said, “Obviously
                    if it is your belief that we are willfully trying to insult Mrs. Martin then the
                    best thing to do is to ask for my transfer because if that is the way you view
                    it, we obviously can't survive.” Well, that passed over, there was no problem.
                    There was little or no social exchange between us. He had as his
                    Political-Military Counselor a young fellow who had worked for him in Bangkok
                    and who he had been brought to Rome. Martin and his wife saw a lot of them. This
                    sounds perhaps slightly immodest, but he also had some respect for my
                    professionalism and for the fact that I didn't let grass grow under my feet and
                    that I had a good relationship with the staff and could deal with them—because
                    he didn't want to, although he wanted to know everything that was going on. He
                    was totally involved with the Administrative Counselor because all of that area
                    he loved. So I suppose one survived because I filled a gap of things that he
                    didn't want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the staff of the Embassy, particularly political
                        and economical reporters? Did you have a hard time keeping them to the task
                        because they felt that there was a barrier between them and the ambassador,
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Not really. They would go ahead and do their reporting. It was something
                    that he frequently looked at. He wanted to know what was going on. I don't fault
                    him in that respect at all. I had to make the decision of what I would sign and
                    what I would send on to him. Certainly I sent more on to him than not because I,
                    myself, felt that since it was going out under his name and he was intensely
                    interested in what was going on, both economic and political side, and
                    particularly on the military side he should see them. We had a lot going on.
                    Trying to sell things to the Italians, problems involving Italians selling
                    American equipment to third parties, that type of activities interested him.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>We did all sorts of strange things. I remember one particular instance and some
                    question about some military hardware of the Italians. He had to go home to the
                    States and it was important that something be done at a certain time so he then
                    authorized me to deal with it and actually sign his name to it even thought he
                    wasn't in the country. We did things like that. He had clearly a certain
                    confidence in me. It was a strange relationship, but it was a professional one.
                    And while I have to tell you that I used to deplore suffering the things that he
                    did under that rubric, he was the Ambassador and I found no particular reason
                    during the time I was there to feel that I simply couldn't accept what the
                    policy was. I mean, if that was what the Administration felt they wanted done, I
                    didn't feel that the national interests of the United States was so threatened
                    by that that I couldn't accept it. The center/right was a perfectly acceptable
                    formula because it was a democratic formula too, so there was nothing wrong with
                    that. What was wrong was only a question of nuance there as to whether you
                    wanted to enlarge the area of democracy and as to whether the Socialists would
                    provide that enlargement in a perfectly safe way. There was a disagreement of
                    view on that, but it was not a question of major adverse effect on national
                    interest.</p>
                <p>So we had a working relationship. It was strained though, because at the end,
                    when he left, in the latter part of 1972, although he made such a point about
                    administration, he was extraordinarily neglectful of things like efficiency
                    reports. When he left he didn't do one on me. Finally the State Department got
                    after him. I was in the States, I had come home, and he was in the States. He
                    called me up and said, “Why don't you just write your efficiency report and send
                    it to me and I will sign it.” “Well,” I said, “Mr. Ambassador I will think it
                    over.” I wrote to him and said, “I attach great importance to the efficiency
                    report system and have spent a lot of time over the years during all the reports
                    I have had to do. I think it is something that one just has to take seriously. I
                    am sorry but I simply cannot accept the notion of my writing my own report. If
                    you feel you do not want to write one, or don't have time to write one, that is
                    up to you. But I am not going to do it.” And eventually he did, and it was quite
                    a good one.</p>
                <p>Again he got the job in Saigon because he threw his lot in with Kissinger.
                    Kissinger told me later, after the whole Saigon thing was over, that he had
                    intended at one point to make Martin the Deputy Secretary of State. But he said
                    he was glad he didn't because he was clearly a sort of a psychotic case. That
                    was after the whole business of his leaving Saigon.</p>
                <p>Those four years that I had in Rome ... I had a short time with Ackley and then
                    three years with Martin and then a bare three months with Volpe. During the time
                    that Volpe was there I really spent most of my time helping him through the
                    early days and then writing efficiency reports, so I really didn't get much
                    involved in the Volpe administration which had become rather strained in a way
                    because he had brought with him a political appointee as a special assistant who
                    rapidly began playing almost the role of DCM and who was given the apartment
                    usually reserved the Consul General in the apartment house where the Minister,
                    the Political Counselor, the Economic Counselor and the Consul General
                    traditionally lived. So I really don't have much to say on the Volpe period
                    because I wasn't there that long.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>All things considered, I suppose one can't say that Martin did irreparable harm
                    to the US-Italian relations. One can't say, I don't think, that he did them much
                    good either. It was a role of the power behind the throne type of operation. He
                    certainly was activist in the sense that he was trying specifically to coax a
                    political move in the direction opposite to which the situation had been moving.
                    But, as I said before, not one which had any real consequences for US interests
                    one way or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last look at this period. The United States was
                        tremendously involved with Vietnam at the time, but also we were trying to
                        change our relationship with the Soviet Union and there was the opening to
                        China too at the time. Were the Italians pretty much along with us on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: On China, again I am a little hazy on the dates, but it seems to me that
                    most of the question as to the business of what the Italians would do with
                    regard to Mainland China occurred during the time I was Charg� d'Affaires. I
                    made a big, but what I knew would be a losing effort to persuade the Italians
                    not to recognize Communist China. Other countries had already done so, the
                    British and even the French by then. As long as the Italians had the comfort in
                    numbers it was fairly clear that they were going to do it too, although we did
                    make a valiant effort. I went to see as many people as I could on the subject,
                    but I recognize that they did not think, in light of the recognition by other
                    countries friendly to the United States, that their recognition was going to
                    cause them any serious damage when it came to relations with the United States.
                    And they were quite correct in so believing.</p>
                <p>That really was a major question at that time. They had, of course, quite good
                    relations with the Soviet Union. Obviously the Communist Party was quite
                    important at that time. I think it reached the largest percentage of the vote at
                    that time—close to 23 percent. It was frighteningly large. So that had to be
                    taken into account. Although, of course, in that period of time the Communists
                    were, even though their vote was large, less of a threat because they had
                    changed their spots to some extent from where they had been in the 50's as a
                    result of what had happened in Hungary and then Czechoslovakia. All these
                    incidents had had an effect on the Communist Party, but in terms of percentages
                    it was way up there. Obviously the United States' policy continued to be aimed
                    at trying to cut back the influence of the Communist Party. But this wasn't an
                    easy thing to do because some of the best-administered cities in Italy were
                    communist-administered—Bologna...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Florence was one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Florence had a Socialist mayor, but he had become more respectable. But
                    these cities were very well administered.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>We had a very low key relationship with the Communist Party. Junior political
                    officers had contacts with the Party. I personally met the Secretary of the
                    Communist Party, Berlinguer, one evening at the National Day of Hungary. The
                    Hungarian Ambassador asked me if I would mind meeting Berlinguer, and I said I
                    had no problem. So we exchanged a few words. Very shortly thereafter the
                    Hungarian Ambassador defected. He re-defected some time later.</p>
                <p>I can't think of any other major things during that time. It was a strange
                    period. I was never totally comfortable because one never quite knew just
                    exactly which way Martin was going to spring in terms of personal things too. He
                    had a habit of coming into my office and if I was on the phone he would go to my
                    extension line, put his fingers to his lips and pick up my extension phone and
                    listen to my conversation with whomever it happened to be. This at times was
                    awkward because there were times, at least once or twice, when the person on the
                    line was saying not very complimentary things about Martin and somehow I had to
                    get him off the subject. He considered that to be his absolute right to know
                    what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't help but every time Martin comes up I get the
                        impression of the Spider King—the former king of France—lurking around the
                        corridors and listening in at key holes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There was a certain degree of that, but he didn't put an extension of my
                    line in his office so he could listen without my knowing—at least I wasn't aware
                    of such an extension. But he wanted to know what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this time you say the CIA station chief was put out
                        because he couldn't control this somewhat less than $25 million that was
                        being distributed by this rather peculiar crew of Italians...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No, don't misunderstand me. A certain amount, I can't remember how much,
                    was given in a lump sum to Miceli. The others had no role in it—Sindona and
                    Marcinkus. Talenti had no role in that although I am sure that he knew about the
                    program. To what extent he may have been consulted about it, I don't know. But a
                    considerable sum was given to Miceli to be used as he saw fit in trying to
                    influence...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what was the relationship with the CIA and Martin? I
                        would have thought Martin would have found almost a blood brother in the
                        CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>STABLER: But his point was that “I am the Ambassador and I am not going to have a
                    subordinate decide where this money is going to go. I am the President's
                    personal representative and I am not going to have them do something and not
                    show me what they have done.” As you know, that is one of the great problems. If
                    they had had the authority that they normally have they could have decided to
                    give a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand to somebody, report it back to
                    Washington as an operational matter and wouldn't have had to show the message to
                    the Ambassador.What we would do, and I would attend some, if not all, of the
                    meetings, would be to meet in the back room with the Ambassador, myself and the
                    station chief. The Ambassador would decide that he wanted this done and that
                    done. Some was given to the parties, some to individuals. Sometimes the station
                    chief or myself would recommend something, but it was the Ambassador who would
                    give the approval. It was not the station chief who said what we were going to
                    do. The Ambassador directed it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on Italy. When you were there how were
                        our consulates viewed? I am speaking as a former Consul General in Naples.
                        Often you had the feeling that Rome was considered inside the Beltway. There
                        was this wonderful game going on of political switching back and forth, but
                        it really had no pertinence to anything outside of Rome. There wasn't much
                        real contact between the consulates and Rome. How did Martin feel about the
                        consulates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, he took considerable interest in the consulates. For example, he
                    fought very hard to keep Trieste and Turin going. He won those battles. You had
                    Homer Byington in Naples, sort of his fiefdom really. There wasn't a great deal
                    of exchange there. I would go down every so often. Was Outerbridge Horsey still
                    in Palermo? I am not sure. Bob Gordon went up to Florence. I can't remember who
                    was up in Milan. A short fellow.</p>
                <p>One of the problems, as Italian used to call them, was the political games - and
                    that was what all this business was about - the constant shifting around of
                    coalitions and cabinets and prime ministers—they were political games that were
                    played mostly in Rome. The rest of the country didn't seem terribly interested
                    in what was going on. They had their own political games in their regions. So
                    therefore the consulates were somewhat limited in the sort of information they
                    could produce which would really make much difference with respect to the
                    overall assessment of the political situation as seen from Rome.</p>
                <p>Their economic reporting was more useful. Every so often the consuls did come
                    down. Martin was basically rather supportive of the consulates. He thought they
                    had a role to play beyond just the role of purely consular work, which was
                    important in itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>But he also had rather a curious view, and I think I may have mentioned this to
                    you. The Consul General in Rome was Jack Kuhn and he had been on the consular
                    side of things for quite a number of years. I thought that he had done a good
                    job in Rome in running the consulate which was a big one, keeping everybody
                    happy and being on top of what was going on, and providing the services that
                    were required and in such a way that brought credit to the US. He was an FSO-2.
                    I wrote an efficiency report on him which was a very good one and which made the
                    point that this fellow had been in important consular positions and that he
                    merited on the basis of his performance a promotion to Class-1. My feeling very
                    strongly being that if you are in that work, it is important work, it should be
                    recognized. The chances of him going beyond that were slight, but he should be
                    recognized for what he had done.</p>
                <p>Martin in effect said in his reviewing officer report that it would seem too bad
                    to deny to a political officer promotion to class-1 through giving it to this
                    fellow. What could one say. I didn't agree with him, but that was his report and
                    I couldn't do anything about it. I thought that was entirely wrong because I
                    think that the people who do the consular work should be encouraged in every way
                    possible and the only way we have to do it is through promotions. But Martin
                    took a different view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Rome in 1973. When in 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Walter Stoessel, who had, I think, been named Assistant Secretary for
                    European Affairs, came to Rome, it seems to me, in early 1973 or late 1972. He
                    asked whether I would be interested in going back to Washington as one of his
                    deputies—Deputy Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. That was a good job so
                    I agreed with appreciation. So we left, I think it was in March of 1973, just
                    short of four years, and came back to Washington. I became Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary with responsibility for Western Europe. I was the number three, I
                    guess. George Springsteen was the principal deputy and Jack Armitage for Soviet
                    Affairs. I can't remember who was deputy for NATO and things of that sort, but
                    maybe it was George Springsteen who did that.</p>
                <p>That was fairly routine. One of my first jobs was in connection with the visit of
                    the Italian Prime Minister, Andreotti, who came with his wife. We went to
                    various things for him, because Rogers was still Secretary at that point. I
                    don't remember during that period any particularly outstanding issues that came
                    up. It was all fairly routine.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Then Kissinger became Secretary of State in the fall of 1973, if I remember
                    correctly, or the summer of 1973. It wasn't so very long after that that
                    Kissinger decided he wanted to make a change. He wanted a younger, perhaps a
                    slightly more dynamic person. I was very fond of Walter Stoessel and a very
                    great friend so I don't say this in any derogatory fashion, but Walter had a
                    very low key style, you know, and Kissinger liked him because he had him made
                    Ambassador to the Soviet Union. However, Larry Eagleburger was quite
                    instrumental, I think, in pointing Kissinger towards Arthur Hartman, who was
                    then DCM at our Mission to the Common Market to be Assistant Secretary of State
                    for European Affairs. So Arthur came back to that and the betting was about
                    90-10 that I would not last very long with him. That was also proven not to be
                    true because eventually I became his principal deputy.</p>
                <p>I continued as Deputy Assistant Secretary until maybe a month or so after Arthur
                    took over at which point George Springsteen left to become Executive Secretary
                    at the State Department. Arthur then appointed me as his principal deputy. There
                    weren't any things particularly overwhelming until, I guess April of 1974 when
                    the Portuguese revolution took place. I had a great deal to do with the various
                    discussions on it and was in large measure responsible for at least proposing to
                    Kissinger that Frank Carlucci be made Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard this from some other interviews that on the
                        Portuguese revolution there was some unhappiness with the team we had there
                        which just was not responding.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think the Ambassador's name was Scott. A very nice gentleman who was,
                    I think, in his early seventies, and who was a lawyer in New York and who had
                    been a law partner of Tom Dewey. The President, with the acceptance of Rogers,
                    had appointed him as the Legal Adviser of the State Department. He had not yet
                    taken up his position when Kissinger was named Secretary of State. Kissinger
                    wanted his own Legal Adviser who happened to be his own attorney in New York,
                    Carlisle Maw, who is now dead. Therefore something had to be for Mr. Scott and
                    he was offered what was considered to be the pleasant, not terribly
                    controversial Portugal, although somewhat difficult because of our relations of
                    Portugal over their African territories...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And our ties with the Azores which always...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>STABLER: But Portugal was a member of NATO and so long as they were in NATO the
                    Azores and so forth fell under that umbrella. But the more difficult subject was
                    their attitude in the UN on their colonies in Africa. But it was felt that
                    Scott, and whoever his deputy was, could handle it without a problem. But then
                    the revolution took place. Salazar had already gone and Caetano had taken over
                    as a dictator. Then the troops came back from some of the African colonies and
                    they were the ones who mounted this coup. I remember calling Mr. Scott one day
                    and saying that we hadn't really heard what was going on. He said, “Well, I
                    don't quite really know yet. I can't read the newspapers and no one yet has
                    reported to me what is happening.” There was the element of possible Communist
                    involvement in this thing and we felt that this was too ticklish a situation to
                    leave in basically amateur hands. The staff didn't seem quite capable of dealing
                    with it or lighting a fire under the Ambassador. So it was determined that we
                    really had to make a change. The question then was who? So I had the
                    Department's personnel people run off a computer check of senior officers,
                    FSO-1s or above, who spoke Portuguese. Of course, Frank Carlucci's name popped
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had served in Brazil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, and he had been under fire in the Congo. He spoke Portuguese. At
                    that point he was Deputy Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and it was
                    understood that he wanted to make a change. So this was put up to Kissinger and
                    he agreed that he was probably the right man. So in point of fact ... let me
                    think, my timing seems to be off here because this happened in 1974 but Carlucci
                    went to Portugal some time later. He went to Portugal not a very long time
                    before I went to Madrid and I went to Madrid in March 1975. I think what we did
                    was to recall...I think he must have gone there sooner. We recalled Scott, but
                    then the great question came up as to what you do about the Portuguese
                    Socialists. Kissinger was a man, and this goes back a little bit to the Italian
                    days, who was very leery of Socialists. He may well have had that influence on
                    Nixon over the Italian Socialists. When I went to Madrid he had a bit of a thing
                    about the Spanish Socialists until I explained to him what that was all about.
                    And this was what Carlucci did when he finally persuaded Kissinger that we had
                    to recognize that the Portuguese Socialists were not in bed with the Communists
                    - they were really Social Democrats and that we ought to work with them, help,
                    and support them. The Socialist leader, Mario Soares came over here as did some
                    of the other democratic people and greatly helped their cause.</p>
                <p>After some tough exchanges Kissinger finally agreed that we ought to pursue the
                    policy of supporting the Socialists, which was absolutely the right thing to
                    have done. But it was Carlucci, really, who persuaded Kissinger to go along, and
                    Carlucci's judgment turned out to be absolutely on the mark.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I understood was that it took a strong man like
                        Carlucci to really stand up to Kissinger on this initially. This was one of
                        those cases where it was the Ambassador on the spot who really made a
                        difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think that is absolutely true and I think this was one of the things
                    with Kissinger that if you stood your ground and believed you were right and
                    were persuasive in your presentation and wouldn't permit yourself to be
                    brow-beaten by him, he would listen to you and respect your judgment. This was
                    what happened to Carlucci. He didn't go down under the first onslaught from
                    Kissinger who was very quick to put people down. He hadn't been in the
                    Department terribly long and had not had, before coming into the Department, a
                    very favorable view of Foreign Service people anyway. So I think one would say
                    that there was no doubt that Carlucci was largely responsible for saving the day
                    for us in Portugal.</p>
                <p>That was in April/May/June period of 1974. Then in July of '74 ... to go back a
                    bit, some time in the spring of 1974 Kissinger had decided that he didn't see
                    why when he traveled through NATO areas he had to have the Assistant Secretary
                    for European Affairs, and the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs,
                    particularly when he went to Greece and Turkey, travel with him. Why couldn't
                    all these countries be under one Assistant Secretary? So in May, or perhaps
                    June, of 1974 he decreed that in the future Greece, Turkey and Cyprus would
                    become part of the Bureau of European Affairs. They fell to my lot as countries
                    of Western Europe.</p>
                <p>Then in July, 1974, the Greek military undertook a coup against Archbishop
                    Makarios, the President of Cyprus. The Greek colonels, of course, were involved.
                    There was a strong body among the Greek military who thought that there should
                    be a union between Cyprus and Greece, Enosis and that Makarios was not
                    furthering this aim and therefore should be deposed. In the morning hours, of
                    whatever day in July it was, the Greek military staged this coup and Makarios
                    was forced to flee.</p>
                <p>Normally that would have been something that the Assistant Secretary for European
                    Affairs would have been called upon to go to Kissinger's office and discuss the
                    implications and possible policy steps. It just so happened that on that
                    particular day Arthur Hartman had had a long standing engagement to meet and
                    negotiate with a team from East Germany on the conditions for recognition of
                    East Germany by the United States and the establishment of diplomatic relations.
                    It was not something in which I had been involved and therefore he felt that he
                    absolutely should do that. I, therefore, should be the one to deal with the
                    Cyprus problem and go to see Kissinger. That actually was the first time that I
                    had had any contact with Kissinger. This was the beginning of that long period
                    of dealing with Cyprus, the relationship with Kissinger, and ultimately the
                    appointment to Spain.</p>

                <p>
                    <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is July 19, 1991 and this is the continuing
                        interview with Ambassador Wells Stabler. Mr. Ambassador I would like to
                        start with the situation that blew up in July of 1974 with Cyprus. European
                        Affairs had just absorbed Greece and Turkey in April and all of a sudden you
                        are faced with a major problem with two NATO allies pointing guns at each
                        other. Could you describe how this hit you and some of the personnel in the
                        Washington area when you heard about this Cyprus business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. It was about in April of 1974 that Secretary Kissinger decided that
                    he didn't see why he had to have two Assistant Secretaries traveling with him
                    when he went to NATO conferences—Greece and Turkey were under the Near Eastern
                    Affairs. So he made a decision to transfer Greece, Turkey and Cyprus to the
                    jurisdiction of the Bureau of European Affairs. Very few of us at that time in
                    EUR had a great deal of knowledge of what was going on in Greece and Turkey,
                    except as it related to NATO matters. The regional questions were, of course,
                    not dealt with by the Bureau of European Affairs. So this was somewhat of a
                    surprise. The officers handling Greek and Turkish Affairs in NEA came into EUR
                    and it fell to me as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for European Affairs who
                    mostly handled Western and Central European Affairs, to take on Greece, Turkey
                    and Cyprus.</p>
                <p>It was all relatively calm and no one thought a great deal about problems that
                    might come about as a result of this. Although the reasons for the coup had been
                    bubbling up for a number of years there was no particular crisis at the time. At
                    any event, in July, 1974 the Greek military, with the Colonels in charge in
                    Athens, decided that the time had come to carry out the policy of enosis which
                    was uniting Cyprus with Greece. They mounted a coup in Nicosia which was aimed
                    at Archbishop Makarios. He was forced to flee and a major crisis suddenly
                    presented itself. This was putting the heat on as far as Greek and Turkish
                    relations were concerned.</p>
                <p>Normally in a situation of this sort the Assistant Secretary of European Affairs
                    would have handled the matter directly with Kissinger who, of course, was much
                    concerned about this as it related to two important NATO allies. But Arthur
                    Hartman had had a long standing engagement to negotiate with a delegation from
                    East Germany on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United
                    States and East Germany. This delegation had come especially from East Germany
                    for this. Arthur felt that he had to meet this particular engagement. It was not
                    one that I as his principal deputy could have easily taken over because I had
                    not been involved in the earlier discussions leading up to the negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>So he then asked me to go up and deal with Cyprus with Kissinger, whom I hadn't
                    dealt with before. I went up and from that day forward until I left EUR to get
                    ready to go to Spain, I saw Kissinger many times a day, traveled with him as far
                    as India to be with him to deal with the Cyprus question. He, of course, was
                    very troubled by all of this, recognizing that this was going to upset the Turks
                    and that we would soon have a Turkish reaction...which indeed we did.The Turkish
                    army very shortly thereafter invaded the northern part of Cyprus and annexed
                    that part of Cyprus that had predominantly Turkish population...as well as some
                    areas that had a large Greek population. It was quite clear that this could lead
                    to a very serious confrontation between Greeks and Turks not only on Cyprus but
                    on the mainland as well.</p>
                <p>So he set about trying to calm the waters and to restore some semblance of peace
                    in the area. This was not an easy thing to do at all because the animosity
                    between Greeks and Turks was such that it was almost impossible to get any
                    moderation, plus the fact that we had the junta, the Colonels...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually I think it was the Generals by that time. The
                        Colonels had been overthrown by their Generals. It was still a pretty inept
                        crew.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I guess they were still called the Colonels...</p>
                <p>In any event, this was a crisis that started in July and continued with great
                    intensity throughout the summer and into the winter months. A great deal of
                    effort was put in to this business, trying to appeal to the Greeks and then to
                    the Turks to calm the situation down.</p>
                <p>Now Secretary Kissinger had, as you remember, taught one time at Harvard and had
                    a seminar for a variety of up and coming political leaders. He felt that this
                    gave him a special bond. Prime Minister Ecevit of Turkey had attended his
                    seminar at Cambridge. Thus there was a relatively easy access channel. The Greek
                    situation was really quite different, because it seems to me that sometime in
                    the period from July to the fall, the Generals had been toppled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they were. The leader, although he never had the
                        official name, was a man named Ioannidis who was sort of the military
                        policeman—a very, very difficult character. During the summer, because the
                        coup instigated by the Colonels had brought such a disaster on the Greek
                        cause, the Colonels were put out and Karamanlis came out of exile and formed
                        a government, a democratic government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, I remember that because the access to Ecevit was a very easy one,
                    the access to Karamanlis was not an easy one. He didn't speak English and
                    Kissinger had a predilection for calling these people on the telephone. Ecevit
                    he could talk with but with Karamanlis he really couldn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>[Former King Constantine of Greece became a friend of ours when we were in Rome
                    and he was in exile there. I used to see him there from time to time. ( I also
                    saw him every so often in Madrid. He was the brother-in-law of King Juan Carlos,
                    whose wife, Queen Sofia, was Constantine's sister.) He always told me that he
                    felt that Karamanlis had betrayed him. He had talked to Karamanlis when he was
                    in exile in Paris and understood that if Karamanlis was ever restored he would
                    bring about the restoration of the monarchy. He had expected a call from
                    Karamanlis when he got back to Athens, which never came.]</p>
                <p>Both the Greeks and Turks were very unbending in this whole thing. The situation
                    was compounded later, after the July landing of the Turks, when the Turks felt
                    threatened again and landed additional troops on Cyprus which then really tore
                    things apart because the Greek lobby in Congress was extremely strong. There was
                    no Turkish lobby but a strong Greek lobby with Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and
                    John Brademas of Indiana and a number of others who were very, very active. They
                    then started a campaign in Congress to cut off military aid to Turkey on the
                    grounds that US equipment had been used for other than NATO purposes which would
                    require specific consent of the United States government. The Greeks felt that
                    Kissinger had misled them and his relations with Congress over this became very
                    intense.</p>
                <p>As a result of all this, you may recall, an arms embargo was placed on
                    Turkey—this being '74 or early '75—and wasn't lift until the fall of 1978. This,
                    of course, seriously hampered our relations with Turkey.</p>
                <p>In any event, during this period, I was constantly in Kissinger's office. Of
                    course, Art Hartman and others came into it too. There was Bob McCloskey who was
                    special assistant to Kissinger at that time and was there a great deal of the
                    time. Bill Casey, Under Secretary of Economic Affairs, was in and out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: There were a number of people involved, but I really basically became
                    the coordinator of the Cyprus situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some other interviews that I have done and am doing—I
                        am picking up some of the people who were either the Turkish Desk Officer or
                        the Greek Desk Officer or the Cyprus Desk Officer. One of the minor legends
                        of the Foreign Service is the clash between Tom Boyatt, who was a rather
                        junior but a very outspoken officer who was the Cypriot Desk Officer, and
                        Henry Kissinger. More than just that, I wonder if you could give an idea of
                        Kissinger's reaction to this? Did he see this as an East-West problem that
                        was screwing up the NATO works, or born in Europe did he see this as almost
                        one of those tribal animosities or did he understand... How did he relate to
                        the expertise in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think his main concern at the outset was the fact that it was a clash
                    between two NATO allies, thus disturbing the tranquility of the Eastern
                    Mediterranean at a time when we were still thoroughly engaged in the business of
                    the Soviet Union being our principal enemy. You have the Turks and to a lesser
                    extent the Greeks, looking elsewhere than NATO and this was a concern to him.
                    Basically the context of the East-West relationship became a serious matter. It
                    didn't really have many overtones with respect to his other great interests—the
                    Middle East. It didn't spill over very much into the Arab-Israel problem. So it
                    really was a question of these people not focusing on their principal
                    responsibility and that was what we had to deal with.</p>
                <p>Of course, the British were much involved too because of their own situation in
                    Cyprus. They have a major air base there which was important. Various noises
                    were made by the Greeks of possibly closing that in annoyance over the attitude
                    of the British who were totally opposed to what the Greeks had done.</p>
                <p>That is why he spent as much time as he did on it, trying to find a way to bring
                    equilibrium back into the area and get the Greeks and Turks thinking about NATO
                    and their responsibilities rather than fighting each other. This I think was his
                    principal point.</p>
                <p>There certainly was a clash with Tom Boyatt, but I honestly can't remember all
                    the details now. Boyatt was ultimately removed. But there were a lot of people
                    involved in the clash. It got to the point where Kissinger believed that
                    Ambassador Tasca in Athens was nothing more than a spokesman for the junta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Tasca had been Ambassador there from about
                        1970-1974. He was sent by Nixon to try to work with the junta. He saw a lot
                        of Papadopoulos, Pattakos, Ioannidis and the others trying to work with
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>STABLER: But this became really something in which Kissinger believed—that Tasca
                    was in fact not a great deal more than the spokesman for the junta—to the extent
                    that there really was no communication between the Secretary of State and the
                    Ambassador in Athens. It was done largely with Monty Stearns, the DCM. When I
                    was sent out to talk with Ecevit in Ankara and the Foreign Minister or some
                    other official in Athens, I stayed with Monty. I knew Tasca, we had been in Rome
                    together, but I didn't see him at that point. He was holed up in the Residence
                    and in effect I was advised not to see him as he was on his way out. Kissinger
                    was determined to get rid of him as quickly as he possibly could and did. He
                    sent Jack Kubisch there as the Ambassador. So Tasca, also, was one of those who
                    fell in this situation.</p>
                <p>Bob Dillon was the Turkish Officer and for whom I have the greatest admiration
                    and liking. I worked very closely with Bob. It seems curious that I can't
                    remember now who the Greek Desk Officer was at the time. But I just don't.I'm a
                    little confused now because there was what they used to call Greek-Turkish
                    Affairs...I don't know if there was an office and then separate desk officers or
                    not. Bob Dillon certainly did Turkish Affairs and there must have been somebody
                    else who did Greek Affairs. Ultimately Bob left and Bill Eagleton came in as the
                    Office Director.</p>
                <p>The fact was, I suppose I could say, that even though I was Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, I in effect became the Desk Officers for Greece, Turkey and Cyprus at
                    the time. It was curious. Kissinger had very strong views about all these
                    things. He was apt to decide exactly how he wanted to play something and it
                    often fell to me to put it into words for him, make changes that I thought
                    should be done.</p>
                <p>At the very outset, Joe Sisco, Under Secretary for Political Affairs, was
                    dispatched almost immediately to the area as Kissinger's emissary to see what he
                    could do to patch the thing up. He came back basically empty handed. Then in due
                    course other emissaries were sent, including Art Hartman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall in one interview with Bob Dillon saying they sat
                        in the plane in Ankara and they didn't know where to go. Things were falling
                        apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, I remember that. They weren't really quite sure what came next.
                    That was put together almost immediately so it wasn't really clear what it was
                    they were expected to do except to try to calm the situation down as quickly as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>I know that when Arthur Hartman went over on a mission and reported back what he
                    had done, Kissinger went up in smoke because Hartman had apparently not said
                    exactly what Kissinger had told him to say.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I was sent out and remember going one Sunday afternoon to a house on Nebraska
                    Avenue that belonged to Wiley Buchanan, who had been Chief of Protocol. He used
                    to lend Kissinger his house in the summer when the Buchanans went up to their
                    house in Newport. I went over there and we went over exactly what I was to say
                    to Ecevit and to the Greeks. I must say on the plane over I carefully noted down
                    exactly what it was that he wanted me to say, which I did. I reported back
                    practically verbatim what I had said, and of course what had been said to me.
                    This made him happy because he felt his instructions had been carried out to the
                    letter.</p>
                <p>All of these things really...it was a constant sort of dialogue but with the
                    attitude in Congress, which was really in favor of the Greek situation, and the
                    Turks clearly having no intention of giving up their military occupation of a
                    certain part of Cyprus, nothing really could be achieved. Certainly the
                    government of Karamanlis was more disposed to reason than the junta, but the
                    Turks were in occupation and by this time Makarios had been restored. Clerides
                    who was the leader of the Greek community in Cyprus and Denktash, the leader of
                    the Turkish community, would have talks. And there were talks in Geneva. There
                    were talks everywhere. But no one could find any solution beyond basically what
                    has now become the status quo. The Turks, of course, declared the independent
                    Turkish Republic of Cyprus, which no one recognizes, except them.</p>
                <p>We had great tragedies there because of the Cypriot population's view that we
                    favored the Turks in some way. There would be demonstrations and you remember
                    the tragic killing of Rodger Davies who was our Ambassador there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was killed by Cypriot police, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I don't remember now exactly how that happened. It was one of those
                    tragic things where the mob stormed the Embassy shooting and he was
                    unfortunately a victim of it. I would guess that today the situation is largely
                    what it was a number of years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little of the thinking at the time. You had two mixed
                        populations on the island, the Greeks and the Turks, and things weren't
                        going well. They were shooting at each other and it was all mixed up and the
                        fact that there had been essentially an exchange of population and there was
                        a clear demarcation between what was under Turkish control and what was
                        under Greek control. Was anyone saying, “Well, you know this is a bad spot
                        to get over, but in the long run it is going to be a lot better than having
                        these two people living cheek to jowl and really not being very nice to each
                        other.” Were you getting any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>STABLER: There was a certain feeling of fait accompli because with the Turkish
                    army in northern Cyprus, no one believed that it would be possible to get the
                    Turks to withdraw their army. One tried at the time to get the Turks to at least
                    reduce the number of forces, but I don't think anybody really expected the Turks
                    to give the whole thing up. There was some hope that possibly the communal
                    negotiations between Clerides and Denktash might...this was really after
                    Makarios because he wasn't disposed to be reasonable about anything. Their whole
                    effort was to get the Turks off the island and get back to where they were
                    before, which I think no one really felt was a viable possibility. But at that
                    time, less thought was probably given to how this would evolve in the future. Of
                    course it was not possible for the United States to take a position or appear to
                    take a position which in effect accepted the status quo. That was something you
                    couldn't even think about because with the bad blood between the Greeks and the
                    Turks the effort was to try to find some formula that would in effect reduce the
                    Turkish presence and hopefully through the communal negotiations reach a point
                    where there could be perhaps a restoration of the Republic of Cyprus as before
                    with greater autonomy for the Turkish population.</p>
                <p>As you remember prior to the coup there was a Greek President of Cyprus and a
                    Turkish Vice President. The Greeks were clearly in the majority. But there was
                    some hope that somehow through these communal negotiations you could get an
                    improved situation for the Turks and hopefully the Turkish army would go
                    away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in your heart of hearts though did you think anything
                        would come of this? Was this something you really had to do but thought....
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think probably most of us at the time recognized that in a sense what
                    the Turks had done would probably in the long run ease the situation because you
                    then have a division between these two groups and less possibility in the long
                    run of communal clashes. And that in fact is what has come about. Quite clearly
                    when you are dealing with this sort of a problem you never can take the
                    position...but somehow we have to get fully involved. So, no, I don't think
                    anybody would put down on paper let's let this thing just hang out and take care
                    of itself. The main thrust really of what Kissinger was trying to do was to try
                    to reduce the level of animosity between Greece and Turkey as much as possible
                    and, as I said before, let them get back to their main task. Although this was
                    very complicated because the whole discussion all the time between the Greeks
                    and Turks was about the air control area and what was Greek and what was
                    Turkish, what islands would ....</p>

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes. President Bush is in Greece at the present moment and is facing
                    violent demonstrations because the Greeks think we are more friends with the
                    Turks than we are towards the Greeks.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another thing on this issue, I may be over-dwelling, but I
                        think this brings so many things together—how we work. In one interview I
                        did the interviewee spoke with Senator Javits, who was from New York, Jewish
                        and an ardent proponent of Israel, telling him: “You think the Jewish lobby
                        is a problem in the United States, wait until the Greek lobby gets going
                        because the Jewish concentration is in New York, California, and Florida,
                        but there are Greeks spread out throughout the United States and also in
                        positions of considerable political importance. Just wait until this gets
                        aroused.” I think this issue sort of proved the value of what had been said
                        prior to this. Did the Greek lobby catch the Department of State by surprise
                        as to how powerful it became? This was the first time it really became
                        organized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think it was a matter of some surprise to see the lobby as well
                    organized as it was. I had this brought back to me once again when in 1978 after
                    coming back from Spain. I was helping on the Hill in talking to Senators and
                    Congressman about the importance of lifting the arms embargo against Turkey. I
                    went to see the Congressman from Maryland, who died shortly thereafter, and
                    talked to him about the importance of our relations with Turkey. He said, “I
                    absolutely agree with you. I don't think Congress ought to be nickel and
                    dime-ing the State Department on all these things and getting involved in all
                    the nitty gritty of day to day operations. I think the Turkish arms embargo
                    should be lifted, but I intend to vote against it for the very simple reason
                    that my main fund raiser in the State is a Greek-American and therefore there is
                    no way that I can vote in favor of this matter even though I fully agree that it
                    should be done.” So again, that showed the power of the lobby even years after
                    the intensity of the thing had died down. As I said earlier there was absolutely
                    no Turkish lobby whatsoever. Consequently the Greek lobby did get Congress to do
                    pretty much what they thought it should do and there was tremendous pressures on
                    the State Department, the Secretary to take a more pro-Greek line.</p>
                <p>I think it is to Kissinger's credit that he...although it caused him a lot of
                    trouble because, as I said earlier, there were Members of Congress who believed
                    that he had outright lied to them on the business of the original question of
                    should we not impose an arms embargo on the Turks because all these US arms are
                    going into Cyprus. I think there were many of us who felt that the Turks had
                    enormously complicated our task. It was at least understandable, the first wave
                    of invasion, because there was aggression in protecting their population in
                    Cyprus. That could be argued, if you will, under the rubric of self defense. But
                    then when some weeks later they sent in the second wave, there was no real
                    justification for so doing. That enormously complicated our task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>STABLER: I think they did it because they wanted to consolidate their gains and
                    to make it absolutely clear that they had no intention of giving up. I think
                    this was actually done after the Colonels had been thrown out. I think they were
                    concerned that the Greeks might try to launch some military operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there certainly were some noises about the Greek
                        military talking about fighting there and sending in an expedition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: They sent naval vessels and there was the famous episode where in the
                    middle of the night...I was down in the Operations Center and there were all
                    sorts of alarms and excursions about the Greek naval force and then the Turks
                    announced with much pride that they had sunk a Greek destroyer. Then it turned
                    out that they had sunk one of their own.</p>
                <p>I think it was also part of the domestic problems in Turkey that was responsible
                    for this. Their economic and the political situation was always in turmoil. The
                    Prime Minister of Turkey and the army gained considerable popular support
                    because they were defending the Turkish population in Cyprus.</p>
                <p>So I don't think any of us felt that the second invasion was really necessary.
                    They had frankly sent in enough in the first place to defend the population and
                    the second invasion was just a grand stand play which caused us many
                    problems.</p>
                <p>In any event, I think from a personal point of view, I found it a fascinating
                    experience being able to work as closely as I did with Kissinger and seeing what
                    a difficult person he could be on these things. I found that those who permitted
                    themselves to be brow beaten and simply accepted it, soon fell by the wayside.
                    Those who stood up to him, but were not right sometimes in their advice, also
                    fell by the wayside. Those who stood up to him and knew their dossier fared
                    pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the points about Kissinger that is raised again and
                        again is that he tended to do things by himself with foreign leaders and
                        that those working to support him, such as you, often would find themselves
                        dealing without quite knowing what the game was. Was this a problem in this
                        case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I never felt that. I felt that I knew what he was doing because I often
                    did it for him. I often was in the room and sometimes on the telephone listening
                    in when he was talking to these foreign leaders. I wrote most of the messages,
                    obviously not 100 percent, but most of them that he sent these people. And I
                    went to the White House with him on some of these things. So I felt that on the
                    whole I had fairly good knowledge of what he was doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Mind you, there were...Arthur Hartman and I had a very good relationship. For
                    example, when I went on a trip with Kissinger to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan,
                    Iran, when we got to Rome where he was going to have talks with the Italians,
                    Arthur Hartman came on board and I was finished, because at that point there
                    wasn't room for both of us. But Arthur pretty much kept me abreast of what was
                    going on and as the year wore on...I went over to London a few times to talk to
                    the British about the problem... I never felt that Kissinger was trying to
                    exclude me or that he was not keeping the Bureau of European Affairs through
                    Arthur Hartman and myself, pretty much informed of what he was up to. He
                    believed, I think at times erroneously, that his superior intelligence would
                    easily win over some of these people. They just couldn't resist the force of his
                    logic and therefore they would soon see that he was right and they were not.
                    But, I think, at times we ignored some of the realities of the situation. But in
                    each instance it was worth the try. You couldn't go wrong in putting forward
                    your own point of view to these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the other shoe. While this was going, one of our
                        major concerns was that you didn't want to have two NATO allies fighting
                        each other because NATO was the bulwark and here was the southern flank
                        against the Soviet Union. You must have been monitoring very closely what
                        the Soviet Union was doing. Did you get any feel that the Soviets were going
                        to try to take advantage, or were they taking advantage of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I don't recall any situation where the Soviets seemed to be a
                    threatening factor in all this. Obviously there were Communists in Greece and
                    some of this carried over into Cyprus I am sure, but I don't know that this was
                    necessarily as a result of any Soviet doing. I can't recall now that this
                    particular aspect entered into the equation in any important way. The real
                    concern, of course, was that...and then there were alarms and excursions
                    throughout this period of reports that the Turks were massing to invade Greece
                    or that Greece was reinforcing their forces along the border and there soon
                    would be problems. There were a lot of rumors in those days. I don't recall that
                    there was any serious information at any time that the Turks and Greeks were
                    about to clash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember I had left Greece within a week or two of the
                        coup in Cyprus. At the country team meetings, the military attach� used to
                        say that if the Greeks and Turks were at each other they will have
                        ammunition for about one week and then they will basically run out. Turning
                        away from this particular thing but talking about your role in dealing with
                        Western Europe, were there any major problems that you had to deal with in
                        the 1973-75 period—West Germany, France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: No. I think we have covered previously the coup in Portugal and I don't
                    remember that there were any major problems that came up during that period. Q:
                    Those seem to be sort of on both flanks, the peripheral of NATO.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>STABLER: You had the usual political turmoil in Italy which wasn't all that
                    important really. There was always the question of Berlin, but I didn't get much
                    involved in that. I just don't recall at the moment. It seems there was a period
                    when I was fairly active on German Affairs. A fellow by the name of Jim
                    Sutherland was at that time in charge of Germany, but I can't recall that there
                    were any major problems such as the Cyprus problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on this European affairs business. How
                        did you and people around you view the development of the Common Market. Was
                        it seen as something that was going to go anywhere? Was there concern that
                        this might prove to be a problem with our getting into the European
                        market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: At that period, I think we were still very much supporting the idea of a
                    common market because we were trying to bring the Europeans more closely
                    together...this went back to the Treaty of Rome, which I guess was in the middle
                    50s...hoping that this ultimately would lead to a European political community.
                    I don't think there was any recognition or concern yet that the Europeans had
                    reached the stage when they would basically threaten our economic situation. So
                    I think it was viewed in political and economic terms as a desirable policy.
                    There may have been some at the time who worried a little bit about what
                    ultimately might be the economic consequences of all this, but this was
                    certainly not an important element at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While the Cyprus thing was going on we were going through
                        the Watergate trauma and the slow political demise of President Nixon. Did
                        this have any impact on our operations? Henry Kissinger, obviously, was the
                        number one man in foreign affairs and also, really in a way, almost a
                        surrogate president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, he was in a sense almost what you might call a Prime Minister.
                    Curiously enough, Watergate didn't impact on our operations really. However,
                    when Nixon resigned we were extraordinarily busy for a couple of days writing up
                    letters for Ford to send to Heads of State saying, “plus �a change, plus c'est
                    la m�me chose” - nothing really changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you didn't have the feeling that things were at a
                        standstill or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Nothing really was at a standstill because we continued to operate.
                    Kissinger was running the thing as far as policy was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the problem of trying to explain to Europeans
                        who are very sophisticated what this Watergate thing was all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>STABLER: Not particularly. I think the people abroad had more of a problem there
                    because I think a lot of the people in Europe didn't understand what the fuss
                    was all about. But I wouldn't say that Watergate really affected the conduct of
                    foreign policy in any important way. Things went on. I don't recall that it
                    diminished the importance of what we had to say on various subjects. Nixon
                    resigned in August, 1974 and I made a number of my trips after that alone and
                    with Kissinger. Things went on the same. It was curious. You might have thought
                    that an upheaval of that sort would have created some troubles, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We come to the time when you served as Ambassador to Spain
                        from 1975-78. How did you get this appointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, during the Cyprus affair Kissinger decided whether he liked people
                    or not who were involved in some way or another. He decided that he liked Jack
                    Kubisch and sent him as Ambassador to Greece. At one point somebody said to me,
                    “Oh, Kissinger is thinking of making you Assistant Secretary for Latin American
                    Affairs.” I said, “Well, I'm not really wild about that. Frankly, I don't think
                    I particularly want that.” That amused me because years before somebody told me
                    that Dean Acheson, when I was a very junior officer was thinking about making me
                    Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs. That didn't come about either, but
                    in any case I wouldn't have wanted the ARA one.</p>
                <p>Time went on and I got involved as Deputy Assistant Secretary in some of the
                    discussions with the Spaniards in Washington on the base negotiations which had
                    begun. McCloskey had been made the chief negotiator and I knew him very well and
                    had worked very closely with him on Cyprus. Indeed he had been Ambassador to
                    Cyprus for one very brief period when Kissinger called him back to handle press
                    matters for him. There was clear evidence that Kissinger did not care for or
                    think that the Ambassador to Spain, who was a former Deputy Chief of Naval
                    Operations and the Commander-in-Chief, Southern Area, Naples, CINCSOUTH was
                    doing a good job and wanted to get rid of him. I was told that Kissinger was
                    thinking of sending me to Spain but that this depended on whether or not Peter
                    Flanagan would get the job. Peter Flanagan had been in Nixon's White House and
                    involved in the recruiting of political ambassadors of people who were
                    Republicans and important contributors to the Republican Party. Peter had pretty
                    much the say of who would and who wouldn't be appointed an Ambassador. I had
                    known Flanagan in the latter part of 1968, I believe, in Washington in
                    connection with his interest in US relations with the Vatican. In fact when the
                    Department was slow in obtaining for me a letter from Nixon according me the
                    personal rank of Minister in Rome, I went to Flanagan to ask him to expedite it
                    - that was in 1969 before I left for Rome.When Flanagan came to Rome shortly
                    after I had arrived, he brought with him the letter from Nixon. The department
                    never got over this maneuver, but there was nothing they could do about it. The
                    only thing I had to do was to date the letter - that had been forgotten in the
                    White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>In any event Peter came to Rome for discussions with the Vatican on how to
                    reinstitute US relations with the Vatican without going to full diplomatic
                    relations. These talks led eventually to the reinstitution of the Office of the
                    Personal Representative of the President to the Vatican. Henry Cabot Lodge was
                    appointed at that time and took up residence in Rome for periods several times a
                    year.</p>
                <p>Because of Flanagan's service to Nixon, I think that President Ford may have been
                    asked by Nixon to look after his friend, Peter Flanagan. So Ford sent Flanagan's
                    name up to the Senate as Ambassador to Spain. Peter had a lot of good friends in
                    Spain. He had been a banker before and had many friends abroad.</p>
                <p>Senator Eagleton from Missouri decided that he didn't like what Flanagan did in
                    the White House—selling embassies and what not. Eagleton got the Foreign
                    Relations Committee aroused about all this and at the end of the Senate
                    session...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might mention that some of the Nixon appointments,
                        particularly towards the end had been a little bit rank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think it was fairly blatant. They said, “You hand in a big check and
                    we will probably get you a good job.” In the case of Flanagan he came from a
                    very wealthy family and I am sure he got the job through his father. This was
                    the reward Nixon was trying to give him.</p>
                <p>By the end of the Senate session that summer the nomination lapsed. That fall I
                    was told by Larry Eagleburger that Kissinger still intended that I should go to
                    Spain but that Ford felt he had to make another effort for Flanagan. So when the
                    Senate reconvened in January 1975 Flanagan's name went up again. At the end of a
                    week, one of those curious instances, I was in the Department on a Saturday
                    afternoon and the telephone rang. I answered it and this voice said, “This is
                    Peter Flanagan, is Arthur Hartman there?” I said, “No, he is not. This is Wells
                    Stabler.” He said, “Well, I was just calling to let you all know that I have
                    asked to have my name withdrawn from the Senate.” Needless to say it was all I
                    could do not to say, “I am glad to hear that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Then I was told later that at some point that fall, I guess after Flanagan's name
                    had been withdrawn, Ford flew over to Japan and on the plane was Eagleburger,
                    Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld and the President. On the way over the President,
                    Kissinger and Rumsfeld were talking about various things and the question of
                    appointment of ambassadors came up. Kissinger said that he wanted to propose me
                    as Ambassador to Spain. Donald Rumsfeld said he didn't really agree with that,
                    that he had a man working for him who was a Foreign Service Officer by the name
                    of Gene McAuliffe who had been DCM in Spain for four or five years, and he was
                    the one who should really get the job. So at that point Kissinger said, “Well,
                    why don't we call Eagleburger in because he knows both of these people and let's
                    be guided by what he says.” So Eagleburger was called in and they said,
                    “Eagleburger, it is between Stabler and McAuliffe. Who would you recommend?”
                    Fortunately Eagleburger said me. So they said, “All right, he will be Ambassador
                    to Spain.”</p>
                <p>So then I was told that I was definitely going to have the job. The papers were
                    sent out to Ford who was then skiing in Vail. This doesn't seem possible, but it
                    happened—the papers got lost. So they had to start the whole process over again.
                    Eventually the papers were approved and the agr�ment requested. So it was late
                    January, 1975 before I was formally nominated...the appointment had leaked and
                    was in the press in December. In due course, possibly February, I had my Senate
                    confirmation hearing presided over by John Sparkman ,the Senator from Alabama
                    who was then somewhat in his dotage. Curiously enough I think I appeared on the
                    same day that McCloskey appeared to be Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs.
                    The only question Sparkman asked me was whether I was related in any way to the
                    University of Alabama football star. This was not something I would immediately
                    know. But I somehow knew through my younger son who was an aficionado of
                    professional football that the person he had in mind was the quarterback of the
                    Oakland Raiders, Kenny Stabler. So I was able to say to him that if I hadn't
                    been related to Kenny at the beginning of the season I certainly was by the end
                    of it. That satisfied him and he went off to sleep. Then I was asked other
                    questions, but very few about Spain. Javits, whom I knew quite well, and Hubert
                    Humphrey, whom I also knew and in fact had traveled twice with him when he was
                    Vice President, were very friendly. Humphrey was the only one who got into
                    substantive discussions about the Mediterranean. I was somewhat concerned that I
                    would be asked awkward questions about the Franco regime which would be
                    difficult to answer because you certainly didn't want to say something
                    unfriendly and then find yourself in Spain a couple of weeks later.</p>
                <p>Time was moving on, the former ambassador had already left. So I had to step on
                    the gas, particularly as the Spanish had told us that if I arrived prior to the
                    middle of March I could present my credentials immediately. Otherwise I would
                    have to wait until after Easter. I arrived in Madrid on March 11, which was very
                    quick, and presented my credentials to Franco on March 13, 1975.</p>

                        a problem but that was being covered by a special setup wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: The first phases of the negotiations began in 1973 in Washington—I think
                    Bill Porter was Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Then it got going more
                    actively in 1974 and McCloskey was named special negotiator. I became more
                    involved in that because of the European's Bureau interest in it. The man who
                    was sent over by Spain was Juan Jos� Rovira the Under Secretary of Foreign
                    Affairs. He ultimately became a very close friend of ours in Madrid. So the
                    negotiations took place now in Washington and now in Madrid. I didn't come back
                    for the Washington ones, but I played a very active role in the negotiations in
                    Madrid. Ultimately I directly negotiated three or four of the chapters without
                    McCloskey. It was a question that the Spanish were beginning to feel rather
                    strongly that we had too much for too little and they were particularly
                    concerned over the presence of...well, they weren't “bases” - they were called
                    “facilities” because the fiction was that these were Spanish bases on which
                    Americans had facilities. So the flag at the entrance to the base was the
                    Spanish flag not both flags, although there were American MP's along with the
                    Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at Torrejon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: This was at Torrejon. We had a big facilities at Torrejon and we had
                    another one at Zaragoza which was basically an all-weather bombing range which
                    was used by our squadrons from Germany. We had another big standby operation in
                    Moron, not too far from Seville. And then we had a large naval base in Rota,
                    where we also had nuclear vessels.</p>
                <p>The Spanish were troubled by this large facility in Torrejon so close also to the
                    main airfield of Madrid, Barajas, which was practically on the same pattern. In
                    the air you could see the two airports side by side practically. They were also
                    a little concerned by some of the tankers that we had up at Zaragoza and by the
                    Polarises at Rota.</p>
                <p>But the main concern was Torrejon. So they pressed very hard indeed for the
                    elimination of the facility at Torrejon. The negotiations in 1975 were tough
                    ones because of all of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>During that time I would see the Spanish Foreign Minister, Pedro Cortina Mauri,
                    quite frequently on a whole series of things. In May, 1975, Ford chose to make a
                    visit to Spain. It was one of those rather curious things where the decision is
                    made in Washington and the Ambassador is simply told that he is coming. I guess,
                    in all honesty, I wouldn't have tried to oppose it, although at that time—I
                    digress a bit here—there was the feeling on the part of quite a few Spaniards,
                    particularly those in the so-called democratic opposition, which existed but was
                    very closely controlled by the Franco government...but there were stirrings, the
                    Socialist party was around, it wasn't legal, and there were others who were
                    taking views that were somewhat different than the Francoists on the political
                    constitutional construction of the country. There was some feeling that we were
                    unnecessarily supporting Franco. That we were the big friend because we had
                    these facilities.</p>
                <p>When I heard about the visit I suggested to Kissinger and the President that
                    while the President was in Madrid he ought to receive a number of the so-called
                    democratic opposition, but not going as far as the Socialists, which would have
                    been a bit more than the traffic could have borne. I got the green light to set
                    this up and I went to see the Prime Minister. My strategy had been to wait until
                    the Foreign Minister had gone out of town. He had gone to Paris to an OECD
                    meeting. I thought the Prime Minister, Carlos Arias Navarro, would be perhaps a
                    bit more receptive to this idea.So I went to see him and told him that the
                    President would like to meet with this group when he was in Madrid and showed
                    the Prime Minister this highly innocuous list - I pointed out that they were all
                    people who freely expressed their views and were well-known to the Government
                    and to the Spanish people. He blanched and quickly gave me the list back and
                    appeared horrified and immediately got in touch with the Foreign Minister who
                    was in Paris. The Under Secretary called me and asked what was this that was
                    going on. Then the Foreign Minister got in touch with Kissinger in Paris and
                    said there was no place for this kind of meeting in the State visit.</p>
                <p>I regretted very much that we caved. It is difficult for me to put myself in
                    Kissinger's shoes, he had supported this thing, but he obviously didn't want the
                    Spanish visit to go awry. I think, myself, in retrospect, I could have perhaps
                    been instructed to say to the Prime Minister: “The President really wants to do
                    this, there is ample room in the program for it, they are all Spanish citizens
                    and the President would like to meet with them. If this doesn't seem possible,
                    then perhaps he had better not come to Madrid.” It would have sent a very good
                    signal to have done that. Instead I was told to drop the whole thing. Later, I
                    sat next to the Prime Minister at lunch with the President and raised this
                    matter. He said it was not a question of the people but that it just wasn't
                    appropriate in the context of a State visit. Well, of course, that was
                    ridiculous. What it really came down to was that they didn't think Franco would
                    accept the idea of the President seeing anybody who was even remotely associated
                    with what might be called an opposition.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>The Socialists, particularly, were very resentful that we had the visit. They
                    felt we were propping the regime up. I feel myself that if we had had this
                    meeting it would have sent a good political signal that we were open to other
                    points of view. This was almost as bad when several years later—I will come back
                    to the bases in a minute—when Adolfo Suarez, the Prime Minister of Spain, came
                    to this country for a visit. Carter was then President and received him and
                    riding over to the White House with Secretary Vance and George Vest, I was told
                    out of the blue that the President was about to tell the Spanish Prime Minister
                    that Vice President Walter Mondale, who was going to Europe shortly after this,
                    was also going to Spain. This was prior to a Spanish election and I told Vance
                    and Vest that I thought this was an overkill. We really shouldn't appear to be
                    selecting a chosen instrument and that Mondale could perfectly well go somewhere
                    else and not come to Spain. We just had the Prime Minister in Washington. We did
                    not have to have the Vice President in Spain. And they agreed. But, of course,
                    by the time they got to the White House, the Prime Minister was already there
                    and in Carter's office. Carter told Suarez that Mondale was going to Spain and
                    that was that</p>
                <p>Later I recommended that when Mondale was in Madrid a reception be held at the
                    Embassy to which I could invite leaders of the democratic opposition parties.
                    The Communist Party leader would, of course, not be invited, since Embassies
                    abroad were under strictures to have no contact with that party. The Prime
                    Minister was the head of the Union of the Democratic Center which was a
                    coalition that had been thrown together. But there were other legal opposition
                    parties, including the Socialists. This would have been the first time many of
                    these people would have been able to meet one of our two principal elected
                    officials.</p>
                <p>I couldn't believe my eyes when I got a message from Washington saying, “This has
                    been turned down because it would be considered undemocratic for the leaders of
                    the democratic opposition to come excluding the communists. And although we had
                    a very strict policy of not seeing any communists, as the communists couldn't be
                    invited you cannot do the rest of it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was that coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I sent a message to London where Vance and Vest were. I said I could not
                    believe that this could be correct and gave the reasons why. I got a message
                    back saying that it was. Still to this day I do not know the rationale for it.
                    David Aaron who was the Assistant National Security Adviser to National Security
                    Assistant Zbig Brzezinski , apparently made the decision that you couldn't do
                    something of this sort that didn't have all of the political parties. Yet only a
                    short time after all of that happened, we got a message from Washington saying,
                    “You are strictly instructed not to have anything to do at the ambassadorial
                    level with communist parties although you might be able to have some contact at
                    a lower level.” When Aaron came with Mondale, I asked him about this, but he
                    just didn't have a very good explanation. So it was that sort of thing that
                    drove one wild.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of a tinkering by people who really didn't know what
                        they were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Basically again where you have a professional ambassador on the spot he
                    knows what the situation is, he knows what should be done, he knows we don't
                    have any relations with the Communist Party. No one in Spain would have had the
                    slightest concern at the fact that the communists hadn't been there. The others
                    would have come, they wouldn't have minded. They wouldn't have boycotted the
                    thing if the Communists were not there. At all the receptions and things that I
                    had at the Residence I never had a communist at them and all the others all
                    came.</p>
                <p>Anyway, what started me on this long digression was the reference to Pedro
                    Cortina Mauri, the Foreign Minister, with whom I had many talks concerning the
                    negotiations. In these discussions with him, he was trying to present the idea
                    that in our negotiations on these “facilities” we should set up a structure
                    which would in effect duplicate the structure of NATO. Spain, obviously couldn't
                    be a member of NATO as Franco was still around, but they wanted to have
                    something which was more than just an arrangement on facilities. In Spain you
                    had...in the NATO you had a council, a political committee, an economic
                    committee, a military committee etc. He would draw a diagram of the NATO
                    structure and then he would draw a little diagram, little boxes, etc. with all
                    the structures he wanted on the Spanish side and then there would be a line
                    between the two which would be the US. In other words the US would be the link
                    between NATO and Spain.</p>
                <p>I used to tease him about this because one day he repeated his diagram drawing
                    circles rather than boxes. So I said, “Oh, Mr. Minister, I am very interested to
                    see that your policy has totally changed.” He looked terribly surprised and
                    said, “What do you mean?” I said, “You are talking about circles today, not
                    squares.” Cortina, who was quite serious and of whom I was quite fond, had to
                    smile</p>
                <p>The negotiations went on and we got into tough discussions because the Spanish in
                    effect said, “No agreement unless you leave Torrejon.” We were not prepared to
                    do that. Then came the fall of 1975 when Franco had decided to execute five or
                    six Basque terrorists who had killed civil guards and policemen. This caused an
                    enormous storm in Europe. Most of Western Europe withdrew their ambassadors,
                    etc. I happened to be in the States at that particular time so there was no
                    question about my being withdrawn.</p>
                <p>This was the time that the General Assembly was starting and the Spanish Foreign
                    Minister came over and asked to see Kissinger. We met in Kissinger's suite in
                    the Waldorf. The thrust of all this was— “My mission from Franco is to get
                    agreement, get something signed. Therefore we are prepared to let you keep
                    everything that you have. The only thing we ask is that before I leave to return
                    to Madrid we sign a framework agreement which can then be fleshed out into a
                    formal executive agreement.”</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>So we sat down and with circles and boxes we created with the Spanish exactly
                    what Cortina had originally talked to me about. We met in Washington at the
                    Spanish Embassy and Kissinger and Cortina initialed the framework agreement,
                    which set up this new sort of structure for the facilities agreement. It was
                    understood that we would keep everything that we had in Spain, including
                    Torrejon.</p>
                <p>I went back to Spain and shortly thereafter Bob McCloskey came to have another
                    round of negotiations. We sat down in the conference room in the Foreign
                    Ministry and the Spanish delegation started again with extremely stiff
                    statements about the need to get out of Torrejon, etc. So McCloskey and I looked
                    at each other in considerable surprise. We said we really couldn't understand
                    this because this was exactly diametrically opposed to what the Foreign Minister
                    had just said in the States and indeed which had been incorporated in a
                    document. We, therefore, requested a suspension of the session and requested an
                    immediate meeting with the Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>We went to see him and told him what had happened. He told us that he was
                    embarrassed to say that he had not told his delegation anything of this yet and
                    they didn't know what had been agreed to. The only thing that he would ask of us
                    was to perhaps give up Moron, the standby base. We said we saw no problem with
                    that, if that was what they wanted.</p>
                <p>We didn't resume negotiations immediately because the Foreign Minister had to
                    inform his delegation what they were to do. So far, I think this had been
                    between himself, Franco and the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>Shortly after that Franco became ill and everything stopped. It wasn't until
                    after he died and after the King had taken over in November that a new
                    government was formed and Jos� Maria Areilza, the Count of Motrico ,became
                    Foreign Minister. Areilza requested an urgent meeting with Kissinger. Both
                    Kissinger and Areilza were in Paris for an OECD meeting. I had been at a Chiefs
                    of Mission meeting in London and went down to Paris for this meeting with the
                    Spanish Foreign Minister and Kissinger. At that meeting the Foreign Minister
                    said that it was important for Spain to have an agreement with the United States
                    just after the King's advent to the Throne to show that the United States was
                    fully in support of the new government.</p>
                <p>He asked only three things - one, that we turn the previous Executive Agreement
                    into a treaty, secondly, that we remove the Polaris submarines from Rota, and
                    thirdly, that we somehow manage to appear to be giving Spain a billion dollars.
                    He said that in return for that Spain would agree that we could keep
                    everything.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>The Polaris submarines was due to return home anyway, so that was no problem.
                    Kissinger felt that, in light of the change in the regime with the King taking
                    over and the possibility of a democratic government, we probably could do a
                    treaty. He said we would certainly examine how much we could come up with to
                    satisfy the third request. It was agreed that Kissinger would come to Madrid on
                    the January 24, 1976 to initial a paper along the lines of what had been
                    discussed. It was to follow the framework which had been previously agreed with
                    then former Foreign Minister Cortina Mauri.</p>
                <p>So we set to work in early January with the Spaniards in Madrid. McCloskey came
                    over and worked closely with the military side. The cultural, political and
                    economic parts of the agreement I did myself. By this time the Spanish
                    delegation was aware of what had been agreed to with regard to our keeping the
                    facilities.. The only thing was the question of Moron again. We said that we had
                    agreed to give that up and wanted to point out to them that, in agreeing to give
                    it up, we were no longer responsible for its maintenance, physically or
                    financially. At this point, the Spaniards said we could have it back again. They
                    didn't want to have to pay the maintenance. So the result was that we kept
                    everything we previously had.</p>
                <p>Then we set about putting it in treaty form and agreed to a phased period of
                    removing the Polarises. Then we went about trying somehow to establish the
                    billion dollar figure. We did everything, including practically adding in the
                    page numbers, just to reach that figure. There was some grant military
                    assistance, some military sales guarantees, and a whole series of things. So
                    when you put it all together it looked like a billion dollars, but in point of
                    fact we gave them basically a few million in military grants with the rest in
                    military sales which they got at a reasonable rate but for which they paid. But
                    somehow it looked as if we were giving them a billion.</p>
                <p>Kissinger appeared in Madrid and on January 24, 1976 initialed the Treaty which
                    had been prepared. In due course it was sent to the Senate.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>In early June, 1976 King Juan Carlos came to the United States on a State Visit.
                    When Ford was in Madrid in May 1975 we tried very hard to arrange it so that the
                    President would meet with Juan Carlos with only Kissinger and me present. This
                    was to take place after lunch at the guest palace, the Moncloa Palace, where
                    Ford was staying. That Palace is .now the Residence and office of the Prime
                    Minister, or as he is called in Spain, President of the Government.. After lunch
                    all the Spaniards left including the Foreign Minister, my friend Pedro Cortina
                    Mauri. We thought this was fine and could now have the meeting, as we had
                    planned. But much to our horror, Cortina returned just in time for the meeting
                    with the Prince. I told Kissinger that the only way we were going to be able to
                    deal with this was that he would have to stay out of the meeting, and obviously
                    I would too, because that was the only way we could keep the Foreign Minister
                    out. That would be the only way that the Prince would feel he could talk very
                    freely. So that was what happened. Kissinger hated it, but he realized that if
                    he went in then so would the Spanish Foreign Minister, and the Prince wouldn't
                    say a thing. The Prince made a big impression on Ford and spoke very freely and
                    frankly. Kissinger ultimately became quite a close friend of the Prince. I
                    should add here that before I went to Madrid I was given briefings in Washington
                    to the effect that the Prince was a handsome fellow but pretty lightheaded on
                    top. After I got there and had talked with him a few times, I told Washington
                    that wasn't true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this type of information coming from do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: It came largely I think from the trips the Prince made overseas and when
                    he had to be terribly careful what he said and did, so he didn't talk much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he sort of playing Prince Hal waiting to become Henry
                        V?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think to some extent. He also realized that he was created by Franco
                    for this and therefore publicly had to be very, very careful. So he was all
                    smiles and dances, charming and glittering and lightweight most people thought.
                    I don't know to what extent my predecessors really got to know him because I
                    would have thought if they had they would have realized that there was a good
                    deal more than met the eye. So the conventional wisdom of my briefings in
                    Washington was that while he was a nice fellow, he was sort of a lightweight
                    with no particular role. Fortunately, he was very outspoken and used to talk
                    very freely, which used to surprise me at times. But it all led me to believe
                    that he had a certain amount of native intelligence, that he was no one's
                    prisoner and that he had many people that he knew from his travels with whom he
                    kept in touch. People like Bob Mosbacher ,Secretary of Commerce. They were both
                    yachtsmen. He used to talk to Kissinger on the phone. All sorts of people that
                    he would meet and talk with and get ideas. By the time he became King, Kissinger
                    realized there was someone here of considerable substance, so he was invited to
                    the States very quickly after he became King.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Juan Carlos prepared a speech for him to give before a Joint session of Congress
                    in Washington. This had been written by a variety of people, including members
                    of his staff. The King sent it to me to help with the English translation. I
                    took it as my cue to make suggestions on it, which I did. In the draft the first
                    part went on at enormous length about the history of Spanish-US relations. The
                    second part, relatively brief, concerned the events in Spain and his vision for
                    the future</p>
                <p>I recommended to him that he flesh out the second part and cut down the first
                    part. I also suggested that At the outset he say that his speech would be in two
                    parts, the first on history, the second on current events in Spain. I said that
                    without that preamble he would simply lose his audience who would think it was
                    going to be a lightweight speech about the history of US-Spanish relations.</p>
                <p>He did that and the speech was a remarkable one and very well received. He
                    outlined in the second part the democratic Spain he envisioned. It was partly,
                    of course, for the US Congress, but basically it was for the audience at home.
                    He felt that he could more safely do that sort of thing abroad rather than at
                    home, because he was a constitutional monarch and was not supposed to be
                    involved in the political evolution. Let me add parenthetically that the King
                    said to me more than once that he had to be careful, because he was not only
                    once a Bourbon, but twice a Bourbon. This, of course, referred to the fact that
                    his grandfather, Alfonso XIII, had meddled in politics and had been forced to
                    abdicate. Juan Carlos was a Bourbon through his father and through his
                    mother.</p>
                <p>The speech, delivered by the King in his excellent English, also the added effect
                    of making the Senate pro-King and pro-treaty. So when the Treaty finally came to
                    the Senate it was approved by an overwhelming majority. For the first time we
                    had a Treaty rather than an Executive Agreement incorporating the facilities and
                    setting up this structure which was somewhat of a carbon copy of the NATO
                    structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of a shadow NATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: A shadow NATO. Of course, now Spain is a member of NATO. The Treaty has
                    been written with that in mind and we had not given up Torrejon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Continuing with the treaty business, was there the feeling
                        that when Franco goes that Spain very likely will go under NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>STABLER: Well, I don't think so. I think there was a lot of misgivings. A lot of
                    people in Europe and elsewhere felt that the King simply would continue the
                    Franco regime...the Franco structure would remain in place and he would simply
                    be a figurehead of the Franco regime, version II. In fact, when he came to this
                    country in June, 1976, he had a meeting with newspaper publishers, etc. here in
                    Washington and they said to him; “Well, we don't see that anything has changed
                    in Spain. You still have Arias Navarro as Prime Minister. He was Franco's Prime
                    Minister. You have this, you have that and you have the other thing. You don't
                    seem to have changed anything.” The King replied, “Well, I will also say to you
                    that you don't seem to have changed your people. The newspaper people reporting
                    on Spain today are the people who reported on Spain under Franco. They don't see
                    what is going on, what is changing.” That was in early June and on July 4, a
                    month later, he dropped Arias Navarro and brought in Adolfo Suarez. This was all
                    being done in steps. It couldn't be down overnight.</p>
                <p>He had to feel his way. Suarez had been brought up as a functionary in the
                    Falange, which was the Franco political structure, and had followed a career up
                    the ladder as a Franco functionary. Suarez had no idea basically what a
                    democracy was. He was young, attractive, a good TV personality, liked the King,
                    the King liked him, and he was ambitious. There were many people associated with
                    some of these younger Franco people who recognized that you couldn't carry on
                    the regime without Franco and that indeed you could, without too much
                    difficulty, modify the Organic laws of the Franco regime as a transition towards
                    democracy by simple changes. And that is what happened. By simple changes, they
                    maintained the same structure with a new Prime Minister, ultimately leading, of
                    course, to rewriting the constitution and leading to elections. The constitution
                    wasn't finally finished until sometime in 1978, so the first elections under the
                    new constitution was in '78 or '79. But in the meantime, Spain had moved from
                    the dictatorship of Franco into a democratic regime without changing any of the
                    laws. I mean without revoking these fundamental Organic laws - they were simply
                    adapted to the new situation.</p>
                <p>That was one of the big arguments I used to have with some of the members of the
                    democratic opposition, particularly the Socialists and the Christian Democrats
                    who said that the slate needed to be cleaned. It was essential to start from
                    scratch. I would say that that was a very dangerous thing to do. You had to have
                    something in place and work on that and gradually work into the next phase. But
                    don't just destroy everything and start from the beginning, because that would
                    lead to immense trouble because you would have no reference points. Now you have
                    a reference point which with certain changes will lead towards what you
                    eventually want to do. Fortunately that is what they finally did. Some of them
                    recognized that it was far less dangerous to do it gradually than to try to do
                    it all over night.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back to one final thing about the base
                        negotiations. How did you find...often the hardest thing with the base
                        negotiation is not with the foreign government but with that other foreign
                        government, our Department of Defense...they dealt...after all if you had a
                        standby base and you had a base Torrejon which has high visibility close to
                        Madrid, wasn't there a feeling on your part or someone else's part of “Oh,
                        hell, let's just move it over to Moron and put it there and not”...did you
                        get the feeling that once our military gets established and used to a place
                        for perks or other reasons or were there substantive reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I don't think Moron would have been able to handle the type of thing
                    that existed in Torrejon. Moron base was a standby base which had hospital
                    equipment and things like that. It was not up to the standard that we had at
                    Torrejon. It would have meant basically an enormous structural job and I don't
                    think the Spaniards would have been wild about having it that close to Seville
                    either. The alternatives were keeping it or getting out.</p>
                <p>I think when our military had to examine what the Spaniards were demanding they
                    had to make then the decision of which was more important—Torrejon or Moron. You
                    could have Rota and Zaragoza. But you couldn't have Torrejon. Zaragoza was the
                    only all weather bombing range we had in Europe. It was essential.</p>
                <p>At that time we had not told the Spanish that we were prepared to go from
                    Torrejon. Obviously blood, sweat and tears were being produced in Washington
                    over getting the Pentagon to agree that's what they would probably have to do. I
                    wasn't really involved in that. It was all done in Washington.</p>
                <p>I was very fond of Bob McCloskey. It never struck me as if he had a great grip on
                    all of this, but I may be wrong on all of that. Obviously here in Washington
                    when it came to the business of dealing with the Pentagon, it wasn't just Bob
                    McCloskey who got involved. There was the Deputy Secretary, the Assistant
                    Secretary of EUR, Political Military Bureau, etc. So it was then the weight of
                    the institution that was being brought to bear on the whole Pentagon. I don't
                    doubt but that they had quite a time to get the Pentagon to agree to this. But I
                    always found these negotiations frustrating because again to try to get our
                    government organized into action with somebody making a decision about something
                    could be awfully painful.</p>
                <p>We had not yet gotten to the point of telling the Spanish we were getting out of
                    Torrejon, and when the time actually came to do it, I don't know what would have
                    happened—whether we would have done so or not. If the Spanish had said that
                    there would be no facilities agreement of any sort unless you do this, that was
                    the price we were apparently prepared to pay. But in the final analysis at that
                    time we did not have to make that agonizing decision. Indeed, it is the price we
                    are prepared to pay today but in different circumstances because Spain is part
                    of NATO. The Italians rallied around and gave us additional facilities and now
                    you have the whole changed situation in Europe anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>But I think one of the most difficult things of all is that negotiations with
                    foreign governments are difficult enough, but negotiations within one's own
                    government are sometimes hopeless.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a continuing interview with Ambassador Wells
                        Stabler. Today is July 30, 1991. Mr. Ambassador we covered a good number of
                        things in Spain already. Particularly the bases issue, how you or one dealt
                        with Juan Carlos, etc. I wonder if we could talk now a little about the
                        period when Franco fell ill. There was sort of a death watch. Was this as
                        the Spanish would put it a parenthesis in the Spanish political
                        developments—everybody was waiting for the shoe to drop? How did you deal
                        with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I had seen him at the “Dia de La Raza” (Columbus Day in Spain)
                    ceremonial function at the Institute of Ibero- American Relations, which was a
                    creation of Franco. Apparently at that function on October 12, 1975 he caught a
                    chill. Four or five days thereafter he had a heart attack and was extremely
                    ill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: In October 1975. As I said earlier, we had still been negotiating the
                    base agreement. When Franco fell ill, basically everything stopped in Spain. The
                    whole system of government just came to a halt. No business was conducted.
                    Indeed, there was this incredible sort of death watch that went on as the man
                    lay ill and was then operated on two or three times. There were incredible tales
                    about the operations being performed in the El Pardo Palace where he lived and
                    how a room had been turned into an operating room and how all the hangers-on
                    gathered in the room right next to it. Doors were swinging open between the
                    reception room and the operating room with people going in and out. It was
                    utterly chaotic. But, of course, this was an enormously traumatic thing in many
                    ways. He had been in power since 1936. That was 39 years and everything had
                    rotated around him. The process of government halted.</p>
                <p>Of course, at about that time there was one major development which caused
                    problems in Spain and also basically for us. That was the famous Green March in
                    Morocco where the Moroccans had started a march to take over Spanish
                    Morocco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was led by the King.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, essentially led by the King. The problem here was that, with
                    Franco lying gravely ill, there was no one clearly in charge and the Spanish
                    were nervous about it. The military wanted to take military action. Others felt
                    this would be a very serious thing and in any event Spanish Morocco wasn't all
                    that important to Spain, far more important were the enclaves in the northern
                    part of Morocco, Ceuta and Mellila.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Then the TV programs, of course, showed this Green March and showed at one point
                    a man struggling along carrying an American flag. So the Spanish became very
                    suspicious that we were involved in some way behind it. I, of course, assured
                    them we were not. I had some residual suspicions that in some way we may have
                    given some logistic or planning support to King Hassan of Morocco with respect
                    to the Green March. It was quite a few miles from the Moroccan border to the
                    capital of Spanish Morocco. We had some very difficult times with the Spanish
                    over this. Then at one point, Juan Carlos, as Prince of Spain, made a visit to
                    Spanish Morocco to show the flag and assure the Spanish residents that Madrid
                    was standing behind them. I don't know if he was able to do a great deal, but it
                    is quite possible that he played even more an important role then than was known
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>We, of course, tried to urge calm and that they not take up arms. Interestingly
                    enough, that was what happened. I say interestingly enough because obviously the
                    Spanish felt rather strongly that the Moroccans were taking advantage of Spain
                    at a moment when Franco was ill. They had all sorts of delegations, negotiations
                    involving people from the government, private emissaries. In any event this all
                    got by without any serious consequences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one operate in this? Here you are the American
                        Ambassador. You know we have had very close relations with Morocco since
                        1796 or something like that. You have this lurking suspicion that perhaps at
                        least somewhere within our government, by either CIA or military or
                        something, may be giving some underhand assistance there. Did you go back to
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: In something of this sort instructions were received from Washington. I
                    reported obviously what the Spanish were telling me and the conversations I had
                    had with the government, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Chief of
                    the Military Command, the Minister of the Army, etc. who all had this suspicion
                    that somehow we were involved. I was instructed, of course, to go in and tell
                    them that we were absolutely neutral in this thing. We had nothing to do with
                    it. It was hands off. We just didn't take sides.</p>
                <p>It was a little difficult because the Spanish felt that they had a right to some
                    support from us since this was, if you will, an aggressive act by the Moroccans.
                    It had not been brought about by any action of the Spanish. It was entirely a
                    Moroccan thing to take the Moroccans' minds off their local problems and the
                    Polisario who were the rebels supported by the Algerians who were trying to take
                    away some of the Moroccan territory. This was really, basically as I looked at
                    it, a move which was started entirely by the Moroccans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you at some point call in your station chief, CIA man,
                        and the defense attach� and say, “Now listen, are you sure there is no
                        monkey business going on?” Or in a way did you not want to call them
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>STABLER: I didn't, although in point of fact I had a daily staff meeting of all
                    the heads of sections which met in my office around 10:00 for the purposes of
                    finding out what was going on, and giving them my instructions of what I wanted
                    done. If it had been something that was a CIA operation, we wouldn't have been
                    told that. Maybe the station chief would have been told, but he would have been
                    told not to tell the Ambassador. In saying this, I don't say that I have any
                    fixed knowledge that we were involved except it seemed to me that shortly before
                    this began, Dick Walters, who at that point may still have been Deputy Director
                    of CIA, made a visit to Rabat. Whether it had anything to do with it or not, I
                    don't know. Whether the Spanish suspicions were founded, I do not know. They
                    couldn't come up with anything very specific. The only thing that they came up
                    with really was why was the American flag being carried in the Green March.</p>
                <p>I pointed out that it also might have been in the Moroccan interest to have it
                    appear that we were behind this. It would not have been too difficult to give
                    the flag to a Moroccan or whoever, and tell him to wave it so that the cameras
                    would pick it up. So I told them that I didn't think that was a very valid
                    point. I made very clear to them, as I was instructed to do, that their protests
                    were really groundless and this was not something that we had anything to do
                    with and that we were urging, as we usually do, tranquility and calm and
                    moderation.</p>
                <p>In any event, this was all overtaken by the death of Franco. It was one of these
                    things where there had been many reports that he had died, which proved not to
                    be true. One of them, for example, which I cite because it seems to me a good
                    object lesson of what should not be done.One afternoon there were reports around
                    town that he had died. I had checked these reports and touched base with a
                    number of people I had confidence in who had told me the reports were not true.
                    But the Defense Attach�, whom I had kept on—he had been the Army Attach� under
                    the previous Ambassador—came in to see me and said he had heard reports. I said
                    that I had heard them too but was absolutely certain that they were not correct
                    and therefore was not going to send a message. I thought I might, in due course,
                    telephone to tell Washington that the rumors were not true. He agreed and left
                    the room.</p>
                <p>I called the Assistant Secretary, Arthur Hartman, in Washington and told him that
                    there were a lot of rumors around and he may have seen tickers, etc., but I
                    could assure him they were not true. He said that he couldn't quite understand
                    this because he had just gotten from my Embassy a CRITIC message —which stops
                    everything...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Designed to report coups, deaths of chiefs of state,

                </p>
                <p>STABLER: It is the top, priority emergency message and gets distributed in a
                    flash around Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>He said that the message said that Franco had died. I said that I didn't know how
                    that could be because I certainly sent nothing and it is not true and I was
                    calling to tell him this.</p>
                <p>Well, after digging into this a little bit and asking my station chief to find
                    out for me what sort of message it was, it turned out that the Defense Attach�
                    had gone directly from my office, up to his office and had sent without any
                    authorization from anybody the CRITIC message saying that Franco had died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find this incredible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, it was incredible. It made me absolutely furious. I called him in
                    and ripped him over the coals and said that if he wasn't about to be leaving
                    anyway and retiring, he would be out of Madrid that night, because I would not
                    keep him. I made it clear that he would send a message to Washington and take
                    full responsibility for the telegram which he did without any authorization. He
                    did this. The Defense Department was rather angry with me for making him do it,
                    but I said that this was exactly the sort of thing that is intolerable in an
                    Embassy—someone who can send wires on his own.</p>
                <p>I think this is one of our great weaknesses that everyone from a different agency
                    has access to their own communications and can send any message they want on
                    their own.</p>
                <p>At one point CIA wanted me to agree to combine the State communication center in
                    Madrid with the CIA communications unit which would be run by the CIA. I
                    absolutely flatly refused. They said, “What, don't you trust us?” And I said,
                    “It isn't a question of trust. If I could be assured that I would see every
                    message going out of that communication center no matter what it was, I would
                    agree to it, but I will not agree to something where I do not have total control
                    over my communications and I do not want ever a situation to arise when I am
                    sending a message and am told it can't be sent because the station chief's
                    message takes priority.” So I said, “I refuse flatly. I will keep my State
                    Department communication and you keep yours. I am not going to have a situation
                    arise where the Ambassador's messages are put to one side.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the motivation of sending a CRITIC message?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: It was very clear to me what it was. He thought that he was getting a
                    scoop and he would be the one who scooped the Embassy by getting the message in
                    first. He was convinced that he was right, although he didn't say he disagreed
                    with me when I talked with him. But it was true, he went directly from my office
                    upstairs to send his message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he knew what would happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>STABLER: He thought he was right, but he wasn't. It was a very undisciplined
                    effort by him to gain glory. That was all there was to it, very simple. As I
                    say, if it hadn't been for the fact that he was leaving, I would have asked for
                    his removal at once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to him subsequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: He eventually left and retired. He was teaching somewhere in a college
                    somewhere in Pennsylvania. He was a very nice fellow, but I was terribly
                    disappointed to think that he would do something of that sort.</p>
                <p>I mentioned it because it just seems to be an object lesson in a way. You run an
                    embassy, you work...I did not ever agree to the use of country team in the
                    embassy because I didn't consider it a team. The Ambassador was the ambassador
                    and everyone worked for the ambassador. We had very close communications via
                    staff meetings, etc. But I didn't want anybody to feel in a sense, as this
                    fellow apparently did, that you are all part of a team and maybe there is a
                    primus inter pares but you are a team member and go and do your thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find this interesting because I served in embassies
                        where I was part of a country team, but it never occurred to me that we were
                        there to do other than contribute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, I wouldn't even let the name be used because I didn't really,
                    frankly, believe it was necessary. I will say this and I have talked about
                    Graham Martin and how difficult a person he was when Ambassador in Rome, there
                    were some things that I thought he was right about. He was the one who actually
                    used the term Diplomatic Mission and would not use the term of Country Team. I
                    thought he was right on that, so I copied him when I went to Madrid. And it
                    worked, I think it worked well. It wasn't that I was aloof because I had these
                    daily meetings with all the top members of the Mission and once a week a much
                    larger meeting involving section heads and all the peripheral people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason for having these larger meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: The larger meeting, once a week, was designed to bring in elements that
                    were in Madrid and had functions, but who were not strictly speaking part of the
                    Mission, such as the 16th Air Force and the Office of Special Intelligence of
                    the Air Force. This gave the possibility for these other elements to be plugged
                    in to some extent as to what we were doing. They very rarely offered any comment
                    of particular interest, but it was an opportunity for everybody to get
                    together.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Of the two I found the morning meeting most useful. We tried to keep it to no
                    more than 15 minutes. This was an opportunity for all the principal section
                    heads, including the head of MAAG -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to give an idea, who were the principal section
                        heads?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well there was the DCM, the political counselor, the economic counselor,
                    the political/military counselor, the consular counselor, the head of MAAG, the
                    Defense attach� and other military attach�s, and the station chief. At the
                    bigger meetings you added the FBI man, the Narcotics man, Agriculture, etc. At
                    that time the economic counselor also covered the commercial side of things,
                    otherwise there would have been the Commercial man as well.</p>
                <p>It was a way that I could then find out from them what they were doing and what
                    was going on; and then I could say what I was doing this and to give, my
                    guidance on how certain matters should be dealt with.. It was a very useful
                    coordinating tool and I think it worked well.</p>
                <p>Franco finally did die. I had been at a dinner party the night before. There were
                    some Franco relatives there. They were called to the telephone during dinner and
                    then disappeared. Well, one obviously couldn't ask what had happened, but I had
                    arranged with someone who was well plugged in to call me the minute that he
                    heard that Franco had died. About 4:30 or 5:00 the next morning I got a
                    telephone call from this friend who said the end had come. That ended this era.
                    I immediately informed Washington.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, the question was who was going to represent the United States at
                    the funeral. Because he was Franco, although there were a lot of people who
                    didn't want to come, there were many who wanted to. President Ford took quite
                    some time to decide. But they made the wise decision that they would appoint
                    Nelson Rockefeller, then Vice President, and me as the US representatives. In
                    spite of a lot of pressure the President and Kissinger wisely decided that they
                    were not going to make a circus out of this thing. They were going to limit it
                    to just two people.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Franco died on the 20th and I think the King's swearing in took place a couple of
                    days later. Rockefeller came right over. Then we had rather an amusing thing. In
                    the parliament building there was very limited space so it was agreed that only
                    the principal delegate from each nation would be allowed to come to the
                    parliament for the swearing in. I was rather indignant about the whole thing
                    because it seemed to me that I was not only delegate but Ambassador. A lot of my
                    colleagues were both Delegates and Ambassadors so they all could go. At one
                    point Mrs. Rockefeller thought she might want to go so I got two tickets for the
                    Vice President and Mrs. Rockefeller. When I said I was not able to go she
                    decided that perhaps she shouldn't go and I should take her ticket. So I did. Of
                    course the Spanish protocol people were upset. I was the only non-chief Delegate
                    Ambassador who had been able to attend. But I was determined that somehow I
                    would participate in this event.</p>
                <p>That went off very well. The King became King. There was no crowning. There was a
                    crown on a stool representing the monarchy, but he wasn't crowned, but sworn in.
                    He made a speech and I congratulated him on it and he said, “Yeah, but I wish
                    you could have heard my knees knocking.” Then, several days later there was the
                    formal funeral in front of the main royal palace in Madrid. To appease my
                    Spanish Protocol friends I agreed that I would not sit with Rockefeller, but
                    with my Ambassador colleagues. Afterwards we all drove out to the Valley of the
                    Fallen which was a huge underground basilica where many of the fallen in the
                    Civil War were buried, including a few of the Republicans, and, of course, the
                    main leaders of the Franco period. And that is where Franco was buried that
                    day.. Rockefeller was there, of course, for that. We both went to that. Others
                    there included Pinochet of Chile, King Hussein of Jordan. I might add that on
                    the way out with the Vice President and Mrs. Rockefeller in the Vice President's
                    car flying the American flag and his Vice Presidential flag, he was greeted
                    quite warmly by the crowds lining the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pinochet was President of Chile</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: King Hussein of Jordan was there and a lot of others. But most of the
                    European countries were represented by their ambassadors. We, obviously had a
                    special relationship with Spain because of the military facilities and that is
                    why Rockefeller came.</p>
                <p>Rockefeller stayed on during the week. The next event was a week later. It was to
                    be the King's Day—a mass at the Los Geronimos Cathedral in Madrid, at which many
                    foreign delegations would come, including Prince Philip of the UK and a lot of
                    the European royalty and leaders who were acknowledging that there was a new
                    Spain after Franco's death. During the week before the King's Day I didn't see
                    much of Rockefeller because he wanted to be left alone. He and his wife went on
                    their usual buying sprees. He was a compulsive buyer and bought everything in
                    sight, not one but dozens of them. My wife and I did have lunch with him and
                    Mrs. Rockefeller one day, but that was it.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Then came the King's Day and we went to the Cathedral. The Cardinal of Madrid,
                    Cardinal Tarancon. who was quite a liberal Cardinal...at one time Franco support
                    depended on the Catholic Church, the military and the wealthy class. The wealthy
                    class and military remained supporters, but the Church had begun to change and
                    take strong exception to the dictatorial form of government. At this service
                    Cardinal Tarancon delivered a homily which was nothing short of a political
                    statement. It was quite democratic and liberal in terms of what had been going
                    on. I mention this because I was very much interested that after the service,
                    Rockefeller, who was always regarded by some as being fairly liberal, was
                    absolutely aghast to think that the Cardinal had given such a liberal homily. I
                    think those who thought Rockefeller was a liberal were perhaps rather wrong.
                    Basically he was very conservative.</p>
                <p>Then we went on from there to the Royal Palace - the Palacio de Oriente, as it
                    was called. There was a big function there. It was amusing because, of course,
                    I, as a Delegate went into the part of the Palace where the foreign delegations
                    were—Prince Philip, royalty from Liechtenstein, everywhere—(I must say that I
                    discovered there that Prince Philip has a good sense of humor. He was very funny
                    talking about various things in Spain and what not.) Rockefeller and I stood
                    together. After the King and Queen came in and greeted each one of us, I went
                    scooting through various back ways of the Palace, which is a very big one, to
                    another part of the Palace where the King and Queen were receiving ambassadors
                    accredited to Spain. So I took my place there, and when they came by they did a
                    double take and said, “Haven't we just seen you some place else?” It was quite
                    an occasion and the Spanish did it extremely well. It was a joyful moment when
                    the King took over, although at that point no one really knew where this was
                    going to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Franco death watch, and during the period when
                        the King took over but was obviously the new boy on the block, etc., what
                        were you looking at? Were you looking at the army, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I had felt long prior to Franco's death that there was a tendency in
                    Spain to move towards an updated concept in the political system and the
                    recognition by a great deal of the younger people that Spain had to move on and
                    catch up in the 20th century to where a lot of other countries were and had been
                    for many, many years. It was also fairly clear to me that the creation by Franco
                    of a middle class in Spain had brought about a rather moderate attitude. There
                    were a lot of people who had made great improvements in their standard of living
                    and didn't want anything to happen that would interfere with that.</p>
                <p>I also had come to recognize that the military as such was a fairly disciplined
                    group and probably would not take any action on their own. And then it was also
                    clear to me from talking with Juan Carlos, as Prince before, that he was on the
                    right track with all this and it was likely that the transition would go
                    peacefully.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>So one was in very close touch with the King, with the government, with leaders
                    who were coming into the new government. For example, before the new government
                    under the King was announced, I went to see Count Motrico, who had been Spanish
                    Ambassador to Washington, and who had been in almost every part of the political
                    spectrum at one time or another, was regarded as a mild opposition to Franco. It
                    wasn't very severe. He had been, after all, Franco's Mayor of Bilbao, and
                    Ambassador to Washington. I went to see him and he gave me the list pretty much
                    of people who were going to be ministers in the new government. He became
                    Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>Now Juan Carlos did the intelligent thing. He kept Franco's Prime Minister, Arias
                    Navarro, as the Prime Minister. He did not want to oust Arias immediately
                    because he did not seek a confrontation with the loyal Franquistas which would
                    cause a great upheaval. But he brought people in who had been somewhat in
                    opposition to Franco, such as the Count of Motrico, Jos� Maria Areilza.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The King, by the way, under the former government could
                        form the cabinet. It wasn't a parliamentary democracy as such.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: He was Chief of State. All of Franco's Organic laws were still in force.
                    So the Chief of State could appoint the government—the Prime Minister, and see
                    to it that the right people were brought into the cabinet. And he brought in a
                    number of younger men who were more modern, if you will, in their approach. The
                    people believed nothing had changed because here was Arias Navarro, the Minister
                    of the Army was the same, etc. Therefore, what had changed? It was just a
                    continuation.</p>
                <p>But it was a clear strategy to not upset the apple cart right away and there was
                    a lot of nostalgia for Franco who, after all, had been around for a long time -
                    forty years. So throwing everybody out on the street would have been more than
                    the traffic could bear.</p>
                <p>My object in this period...and let me say here that in those situations, you
                    don't get instructions as to what to do. You pretty much do what you think
                    should be done and tell Washington what you are doing. But no one says you
                    should go in and do this or that. My effort in all this was to encourage
                    democratic elements in playing the game and trying to persuade those people who
                    had been strong opposition to Franco, the Christian Democrats, the Socialists,
                    not to try to force the issue to the point of throwing everything out and making
                    a new beginning. And not go through a period when nothing was on the table as
                    you try to write a new constitution. Not to turn the thing into a trauma. It was
                    important to believe that the King was going in this direction and to play the
                    game along with him and not to rock the boat in the extreme sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>And, of course, we did what I mentioned to you before regarding the facility
                    negotiations. When Kissinger met with Foreign Minister Areilza in Paris in
                    December, 1975, we disagree to the treaty and things of that sort so that it
                    would demonstrate that the United States was backing the new government. The
                    whole aspect of this was really to support the King and the forces that wanted
                    to change the system in Spain, but to change it gradually and in a rational way.
                    I mentioned to you earlier that part of this was the negotiation of the Treaty,
                    part of it clearly was inviting the King to make a State Visit to Washington in
                    June, 1976.</p>
                <p>And, of course, an extremely important part of this process also was the support,
                    advice, counsel, etc. that came from the Europeans who felt that with Franco
                    gone it was a new situation and that some of these new parties should be
                    supported. As you know, there are the various political foundations,
                    particularly in Germany, representing the different political
                    parties........</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Each one representing...the CDU, the SPD .........</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Then there was another one the name of which I can't remember the, a
                    liberal one. They had representatives in Madrid and a lot of money passed
                    through those people to help the various political parties. Willy Brandt was
                    very helpful in terms of the Socialist Party in trying to convince the
                    Socialists not to do anything drastic. The Christian Democrats were sort of at
                    sixes and sevens. Even today they don't have much of a role in Spain.</p>
                <p>It was interesting because one of the leaders of the Christian Democrats, Ruiz
                    Jimenez, had been Franco's Ambassador to the Vatican. He had even been Minister
                    of Education under Franco. Then he went totally in opposition and, of course,
                    those parties were legally banned.</p>
                <p>So this was my main preoccupation to support the elements that wanted to move
                    towards a democratic system. The King's speech before the US Congress was all
                    aimed at that. I mentioned my role in that. It really went, I think, quite
                    smoothly.</p>
                <p>The King recognized, of course, that he couldn't go on for very long without
                    dismissing Arias Navarro. He was a very nice man but had also been a Minister of
                    the Interior, in charge of the secret police and the security police in Spain.
                    It was in the air that the King had to make a change. He called Arias Navarro to
                    the Royal Palace in Madrid and, I think, totally shocked him by telling him that
                    he was finished. It was a courageous thing to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>It was unknown before that he was going to be called in so a new Prime Minister
                    hadn't been designated. It was rather amusing that I had separate visits from
                    three or four gentlemen, each one of whom thought he was going to be named Prime
                    Minister - each one assuring me of that fact. One was a man who had Christian
                    Democratic leanings although he had not been a member of the Christian
                    Democratic Party as such. Another was former Foreign Minister Areilza. I was
                    quite sure that none of them would be Prime Minister, but they thought so.</p>
                <p>Much to everybody's surprise came the appointment of Adolfo Suarez, who had been
                    in the new government, although at the moment I can't remember exactly what he
                    was doing. He was young, he had no background in democracy whatsoever. I talked
                    to him many times. He had no particular grounding. He came up the ladder as a
                    functionary of the Franco party - the Falange. But he was young, attractive
                    looking. He obviously got along well with the King, the King liked him and the
                    King picked him out of the young element and made him the Prime Minister. It
                    came, as I say, as a great surprise to most people. I had a call from someone in
                    the Palace while I was having the 4th of July reception, telling me that the new
                    Prime Minister had been chosen. They wouldn't tell me the name, merely that it
                    was someone that I knew and somebody who was an insider and I would probably
                    like it.Then the King in July, 1976, about a month after returning from the
                    States, took the occasion to shuffle the thing around. Some of these people who
                    had thought they would be Prime Ministers found themselves with no jobs at all.
                    My friend Areilza wasn't anything. His Under Secretary, Marcelino Oreja became
                    Foreign Minister. He was a young fellow, also with Christian Democratic
                    tendencies.</p>
                <p>All of these people were part of the. democratic element and I mentioned this
                    before. When Suarez took over it became clear that eventually there would have
                    to be an election, certainly within a year's time, even though the new
                    constitution hadn't been written. So Suarez and all his friends created the
                    Union of the Democratic Center - the UCD -which was a collection of people from
                    all walks of life, but who were not the nostalgics, who believed in the
                    consolidation of a democratic state. The there was the Alianza Popular which was
                    creation of Manuel Fraga who had been Minister of Interior in the first
                    government of the King. He created this rather right wing party. Then there were
                    the Socialists who had social-democratic tendencies, but who were regarded by
                    many with deep suspicion as a stalking horse for the communists. On the far left
                    there were the communists led by Santiago Carillo who had, with official but
                    unacknowledged concurrence, been allowed to reenter Spain sub rosa after years
                    spent in exile. The center party became quite important because as we went
                    towards elections, there was a strong feeling that the Socialists were going to
                    do extremely well and this frightened lots of people. So lots of people in this
                    right wing party of Alianza Popular voted with the Union of the Democratic
                    Center out of fear that somehow the Socialists might get in. And the Socialists
                    were regarded as the nemesis of all the vested interests in Spain because they
                    had been associated with the communists during the Civil War and were considered
                    basically the enemy. So that's what happened in the elections of 1977—the Union
                    of the Democratic Center won a landslide majority.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>About this time, or just before the elections took place, the decision had to be
                    made as to what to do about the Communist Party. The Government decided that it
                    simply couldn't declared nonexistent a certain element of the population. So
                    they waited until Good Friday, when all of Spain ceases to function for a whole
                    week, the military and other public opinion leaders go out of town, papers do
                    not publish, etc. They selected that moment to legalize the Communist Party to
                    try to reduce to the extent possible the outcry of some parts of the press and
                    military, etc. It really work remarkably well because by the time some of these
                    people got back into town the thing had been done and there was no time to
                    organize anything. So the Communist Party was legalized.The Prime Minister asked
                    me once at a long lunch I had with him before he went to Washington about the
                    whole thing. I said, “I suppose officially speaking I would have to say that we
                    don't approve of the Communist Party, we don't like them and don't think they
                    should play any role. But if you ask me privately, I would say that it was the
                    only thing that you could do. You could not declare them nonexistent and
                    therefore you did the right thing because you minimized the dramatic effect by
                    legalizing them. If you had banned them you would have made a crisis out of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>But this Union of the Democratic Center was a bastard type of organization. It
                    had all sorts of people in it. They tried to structure it as a regular party and
                    ultimately, after my time, it fell apart. The Socialists came in and that was
                    that.</p>
                <p>This was a fascinating period to be there because to watch a country that has
                    been almost 40 years under a dictatorship gradually turn itself into basically a
                    very successful democracy is, from a professional point of view, a fascinating
                    thing to watch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are so used to dealing with the exact opposite.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Exactly. So the creation of a monarchy to boot was quite astounding.</p>
                <p>During the early period I was involved rather heavily in all of this. I do not
                    mean to suggest that I was writing constitutions and that sort of thing, no. But
                    trying to encourage this process. Trying to facilitate it. Trying to keep us
                    from being too much in bed with one group, which I wasn't always very successful
                    in because of the strange way we do business in Washington. And supporting this
                    whole process in one form or another...through visits, the Leader Grant program
                    and that type of thing which was useful.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>As time went on it was quite clear to me that my particular role in this was
                    coming to an end. It is never very desirable in these situations to have a
                    terribly close involvement of the American Ambassador in these things. We had
                    situations where when Suarez was Prime Minister I was in Washington on
                    consultation and the word came to me that the Station Chief wanted to have
                    direct contact with the Prime Minister and understood that the Prime Minister
                    would like to have regular contact with him. I went to see whoever was head of
                    CIA at that point, Stansfield Turner I think it was, and said absolutely not. I
                    was not going to have the situation where we had two channels into the Prime
                    Minister. There was no reason for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is also dangerous. All of this comes out later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Also in our system where the CIA chief can do things and write messages
                    which he doesn't have to show to the Ambassador you lose control. To my
                    knowledge it never occurred. He didn't like it, but I made it clear that this
                    was not to be. If they thought they were going to do this then I was going to
                    resign. I just think that it is a very awkward situation. We had no Spanish
                    programs in Spain. I could see from the Prime Minister's point of view that he
                    wouldn't mind that sort of thing, having little back channels and so forth.</p>
                <p>You get to a situation in this type of setup where eventually one party believes
                    that you are being unfriendly to them and too friendly to the other party. And
                    that began to be the situation. Suarez began to feel that I was being too
                    friendly to the Socialists, and the Socialists thought I was being too friendly
                    with Suarez.</p>
                <p>As 1977 rolled along I felt that I had probably done all that I could do and was
                    beginning to spend an awful lot of time fighting with bureaucracy in Washington.
                    I was getting very tired of it. There comes a point where if you are spending
                    most of your time trying to get Washington to do things, to focus on things, a
                    sort of diminishing returns set in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, personnel for one thing. Secondly there was one rather difficult
                    case involving a contract we had with the Spanish through the Defense Department
                    and, I think, General Electric, to establish a whole communications network for
                    them for their military, a sort of command control structure which they didn't
                    have and contracted with us, involving quite a bit of money, to do. We didn't do
                    it very well. It didn't pass any of its tests. We kept charging more money and
                    the thing became intolerable. I got thoroughly involved in it. Just the business
                    of trying to get the Department and the Pentagon to focus on the damage that
                    this was causing us was absolutely monumental. It was the type of thing that
                    drove me wild because I couldn't get anybody to focus on it and take seriously
                    what it was that we were doing and where we were wrong. We documented it in
                    every way and eventually they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>The Department imposed personnel appointments on me which had no reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Madrid is one of those places where you send either lower
                        level or politically connected people. The cultural officer who is a friend
                        of so and so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: We didn't have much of that really. But for instance, I wanted a certain
                    person who spoke Spanish for my political counselor and had thrust upon me a man
                    who spoke excellent Mandarin and had been in the National Security Council who
                    had no more reason to be in Spain than the man in the moon, except that they had
                    to park him somewhere. It was quite clear that they were only going to leave him
                    there for a short time and this was purely parking. I objected to that but was
                    told that this was going to be it. So he came and he wasn't very good. I got
                    tired of that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>So eventually I told George Vest, Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, that
                    come 1978 I thought I would be quite prepared to move on. As it turned out, of
                    course, I probably would have moved on anyway because then they had to find a
                    job for Terry Todman, who was then Assistant Secretary for American Republic
                    Affairs and who had fallen afoul of the Carter Administration over his, I
                    believe, decision not in some cases to make the human rights thing a make or
                    break issue. Other things have to be considered too. But he was considered
                    rather weak on that so they decided that they wanted to get rid of him. Spain
                    was in the cards as I would have been there for three years. I had gone back to
                    Washington in '77 and thought that the thing to do was to call on the Secretary
                    Vance and was told by the staff that he couldn't possibly see me. I went to see
                    Phil Habib, who was then Under Secretary for Political Affairs, and talked to
                    him about some of the things that were going on in Spain and he said I should
                    see the Secretary. I said that I had tried to but was told no way. He simply
                    picked up the phone and said to the Secretary's Assistant, “You make an
                    appointment for Ambassador Stabler.” It was to be on a Saturday. I was called
                    Saturday morning and was told that the Secretary was preparing to go to Moscow
                    and there was no way he could see me. So I called Phil Habib and told him the
                    situation. He said I had to see him. He called back in ten minutes and said,
                    “The Secretary will see you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is sort of the gatekeeper complex.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, the gatekeeper complex—You are an Ambassador so what is important
                    about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>And there were certain things. There were things about the visit of the Prime
                    Minister that was coming along, there were things about the base negotiations,
                    there were a variety of things that had to be discussed. And also what were
                    their plans for me, which I think I had every right to have some idea about.</p>
                <p>So finally I went in to see Vance and had a good talk with him. He said they
                    would like to have me stay on for another year—this being in '77. So that was
                    about it—I left just about a year later.</p>
                <p>In the first few months of 1978 Frank Church, a Democratic Senator from Idaho,
                    who was about to become Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
                    decided he wanted to come to Spain. He had been invited by the Basques, there
                    were a lot of Basques in Idaho, to come to Bilbao, which was a very important
                    part of the Basque country—big industrial center up there—for the ceremonies
                    which were being permitted for the first time celebrating Basque national day.
                    In Franco's day it was absolutely banned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because there was a very strong Basque separatist
                        movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Very strong Basque separatist movement with a terrorist
                    organization.</p>
                <p>But this was to be a civic, civil ceremony in Bilbao and Church had been asked to
                    come to it. When I heard this I called Church and said, “Frank, please come to
                    Madrid first. The government is very sensitive to all these things. While this
                    ceremony is officially sanctioned, Madrid still is the capital and the
                    government is there. Even though it is a new government, they are sensitive to
                    anything that appears to delegate from the authority of the central government.
                    So please come to Madrid first.” He said, “I understand that and I will. I am
                    glad that you told me. I will come to Madrid first and then go up Basque
                    country.”</p>
                <p>Well, that was the time that the Panama Canal Treaty was being negotiated in the
                    Senate and Church was very much involved with it. He was held up and had to go
                    to Bilbao first. I had an appointment for him to see Foreign Minister Oreja.
                    When I had heard that he was going to Bilbao first, I called up the Foreign
                    Office and said, “This has happened. He was going to come to Madrid first, but
                    he has been held up. He has got to go to Bilbao, but I want to make sure that
                    everything is still in order and we still have the appointment.” I was told
                    there was no problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>So he went to Bilbao and then gave an interview to the press which was very
                    innocuous and not unfriendly to the central government. He arrived in Madrid and
                    we drove down to the Foreign Office. We sat in the antechamber; we waited; we
                    waited 10 minutes; we waited 15 minutes. Finally I got up and said that I wanted
                    to know what was going on here. They came in to me and said that they were sorry
                    but I didn't have an appointment with the Foreign Minister. I said, “Now, wait a
                    minute. I went all through this and was told that the appointment had been
                    confirmed. No one had called me to tell me it had been called off. We came down
                    here and this is an enormous insult. I will see to it that my displeasure is
                    reflected.”</p>
                <p>We returned to the Embassy and I called the Foreign Minister and couldn't get
                    him. Then I called the Under Secretary and absolutely lashed into him. At this
                    point I had also been told that the Prime Minister would not see Church. So I
                    called a man who was very close to the King and who had absolutely direct access
                    to him whenever he wanted it. I said, “Here is this man who is going to be
                    Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate. You
                    want friends there. You are just in the process of making an enemy of somebody
                    who will never forget this sort of high-handed rude insulting treatment, not
                    only to him but also to me as the American Ambassador. I am frankly extremely
                    displeased with this thing. The only way to save it is if the King sees this
                    Senator.”</p>
                <p>It wasn't 15 minutes later before this fellow called me and said that the King
                    was very upset by what happened. He was extremely annoyed and would, of course,
                    receive Senator Church. Frank Church was, I must say, very good about the whole
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was politically savvy about understanding...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: He understood what was going on. He understood what I said to him about
                    coming to Madrid first. He realized what I was trying to do to rescue the
                    situation. He did what I asked him to do.</p>
                <p>So we went to the King. The King apologized for this. Later I understood he
                    ticked off both the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister for their behavior.
                    Everything went off very well. Then I had a call from the Foreign Minister
                    saying that he was sorry things hadn't worked out, etc. He asked if Mr. Church
                    would come to see him at his residence. Well, I said, “I don't know, I will have
                    to see if he will or won't.” I told Church this and said, “Obviously we mustn't
                    play their game. We must go down to see them and not give them the satisfaction
                    of refusing to see them because that plays into their hands.” So we went down
                    and it was all right.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>They were foolish, overly sensitive to the Basque business. Of course, they have
                    had some terrible times with the Basque business. My very good friend, the Duke
                    of Veragua whose real name in life was Cristobal Colon or Christopher Columbus,
                    was assassinated by the Basques. He was an admiral in the Spanish navy and they
                    made a mistake thinking he was somebody else and assassinated him. A lot of
                    people were killed unnecessarily.</p>
                <p>It was this sort of thing, the Church episode led one to believe that Suarez had
                    been there too long. He had hung on too long. He was finally dropped by the
                    King, I think before I left, and a new man Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, was put in.
                    That may have happened actually after I left.</p>
                <p>I left in May, 1978. When I heard that Todman was coming I told George Vest that
                    as far as I was concerned I would stay for another month, I wasn't going to wait
                    forever for him to come. I would just as soon go.</p>
                <p>At that time the Union of Democratic Center was still in power with Leopoldo
                    Calvo Sotelo who actually had become secretary of the party before that and who
                    had been in the first government of the King as Minister of Commerce. He had
                    been an industrialist in Spain and well connected. A member of the somewhat
                    privileged group. But then things began to disintegrate in terms of this Union
                    Democratic Center. When the constitution was written which was completed in
                    December 1978, there were elections in the spring of 1979 under the new
                    constitution. The Socialists won hands down and have been in power ever
                    since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the elements, before we leave Spain, you mention
                        that the wealthy class were one of the pillars of the Franco regime. This is
                        also a problem for an ambassador and embassy. I mean this group can over
                        embrace you and all. They have the money, the social know how and end all.
                        It is very easy to become captive of them. Did you have a problem with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I didn't have a problem with that because I spent really a lot of time
                    on the political side. One had to keep in touch with them, no question about it.
                    I met them all shortly after I arrived in Madrid. The American Ambassador was a
                    personality and these people were used to knowing the Ambassador and they were
                    all very friendly. I must say we had a lot of good friends amongst this group
                    which were by no means parasites. They were hard working people. But they had
                    made a lot of money. They had been given various facilities and income tax was
                    not very great and they had prospered well under Franco.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Franco had reintroduced into Spain the nobility which is a very complicated thing
                    in Spain and taken very seriously. The book of peerage is a huge thing...and
                    there are different degrees. You have dukes, marquesses, counts, viscounts,
                    barons, who are Grandees of Spain. and you have the same titles, except for
                    dukes, who are not grandees. All dukes are automatically Grandees. So you have
                    someone who is a marquess who is a grandee and one who is not a grandee, the one
                    who is a grandee sits ahead of the one who isn't. There are lots of Spanish
                    nobles. That had been facilitated by Franco and played an important part. As you
                    know, Franco was a monarchist and it was his decision that he would be succeeded
                    by a King.</p>
                <p>Under those circumstances one must never allow oneself to be captured by any
                    particular group. When one entertained in the early days that I was there, you
                    entertained the power structure. You could not entertain the power structure of
                    any banned political party, that simply didn't work. If you tried to have Felipe
                    Gonzalez, which you wouldn't dream of doing, with the Duke of Veragua or
                    somebody, it simply wouldn't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Felipe Gonzalez was at that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Leader of the Socialist Party, which was illegal. They didn't know any
                    of these people and it would have been a scandal. You would have had an illegal
                    politician with a member of the establishment. Now, interestingly enough, when
                    Franco died and new government came in, we began to have functions where you
                    would have some of these people and some of the political people. You would have
                    a useless duchess or something, but you would have people who had an interest in
                    what was going on in Spain. They were fascinated in meeting some of these people
                    on the political spectrum they had never, ever laid eyes on before. Sometimes
                    that worked very well.</p>
                <p>But I spent a great deal of time in getting to know the political and the
                    economic side as well as the intellectual side, although to a lesser extent
                    because they didn't play any particular role, curiously enough, in the
                    development of the society. But some of the intellectual people who had been
                    exiled during the Franco period and came back, people of that sort, I made a
                    particular point of meeting as they presented a different approach to the
                    situation. They were not sort of the element that had supported Franco. The
                    Franco period when I was there for me only lasted until March, 1975 to November,
                    1975, and then it began to develop into the new thing. So by the time that I
                    left you had a whole new structure. You had had elections, although under the
                    old laws because the constitution had not been finished. Some new people were
                    coming into this picture. People who had been exiled. The King had the power to
                    appoint a number of royal senators to take into account some of the people who
                    were distinguished in life and many who had been exiled who then came into the
                    picture that way. So you had an opening of the situation. A whole new element
                    had come in which made it more interesting. So, of course, it was essential to
                    try to keep in touch with all these people the best one could.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a rather bizarre story told me by Jack Binns, who
                        was DCM under Tom Enders, about an American woman who was married to a
                        count, Count Romanones who tried to destabilize Enders because she thought
                        she might even get the job. Do you know anything about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well, I knew Aileen very well. Aileen Romanones came to Madrid during
                    WWII, possibly in 1940 or thereabouts. She came from a small little town in New
                    York State. She was a secretary in the OSS Office in Madrid. A very pretty, tall
                    woman. She got around Madrid society. She fell in love with a grandee, Count
                    Romanones, who was a very wealthy person and who apparently had other sexual
                    preferences. His father said to Aileen when she was going to marry him, “You
                    understand about my son, don't you?”</p>
                <p>She had built up over a period of time a position in Madrid and all the nobility.
                    She had an attractive house in Madrid, a lovely place out in the western part of
                    Spain - the Extramadura - a beautiful house down in the Costa del Sol. She made
                    it her business to know people and when we arrived, we were immediately asked to
                    quite a few things. I have to say it was very helpful because she knew all the
                    power structure of the Franco regime and in a very short period of time...mind
                    you I arrived in March and had Ford arriving in May so it was essential for me
                    to know who the players were. Through her and these dinner parties and so forth
                    I met a huge number of the principal players in the Franco regime, including
                    Franco's daughter, granddaughter and people like that.</p>
                <p>As time went on, of course, the situation changed. She had a little problem
                    making the transition because she was closely linked with the Franco power
                    structure. Then she became very friendly with the Alianza Popular, Fraga's
                    thing. She would come over here and give lectures and talk to right wing
                    organizations here in Washington. Then she began to find it amusing to meet some
                    of the new breed of political people. She was very much the figure of the ancien
                    regime, but she found it amusing at political salons to gradually meet some of
                    these other people who had been out of the political picture because they had
                    been banned and got to know a number of these type. I am sure she met Gonzalez
                    and others in the political spectrum.</p>
                <p>She knew Todman. I don't suppose she was of much use to him. Don't forget that by
                    that time the new Spain was well on its way. The Socialists were in power and
                    she was less relevant. She would come over to this country and made a lot of
                    money going around the rubber chicken circuit giving lectures about the American
                    wife of the Spanish count. In Peoria this beautiful woman with all her emeralds
                    describing the life of Spain and her part in it was fascinating. She got
                    involved a bit in the political thing too on the right wing, the Alianza Popular
                    side. She has written a couple of books which most people agree are highly
                    fictional, although they claim to be real, about her exploits in the OSS,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>I can't answer the question specifically as to whether or not she tried to
                    destabilize Enders. I just don't know. He may not have paid much attention to
                    her.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he was warned not to, or something like that
                        before he went to Madrid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I think that may have been right. If I had been talking to someone going
                    to Madrid at that time I would have said to meet her but then steer clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: According to the story she tried to absorb him very
                        quickly into her social group before he got his feet on the ground. He cut
                        that off. But she had a direct line to Nancy Reagan and enmity was built
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: That I have heard. And I have heard that Enders basically left Madrid
                    because Nancy wanted him to. It certainly was true that Aileen Romanones was at
                    the White House quite frequently under the Reagans. I don't doubt that that
                    might have been a true story. But I think that Tom Enders did absolutely the
                    right thing and anybody in their right mind would not have permitted themselves
                    to be consumed in this manner.</p>
                <p>When I first went to Madrid it was just the opposite way around. It was extremely
                    useful for me to meet the Romanones. As time went on one saw less and less of
                    Aileen. She had become decreasingly relevant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is very interesting because it helps show
                        social life for an ambassador is not social life. It is a working function
                        and quite rightly so and you have to figure out how goes the social play as
                        far as whom you meet, the influence you have, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Yes, that is about it and I think you have to be very careful to balance
                    it. When I first went there a lot of these people...the sort of social, social
                    people...had a role and one, therefore, couldn't ignore them. You didn't want to
                    antagonize them, but it didn't mean you had to climb in bed with them. But you
                    did include them, and you did have dinner parties. But as time went on it became
                    less relevant.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>I had an interesting thing that came up and made a decision which I know was the
                    right one, although I am sure some of the Spanish didn't like it. I had a lunch
                    or dinner, whatever, after the election, the first popular election, where
                    people were elected to the parliament representing a constituency rather than a
                    particular walk of life or organization as in the Franco days. When one had a
                    function you had members of parliament and then maybe a grandee or two, people
                    who had some function and were not just grandee do nothings. Well my protocol
                    person said that the grandee had to be put first. I said, “Absolutely not. I am
                    going to establish a new thing. You have an elected member of parliament and
                    quite honestly I think he rates being the top of the heap.” So I did it. Certain
                    eyebrows were raised, but then of course, it became fairly normal, that was what
                    was done.</p>
                <p>I think any ambassador in a situation which has been fluid has to keep changing
                    with it and adapt to the new thing. At no point should one ever allow oneself to
                    be regarded as a captive of a group. It is sometimes unfortunate when you are
                    regarded by one group as being too friendly with the other group, if the other
                    group thinks the same thing. It means that you are in the center.</p>
                <p>I was told, for example, that my immediate successor was regarded as being
                    unfriendly to the Socialists. I don't know why they hold that. But his successor
                    then passed the word along that the Socialist Prime Minister had said to
                    Todman's successor, “Oh, let's get rid of this fellow.” What is true there?</p>
                <p>In any event, I put this in because I think that the one thing that an ambassador
                    should not do under any circumstances is to speak ill of his predecessor. I
                    think it is a cardinal sin. You can simply say you don't know. But don't spread
                    stories about a person, it doesn't help.</p>
                <p>I think that the Binns tale is fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1978 and were looking for another
                        assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Before I left Secretary of State Vance came to Madrid to attend the
                    biannual session of the US-Spanish Council which was set up under the new
                    treaty. Before he left I had an occasion to have a walk with him during which he
                    said, “Would you be interested in Venezuela as an Embassy?” I said, “That is
                    very interesting because I spent quite a few years of my life growing up there.”
                    I indicated that I would be interested, although I had pretty much made up my
                    mind that I was going to retire. I had been in for 37 years and I wanted to
                    spend more time at home with the children, etc. But I didn't tell him that at
                    the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>I came home in May, 1978 and in talking with the Director General he indicated
                    that there was no embassy available at the present time. However, he offered
                    Political Adviser in Norfolk or the Inspection Corps. I said that I wasn't
                    interested in either and would probably retire. Then I was asked to help do the
                    lobbying on the Hill for the removal of the arms embargo on Turkey. That went
                    back to my days in 1974, the Cyprus issue.</p>
                <p>Somewhere during this time which may have been August, I had a call from the
                    Director General who said that they were doing a list up for possible
                    ambassadors for Venezuela and that the Secretary had wished my name to be
                    included on the list. I told him to thank the Secretary very much, but I didn't
                    want my name on the list, I was going to retire. At that particular point they
                    produced the State Department budget which had in it the provision for the high
                    one retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The high one meant that instead of basing your pension on
                        the three highest years it would be on the highest year. The idea was to
                        encourage people to retire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: I decided that I would take advantage of that but didn't set any
                    particular date because it was there. Then, as you remember, the White House had
                    to sign it, although they didn't like it. The minute it became law the White
                    House started with Congress to produce another bill that rescinded it. One
                    Friday afternoon, October 15, 1978 at 5:00 I received a call from Personnel
                    saying that it looked as if the President was going to sign into law the
                    provision rescinding the high one sometime Saturday morning and that I should
                    retire in half an hour. So I said, “All right, consider me retired at 5:30.” The
                    President did sign the law. There wasn't a very large group but we hired an
                    attorney because the question was, having rescinded the high one could it be
                    retroactive or not. After a long period of time Justice finally rendered a
                    decision that once the President had signed the original high one law it became
                    an entitlement and could not be rescinded by a subsequent law.</p>
                <p>So I retired as of October 15, 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this has been an absolutely fascinating series of
                        interviews Mr. Ambassador and I really appreciate this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STABLER: Well I have enjoyed talking about this. I am sure there are probably
                    lots of things I have left out, but to recreate some of these things off the top
                    of my head is sometimes difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is an excellent series of interviews.</hi>

                <p>STABLER: I think there are probably many other things that went on in Spain, but
                    I think I have covered the principal areas. I will just add that professionally
                    it was rewarding to see a country move the way it did. My feeling was that when
                    the first government came in democracy in Spain wouldn't be consolidated until
                    you reached the situation when you could alternate majorities. I thought that to
                    me the greatest vignette of a changed Spain was when a Socialist Prime Minister
                    took an oath of office in front of the King with a table which had a crucifix on
                    it. That summed up the whole thing. Now the only problem, not in my time, of
                    course, is that the Socialists have been in power for 12 years and there doesn't
                    seem to be a valid alternative at the moment. So that is another problem.</p>
