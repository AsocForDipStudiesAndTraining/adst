                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 19, 1995. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Edward M. Rowell. It is being done on behalf of the Association
                        for Diplomatic Studies, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Ed, the best way to start is at the beginning. Can you tell me when and where you
                    were born, as well as something about your family?</p>
                <p>ROWELL: I was born in Oakland, California, on October 13, 1931. My father was a
                    Ph. D. candidate at the time at the University of California in Berkeley. He had
                    been born in San Francisco, California. My grandfather had been born in San
                    Francisco. My great grandfather had arrived in San Francisco in 1857, as a
                    missionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God! There weren't many of them there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. So I come from a missionary family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's field of study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Labor economics. In fact, he was on the staff of someone who dealt with
                    the west coast longshoremen's strike in the mid 1930s —1935 or 1936.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry Bridges and company.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Right. One of my father's first real jobs was with the US Department of
                    Agriculture in the Farm Security Administration. He traveled often to the
                    migratory labor camps, and as a child I remember spending endless days at the
                    railroad station watching the trains come and go. Trains fascinated me. One time
                    my father took me to a couple of the migratory labor camps that John Steinbeck
                    wrote about in The Grapes of Wrath. So when I got older and read Steinbeck,
                    there was something in it that struck me directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Well, he was in a field that was extremely important,
                        particularly during your formative or very early years in the Depression of
                        the 1930's. You saw the “Arkies” people from Arkansas who had migrated to
                        California and the “Okies” similar people from Oklahoma who had migrated to
                        California coming in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I remember my father telling me about people dying in public libraries —
                    dying of starvation. I also remember the first time I saw a paper dollar. I must
                    have been about six years old, and my father had brought it home as a curiosity
                    to show to the family. Till then, all dollars in my experience were silver. We
                    assumed some “foreigner” from the eastern United States had brought it to
                    California..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: California was the last state to accept...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: California and Nevada. This paper dollar was quite an item. We displayed
                    it at the house for several weeks. [Laughter] Anyway, I guess that I must have
                    been about eight or nine years old when my father took a job in Washington, DC.
                    We were there for one year and went back to California. We lived in California
                    another year, then returned to Washington for about two and one-half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War II had started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The war started while we were in Washington. We went back to Berkeley,
                    California again in 1942 at Thanksgiving time in November. In 1944 my father's
                    name came up in the draft. He turned out to have an enlarged heart and was
                    rejected for military service. The State Department immediately offered him a
                    position, which he took, as one of the first three Labor Attach�s the US ever
                    had. So my family and I all went off to Brazil. I attended the American School
                    in Rio De Janeiro from roughly June or July, 1944, till November, 1947, when I
                    went back to California and lived with my grandmother. She lived in what was
                    then a small, rural town east of Berkeley named Lafayette. Today Lafayette is a
                    San Francisco suburb.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>At the time I was there, the really big thing was for a kid was to be either on a
                    football team or in an auto shop and to wear the “uniform” — blue jeans and
                    T-shirts. Nobody had any money, and nobody cared. Life was golden. I finished at
                    the rural high school. I competed for a regional scholarship from Yale
                    University and got it. I should say that I graduated from high school a half
                    year early in order to be able to go with my parents to Denmark on State
                    Department travel orders. I was in Denmark from January, 1949, till the end of
                    August, 1949, when I went to New Haven, Connecticut, to start college at
                    Yale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you toward Yale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: My father had always said, “The sky's the limit.” He said that I should
                    think about going to some university other than the University of California at
                    Berkeley, which was my home. My father said, “Why don't you try Harvard?” When
                    we were living in Brazil in the mid 1940's, I had a piano teacher, a Brazilian,
                    who had taken his music degree at Yale. A friend of his, one of his teachers at
                    Yale, visited him. He came around and visited us and persuaded me that I should
                    apply to Yale, rather than to Harvard. So I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Denmark, this was still during the
                        post-war period, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was the early post-war period. We had ration stamps for everything.
                    You couldn't eat in a restaurant without handing over ration stamps. I went with
                    my father when he made a field trip to Norway because he was the Regional Labor
                    Officer for Scandinavia, or at least for Denmark and Norway. That was an
                    interesting trip.</p>
                <p>What impressed me as much as anything in Norway was the ice cream on a stick,
                    except that the ice cream was made from whale oil. My God, was that awful!
                    [Laughter] Even the Danes had decent margarine, as well as some butter. Norway
                    was still suffering deeply from the results of World War II.</p>
                <p>However, even in Denmark we had to be resupplied via the US military supply
                    service. We could get meat once a month. We had a kind of half refrigerator,
                    which wouldn't hold a month's supply of meat. We rigged a platform outside the
                    window of our apartment on the shady side of the building and put the meat on
                    it. We prayed that the meat would keep for a month that far north of the
                    equator. However, we learned that in the second half of the month, it was a
                    prudent idea to use it only in highly spiced stews!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were essentially living off the fat of the land,
                        compared to the Danes at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ROWELL: We were living without any real concern. The Danes weren't living badly,
                    but they worried a little more about it than we did. For example, I went to stay
                    with a Danish family on their farm in Jutland. At the farm we had eggs, ham and
                    cereals. We had very decent meals. All of the Danes in Jutland were having
                    decent meals. It wasn't because this was a wealthy family. It was just that when
                    you were living in a farming area, you ate all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had you caught the Foreign Service “bug” from
                        watching your father, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: A little bit. I took a degree in international relations at Yale,
                    graduating in 1953. As all university seniors do, I began to be concerned over
                    what would happen “when I left the womb.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Yale. In the international
                        relations field were your courses pitched in any particular way? Was there a
                        Yale international outlook or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I took international relations because I couldn't decide in what field to
                    major. I couldn't choose between economics, sociology, political science, and
                    history. However, I could take international relations, which was in the
                    Political Science Department, and spread myself over all of those four
                    disciplines. That's how I wound up in international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that I graduated from Williams College in 1950.
                        I had been a history major. However, with the development of the United
                        Nations, I was wondering whether that had any particular interest for you at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, I don't think so. In fact, if there was any sort of a push at all
                    that I can recall in the Political Science Department, it was to try to be more
                    scientific, if I can put it that way. For example, the best grade I ever got was
                    on a paper based on the following approach: “The British have just divested
                    themselves of their colonies. The British have a Socialist government. One could
                    argue that the ideological underpinnings of this government were directly
                    related to the divestiture of their colonies. But let's take a look at what
                    really happened.” In the end, I concluded that the British HAD to let go of
                    their colonies. They didn't have any choice. Every time they came to a decision
                    point, they behaved as British, rather than as Socialists — both when they
                    decided to let go of a given territory and when they decided to hang on.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>So I set up a hypothesis. I devised a test for the hypothesis. Then I went out
                    and collected the data to see what I would come up with. That was the thrust. It
                    didn't make any difference whether one was studying UN affairs, the League of
                    Nations, NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] (which was being formed at
                    the time), or the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Marshall Plan.
                    They were all good things. They weren't being challenged, particularly. However,
                    if you wanted to do a paper on them, it had to be an analytical study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Yale in 1953. The Korean War was just
                        about over, I guess, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, although even though we signed a truce in Korea in the summer of
                    1953, we kept taking losses for at least three years after that. If you were
                    assigned anywhere near the DMZ, that is, the Demilitarized Zone, you were on
                    constant alert. There were continual probes and infiltrations — minor firefights
                    at the squad level, and that sort of thing. People were still being shot, so you
                    didn't want to go to Korea if you didn't have to. I was drafted. In true
                    military fashion, about 200 of us were inducted into the Army the day before
                    Thanksgiving, . Of the 200, I was one of four who did not go to Korea. So I was
                    lucky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I went to Germany. Again, there is no substitute for luck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Let me tell you about luck. When I was finishing the first half of my
                    infantry basic training at Ft. Ord, California, I and all the other recruits
                    were marched to the Personnel Center. One of the non-commissioned officers in
                    the Personnel Center was a person with whom I had shared rides back and forth to
                    Yale, between Berkeley, California, and New Haven, Connecticut, for three years.
                    He said, “I can only assign you to your second half of basic training but I'm
                    going to assign you to 'dumb-bell antiaircraft' at Ft. Bliss, Texas, because
                    nobody's going to use those antiaircraft weapons again. That means that you'll
                    have all kinds of options.”</p>
                <p>So I went off to Texas. In Texas they got around to asking whether any of us knew
                    a foreign language. Although I was probably strongest in Portuguese, I also
                    offered Russian, which I'd studied in college, and French, which I'd studied in
                    high school. I passed the Russian and French tests, but not the Portuguese. So
                    the Army said, “You're not good enough to be an interpreter, but you're probably
                    more use to us in a unit in Europe than you would be in Korea, especially given
                    your weak (myopic) eyes.” So I went to Europe.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: I was stationed in Stuttgart in the Ordnance Battalion that supported the
                    Seventh Army. This was the maintenance and supply and not the ammunition side of
                    things. We kept the vehicles going. Our geographic area of responsibility ran
                    from the Czech border with the Federal Republic of Germany to France. I became
                    the operations non-commissioned officer for the battalion. It was a very
                    interesting job, and I had a lot of fun. I was invited several times to go to
                    OCS [Officer Candidate School]. I said, “No, I want to be a Foreign Service
                    Officer. I'll do my military duty but when I'm done, I'm going to go into the
                    Foreign Service.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that from the time you were at Yale, you had
                        made your decision to enter the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, I interviewed with a number of private firms, but my interest was
                    all focused on overseas business. By that time I knew that I wanted to go
                    overseas. I was thinking in terms of being an expatriate employee of American
                    industry. They all wanted me to start out as a salesman. I said, “I did some
                    sales work when I was earning money in college. I did not enjoy it particularly
                    and wasn't sure that I wanted to be a salesman.” Of course, I had experienced
                    the “how-to-live-abroad” side of the Foreign Service. I hadn't quite understood
                    yet that we all had to be salesmen for the US</p>
                <p>I took the Foreign Service written exam in 1953, shortly before I was drafted
                    into the Army. I passed it and then I was drafted. The State Department told me
                    that all I had to do to remain eligible to enter the Foreign Service was to
                    re-take the foreign language exam, which I promptly failed again. However, that
                    was enough to keep my candidacy alive.</p>
                <p>After two years in the Army I was discharged around Thanksgiving of 1955. At the
                    time my parents were assigned to the State Department in Washington. I went to
                    be with them and then went to the State Department and told them, “All right,
                    I'm out of the Army. How do I take the oral exam?” They said, “Well, you can
                    take it on December 12 1955.” So I took the oral exam and passed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Foreign Service oral examination like at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was a two-hour exam given by a panel of three people. I had had some
                    preparation for the oral exam. When I graduated from Yale, I had a fellowship as
                    a graduate teaching assistant at Berkeley, California. I thought that I would
                    work for an advanced degree in Political Science. I knew that I was going to
                    take the Foreign Service exam, because my interviews with private business
                    companies had left me feeling very uncertain and uneasy.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>The head librarian at the Berkeley campus of the University of California was
                    nationally known as a mother hen to FSO candidates. I had been told that when I
                    left Yale. I knew that I was going to be attending Berkeley. I walked into her
                    office in June, 1953, and said, “I'm going to take the Foreign Service written
                    exam in September. How will I prepare for it?” She gave me a list of readings
                    and said, “Sit down and read these things. I'll give you a study carrel in the
                    library. If you do your homework, you shouldn't have any problem.” And I didn't.
                    That was for the written exam. The oral exam was sort of a follow on to that. So
                    I was psychologically ready to take that, even though I took it two years later.
                    I knew that, given my background, having lived in Brazil and having served
                    overseas in the Army, one of the things that the oral examination panel would
                    focus on was whether I understood the United States. They would be comfortable
                    with my ability to live overseas. So I prepared myself that way. All I did was
                    read periodicals — I read the previous six months of the Week in Review
                    supplement of The New York Times during the three week period I had to get
                    ready. I also read the weekly news magazines.</p>
                <p>I was the second person to be examined by the oral board that morning. In the
                    waiting room there was a copy of US News and World Report, so I read that.
                    During the oral exam the most taxing question they asked me was, “Suppose you're
                    a brand new Third Secretary in the Political Section of the Swedish Embassy
                    here. President Eisenhower has just come out of his ileitis operation. What
                    would you say? What would you report about what's going on in this country?” So
                    I gave them a report just as I had read it in US News and World Report. It
                    turned out to have been a good report. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service in April, 1956. Can
                        you describe the Foreign Service class that you came in with at that
                        time—their outlook and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There were 15 of us in the class, three of them women. What was our
                    outlook? We were all imbued with a sense of adventure, a desire to serve people
                    and our country, and a belief we were embarking on permanent careers. We all
                    looked upon the Foreign Service as a United States service. There were the
                    military services, the Public Health Service, the Civil Service, and the Foreign
                    Service. We had joined the Foreign Service. We all looked forward to going
                    abroad, savoring adventure, and helping America. We were all ambitious. We
                    didn't kid ourselves. We figured that, statistically, not more than two or three
                    of us, at the most, might ever have a chance to be a chief of mission. At the
                    same time each and every one of us was confident that we could be one of those
                    two or three people. We wanted to give it a fling.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I guess that one or two of us in the class were trying the Foreign Service on for
                    size. They weren't at all sure that they were going to stay. But I would say
                    that at least 80 percent of us thought that we had found a lifetime career. So
                    there we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well do you feel that the course at the Foreign
                        Service Institute—FSI prepared you for the State Department? What
                        impressions were you getting of the State Department during this training
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The most important thing that I got out of the A-100 course at the FSI
                    was that we had just joined the Foreign Service of the United States of America.
                    We had not joined the Foreign Service of the Department of State or of USIA
                    [United States Information Agency] or of any other agency. Nor even,
                    necessarily, the Foreign Service of the executive branch of the United States
                    Government. We were members of THE Foreign Service. Our job was to serve abroad,
                    to serve all Americans and all American agencies and institutions with the best
                    we could give — all of them equally.</p>
                <p>Did this basic training prepare me to deal with the Department of State? Probably
                    not. That wasn't part of the agenda, really. The agenda focused on things like
                    consular law and consular procedures. There was a little bit about the structure
                    of an Embassy. I didn't need that. Simply by observing my father's experiences
                    when I was a teenager, I'd learned enough to have some sense of how Embassies
                    were structured, who was in charge, what the Sections were, and what kinds of
                    work they did. For example, when we lived in Brazil, my mother had had to return
                    to the US to take care of my ailing grandfather. She had taken my younger
                    brother with her, so there were just my father and myself at home. He had field
                    trips to take. It was summer vacation time, and he took me to the interior of
                    Brazil, visiting Brazil's first steel mill, visiting labor housing, driving
                    through the country, surviving on feijoada (fay-zho-ah'-dah), a bean dish that's
                    always steaming hot and, therefore, always safe to eat, no matter where you are
                    in Brazil. We were traveling with the British labor attach�, and he and my
                    father would discuss their observations and their import during the long dusty
                    hours of back-road driving. So I had some sense of what foreign service and
                    embassies were all about.</p>
                <p>I don't remember too much else about the A-100 course, except for one instructor.
                    She had just come from a consular assignment at Kobe, Japan. At the end of a
                    rather dry hour on regulations governing shipping and seamen, she said, “And,
                    when handling seamen, never let more than one at a time into your office and
                    always have a baseball bat under the desk.” [Laughter] She was colorful. I
                    remember a lecture by U. Alexis Johnson [former Ambassador to Japan and later
                    Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs], who said, “This is a
                    disciplined Service. You've signed on to go where you're sent. We are a
                    Service.” Then I discovered, not too much later, that he had gotten where he had
                    gone because he asked for specific jobs and manipulated the system to do it. So
                    I said to myself, “All right, there is Service discipline, but this also is a
                    Service which has certain 'buttons' to push.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up on any of the rankings in the Foreign
                        Service — the different types of work and where you should go, or had you
                        pretty well determined what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, although it became clearer to me during the A-100 course than it had
                    been previously that where one should or would go all depended on circumstances.
                    But we had little-to-no influence over our first assignments. Still, the
                    Political Officers were riding First Class, the Economic Officers were riding
                    Business Class, and everybody else was in Economy Class. That was clear to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I suppose that they still had the “April Fool”
                        sheet, as we used to call it, or assignment preference report.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You filled it out on April 1, hence the name, April Fool
                        report. What were you asking for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: First of all, I asked to be assigned to Washington. I wasn't married but
                    I wanted to be married. Even if I hadn't had that personal motivation on the
                    family side, I knew that it was important to understand the Department of State
                    in Washington. I figured that I wasn't going to learn the Department of State at
                    the FSI. I was going to learn it by having a Washington assignment. So I asked
                    for a Washington assignment, just to become known in the Department and to
                    understand it and how it worked.</p>
                <p>If that hadn't been enough, then there was another quaint vestige of other eras.
                    Two other members of my class and I were summoned by the Class Chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Jan Nadelman at the time, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ROWELL: That name sounds familiar. It may have been Jan, but I think it was Max
                    Krebs. In any case we were called into one of the Personnel Offices. At the time
                    they were in a low, one-story, temporary building on 23rd Street where “New
                    State” now stands. The Class Chairman said that he had called us in because all
                    three of us would be assigned to Washington on a first tour. All three of us
                    were bachelors. The Department thought that it would be a rather good idea to
                    give us two years in Washington so that, maybe, we could be married before we
                    went overseas. [Laughter] That was to avoid potentially awkward liaisons with
                    non-Americans once we were overseas. All three of us took this very seriously.
                    It turned out that one of us stuck a finger in the Department's eye, anyhow, by
                    marrying a secretary from the Swedish Embassy. However, I was married before I
                    left Washington. Shortly before he went overseas on his first assignment abroad,
                    the other one of the three of us bit the bullet and married his secretary in the
                    Department. But we all went out properly encumbered, and the three of us are
                    still married to the same ladies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does capture the spirit of an era. I went through the
                        same thing. I went through the A-100 course just a year earlier, in July,
                        1955. At that time did you pick up any reverberations of security problems
                        within the State Department? Senator Joseph McCarthy died about that
                        time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: But he was finished. The McCarthy era was over. We had had a terrible
                    experience with the treatment of John Stewart Service several years before. Yes,
                    nerves were still jangling, but there was a general recognition that it was
                    something that had gone much too far. The Foreign Service had gone through a
                    period of witch hunting, and it was a horrible experience. There was a feeling
                    that our political system could allow this to happen again, and you might never
                    know when. But what you learned was to be very careful. That didn't mean being
                    careful about your political judgments so much as careful about how much you
                    revealed about yourself, your associations, and your friendships.</p>
                <p>I could say something else about the McCarthy era. When I was at Yale, one day I
                    bumped into a man who had lived around the corner from us when I was about nine
                    years old in Washington. His name was Jack Marsalka. He and his wife were of
                    Czech origin. He said, “Gee, what are you doing here?” How he recognized me, I
                    don't know. Maybe I still looked enough the way that I had looked as a child. He
                    was living in New Haven, Connecticut. He invited me out to his house. I wrote to
                    my father about this. At the time my father was either the number two or number
                    three officer at our Legation in Budapest — I don't remember which. I think that
                    he was the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission]. He wrote me right back and said,
                    “Look, Jack was associated with a number of 'communist front' organizations
                    during the depression and during World War II. Things are very 'tight' in
                    Washington. If you are even remotely thinking of ever joining the Foreign
                    Service, don't have anything to do with Jack.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That happened to me when I was in college. So I had had a certain lesson
                    in college. By the time I got to Washington I didn't really need another
                    lesson.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In the A-100 course everyone was on tenterhooks. One of our lecturers was
                    from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration. (At that time it
                    was called the Assistant Secretary/Controller.) Our lecturer was running
                    something called the “Manpower Utilization Staff.” It tried to measure how to
                    get the best out of the human resources at hand. He said that he was looking for
                    a junior officer to be a go-fer — a staff assistant. He asked whether anybody in
                    our class was interested. I went up to him at the end of the hour and said that
                    I was interested. I followed up, and he said that he would talk to somebody in
                    Personnel. Well, I thought that he would never really talk to somebody in
                    Personnel, but he did. Anyhow, connections weren't made, and the next thing I
                    knew, they were reading out our next assignments. Half of us, including me, were
                    slated for the old biographic files—in other words, total boredom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How awful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: So I raised my hand and said, “Well, I've already volunteered for another
                    job and the man said that I could have it.” I said, “I don't know how my name is
                    on this list but I don't think that it's supposed to be there.” They told me,
                    “You're not supposed to go out getting yourselves jobs.” I said, “Well, he
                    invited us to volunteer if we were interested, it was in the open class, and I
                    responded.” They rolled their eyes and said, “Well, we suppose that a new
                    recruit doesn't know that he's not supposed to respond to open invitations to
                    apply for a job.” I wound up working for the Manpower Utilization Staff.</p>
                <p>That job lasted about a year. In effect, we did input/output, efficiency
                    inspections of various offices in the Department, which was what I had looked
                    forward to. This gave me a chance to see how things worked, who talked with
                    whom, and who didn't talk with whom. Generally, how things were connected or
                    weren't connected. That office closed after about a year, and I wound up in the
                    budget office. I knew absolutely nothing about budgets but I learned a little
                    bit about the budgeting process. This gave me lots of extra time. I learned
                    Portuguese on my own and managed to pass the oral exam with a grade of 3-3
                    [speaking ability 3—useful; reading ability 3—useful], before going to my first
                    overseas assignment and without taking any Portuguese course at the FSI. That
                    was the minimum level one had to have in order to qualify for a first
                    promotion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you worked on the Manpower Utilization Staff, what
                        struck you about it? Were you struck by anything that remained in your
                        memory bank thereafter, about how things operated or didn't operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Not really. It was a big bureaucracy. I learned some valuable things. I
                    learned to think in terms of defining missions and objectives. I attempted to
                    define them concretely enough so that the results could be measurable. I learned
                    to think in terms of output, rather than input, and of measurable outputs,
                    rather than activities. For example, representation as such is an activity. The
                    output is a relationship with a person whose knowledge or authority we value and
                    who will respond to that relationship. But it is the relationship that counts.
                    The dinner doesn't count. It's whether that person is then accessible in a way
                    in which that person wasn't accessible before, and whether this is a person to
                    whom it is worth having access, that is, positioned and willing to do things we
                    want. That counts. You judge whether that person is worth having access to in
                    terms of what American interests require us to get done. It was that kind of
                    thought process.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: No. I tried to be assigned to Mozambique. I tried desperately to go to
                    Mozambique. Since the language I had passed was Portuguese, I figured that I
                    would be assigned to a Portuguese speaking post. I knew that Mozambique was
                    exotic. I had lived in Brazil and thought that I knew something about that
                    country. However, I wanted to have a totally different experience. I had joined
                    the Foreign Service for adventure. However, the Personnel people said that I was
                    assigned to Brazil. So I went to Brazil.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: I was a Vice Consul and general factotum. I would add one thing. I had
                    married in August, 1957, and had asked for a hardship post. I figured that my
                    wife would find that her adjustment to her first Foreign Service assignment was
                    miserable, no matter where she went. That was knowledge that I had gleaned as a
                    teenager, when I had gone with my father to our first foreign post in Brazil. I
                    just knew that my wife's initial adjustment was going to be hard. I could be
                    assigned to Paris, and she would be miserable. I thought that if she would go
                    through her initial misery at a hardship post, the next assignment would be to a
                    nicer place than the first post and she would know how to enjoy all the
                    advantages of the new post.</p>
                <p>It took me a year and a half to persuade her to marry me. She said that I was all
                    right, but she wasn't too sure about the Foreign Service. She was a legal
                    secretary and was making about 20% more money than I was as a junior officer. So
                    we were going to give up that income. She had been born and raised in
                    Washington. All of her friends lived here, and she liked the city. She had all
                    kinds of contacts in social and business terms. Everything was going for her.
                    She liked her job, her work was challenging, and I was going to take her
                    away.</p>
                <p>So I had done a lot of persuading, but I had done it in the usual, Foreign
                    Service style. I attempted to undersell the Foreign Service. I told her that
                    there were going to be miserable times and that learning a foreign language was
                    hard. She had never learned a foreign language. I told her that there would be
                    feelings of isolation, that there would be no conveniences, there would be no
                    frozen orange juice, and all of that. Boy, was I right!</p>
                <p>I knew that it was going to be hard. I didn't realize how hard until we were in
                    Recife. For example, there were only 14,000 telephone instruments and 6,000
                    phone lines in a city of a million people. (Of the million, only 500,000 were in
                    the money economy.) Private residences didn't have telephones, although I think
                    that the Consul had a telephone in his house. That was it. The rest of the
                    entire American community, except for the manager of the phone company, had no
                    private telephones. So the thing was to find a house somewhere near another
                    American — ideally, within walking distance, because we only had one car.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I want to give you some feel for our life there. We found a small two-bedroom
                    house in a good neighborhood near the ocean. The ocean was important because
                    there was no air conditioning and we depended on trade winds to keep the heat
                    and humidity bearable. The house was made of cement and cinder block. When it
                    rained you could get a small electric shock if you touched a wall because the
                    wires were inadequately sheathed and the moisture penetrated everything. The
                    water supply failed daily. I had to spend a week's salary to buy a pump and
                    small tank which I set up in the backyard so I could pump water through a hose
                    to the tank on the roof. I had to refill the roof tank at least once every three
                    days. During spring tides our street and yard would flood and crabs would run
                    through the flower bed. My wife often had to wash her hair in the back yard
                    because the water pressure was too low to put water in the house. We kept
                    water-filled buckets in the bathrooms to flush the toilets. Cows walking by our
                    fence would eat the flowers, and donkeys would get in the yard and leave their
                    droppings on the front porch. That happened once just before people arrived for
                    a dinner we were giving. Across the street was a tidal swamp where people lived
                    in mud and wattle huts. When we would set out garbage, they raided the garbage
                    can. My wife's cookbooks didn't work because there weren't any prepared foods in
                    the market — no frozen foods, no baby foods, no mayonnaise, no standard
                    qualities of goods. How do you judge the working power of brown yeast that you
                    cut from a barrel-sized cake? We and the other Americans in the community built
                    a combination church/elementary school. It was made of poles and a thatched
                    roof, no walls. We had lots of barbecues and the beer was good.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>My wife has recorded her own oral history, so I won't recount her experiences
                    here, except for one. That one illustrates how awfully tough an adjustment a
                    first overseas living experience can be. The day we disembarked in Recife from a
                    twelve-passenger freighter (we were several years before jet travel and
                    universal air connections to everywhere), we moved into my predecessor's house.
                    His family had already returned to the US some weeks before. He put us in his
                    house partly because there were other American families within walking distance
                    and he knew my wife couldn't yet speak Portuguese. After lunch he and I went to
                    the consulate, a twenty-minute drive from the neighborhood. Incidentally, there
                    were no paved streets in the neighborhood. None of the neighbors yet knew my
                    wife was in the house. A maid who spoke no English was there. (Everyone had to
                    have a maid to boil and filter drinking water, pick the stones and dirt out of
                    the food bought at the market, and protect the house from thieves.) Lonely, my
                    wife decided to take a nap. Suddenly an awful screeching and shouting outside
                    woke her up. She looked through the shutters and saw what appeared to be Indians
                    waving tomahawks and long knives and beating drums. She was scared to death, had
                    no idea what they wanted or were saying, couldn't find or understand the maid
                    and, of course, couldn't telephone because there wasn't any telephone. She
                    locked herself in her room and cried. When my predecessor and I arrived home she
                    told us and we started to laugh. We knew the crowd at the gate was a dance
                    company collecting donations for costumes so it could compete in Carnaval
                    Brazilian Mardi Gras contests. But I immediately felt guilty for smiling. I
                    still do. She had no way of knowing what was going on. She didn't panic. She did
                    the best she could. And she didn't give up on me, the Foreign Service or
                    herself. She learned Portuguese, became a community leader, founded a YWCA
                    [Young Women's Christian Association] chapter, extended our circle of friends
                    with Brazilians whom I never would have known otherwise. It was tough. She did
                    it with her own grit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's first talk about the post in Recife, and then we'll
                        talk about the political and economic situation in Recife, as you saw it.
                        First, what was the post like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We had a Branch Public Affairs Officer named Rod Horton. We had one
                    officer from another agency who had the title of Vice Consul. He had an
                    assistant. We had one State Department Vice Consul — me. We had a Consul, who
                    was also a State Department officer. He had been integrated into the State
                    Department from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and had previously
                    served at the Consulate General in Naples, Italy.</p>
                <p>There was a US Air Force detachment at Recife. It was called a “Weather
                    Detachment.” In fact, their function was to monitor a whole range of things that
                    were important. I won't go further than that, but that is what they did. They
                    were not concerned with things related to Brazil, but rather with the Cold War
                    stand off.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Based in Recife were also four ships run by Pan American Airways. They operated
                    under contract with the Department of Defense. Their job was to track missiles
                    that we were testing. The Atlantic Missile Range with which they were concerned
                    went down the Atlantic Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, and into the Indian
                    Ocean. Every time we got ready to test missiles, these four ships would go out
                    into positions along the Atlantic Missile Flyway. They would go out for about a
                    week or 10 days. Then they would come back in and wait — maybe for two or three
                    weeks. They would be waiting on the beach until the next fly. Then they would go
                    out again. There were technical crew members on the ships. They were listed as
                    passengers, but they were the guys who ran all of the monitoring equipment.</p>
                <p>Then there were the seamen on the ships. These were ordinary merchant marine
                    seamen. Those guys could get into more trouble! A merchant mariner is fine when
                    he's on a ship at sea, but when he's in port, with nothing to do, then he starts
                    to look for things to do. That's when the Vice Consul begins to enjoy life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular cases that come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Oh, yes. One of the things that would happen, over and over again, is
                    that a seaman would appear at my office in the Consulate with a woman by his
                    side. He would say, “Mr. Vice Consul, I would like to get a visa for this lady.”
                    I would reply, “What kind of visa are you looking for?” He would say, “Well, she
                    wants to go and live in the United States.” I would say, “She needs an immigrant
                    visa.” I would ask a couple of questions and then would say, “I'm sorry, but
                    this lady isn't eligible for an immigrant visa.” There were provisions in the
                    law that made prostitutes ineligible for immigrant visas. The seaman would turn
                    to the lady and say, “I'm sorry, honey, but I tried!” [Laughter] Then he would
                    walk out. He had done his thing.</p>
                <p>One of the ships would be going out of town, and a seaman would get involved in a
                    brawl. I had an arrangement with the Chief of Police that had really been set up
                    by my predecessor. These seamen would be arrested, but the police had a cell
                    that was a little bit cleaner, drier, and more pleasant than the others. The
                    seamen would be put in that cell. The police would give me a phone call so that
                    I would know that they had one of our seamen in jail. If the seaman was close to
                    the end of his tour on the ship, he'd stay in jail until the next Pan American
                    resupply flight. Those flights came in three times a week. The seaman would be
                    delivered by the police directly to planeside. There were no formal charges and
                    no problems. The wayward seamen were put on a plane and sent home to
                    Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
                <p>About once a year the ships had to change crews. I would go out to the ship.
                    Then, as the representative of the US Coast Guard, I would sign off the old crew
                    and sign on a new crew. A table would be set up in the officers' wardroom on
                    these ships. The captain, the purser, and I would be there. Technically, under
                    the law, I was the guy paying off the seamen. We're talking about 19th century
                    sailing-ship laws.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: That's right. In the 19th century you knew that they were illiterate. You
                    knew that shipping companies and captains took advantage of them and so on.
                    These were the laws which we were still operating under.</p>
                <p>So I would go out to the ship, climb up the Jacob's ladder, and go on board. I
                    had the consular seals in a little bag. Usually, I would hire a man as an
                    oarsman with some kind of dinghy. I would be rowed around the harbor. It wasn't
                    a powerboat operation. I would climb up. The Captain would greet me. We would go
                    into the wardroom. The Ship's Articles would be there. About one in five seamen
                    signing off the ship would register a complaint. The amount of money to be paid
                    was there. I would count out the amount of money. He would sign it under
                    protest. He would say, “They didn't treat me right,” or, “They docked my pay for
                    this, and it's not fair, not right.” I would say, “Fine, you can talk to the
                    seamen's union. They'll represent you. All you have to do is sign your name and
                    write the words, 'under protest' afterwards, and I'll pay you.” So that usually
                    did it. I would stamp the papers with the Consulate seal, a big impression seal,
                    and away we would go. Then the replacements would come aboard, and I would watch
                    them sign on, one by one. I would put the Consulate seal on the papers, and that
                    was it.</p>
                <p>The other thing is that, under the laws at that time, whenever a merchant ship of
                    US registry was in the harbor for more than 24 hours, it had to deposit the
                    ship's articles and charter with the local Consul. They had to bring these
                    papers in. The Pan American ships, of course, would be in port for three weeks
                    at a time. We had a big safe, just for holding ship's articles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the newly-minted Consul, the
                        former Immigration and Naturalization Service officer? They really came from
                        a separate selection process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You know, prestige required that I do the visas, because that was
                    something that the most senior officer wouldn't touch. But he really knew visas
                    and immigration law. Prestige said that he would take care of citizenship
                    matters, so he took care of American passports and so on. He was a wonderful
                    person, a real gentleman from the Old South. His wife was also from the Old
                    South — a lovely person, Eleanor Whitaker. I couldn't have asked for a finer
                    mentor in terms of consular operations.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I became the de facto economic and political reporting officer, because the
                    Consul felt out of his water in those fields. He had the contacts, he had the
                    conversations, and I was green. Boy, was I green! So I wasn't that good a
                    political or economic reporting officer. However, I did the economic and
                    business reporting. When it came to visas, if I ever had a question or if there
                    ever was any doubt, I'd go into his office, and he'd give me an answer, just
                    like that! It was always the right answer, so I learned a lot about consular
                    operations from him. It made a big difference to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe how Recife was in those days? In the
                        first place, I have trouble placing it. Is it on the bulge of Brazil facing
                        East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, it's right on Brazil's eastern-most point on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where we had a major air base for the air ferry
                        service during World War II, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. It was the takeoff point for aircraft being ferried to
                    Africa. They would take off from Recife or from Natal, which was about 80 or 100
                    miles farther north. The planes would try to land for refueling at one of the
                    South Atlantic islands — I think that it was Ascension Island — and then make
                    the jump to Africa. Typically in those flights they would have one experienced
                    navigator in the lead plane, and everybody had to stay in visual contact with
                    him. If they missed him, they were so green at navigation that they would get
                    lost, go down, and disappear in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
                <p>There was a hospital in Recife that we used. It was the Brazilian Air Force
                    hospital which had been built by the US Army Air Corps during the war. That's
                    where our first son was born. It had no windows. It had screening and wooden
                    shutters that you could put down over the screens when the rains came. It had a
                    thatched roof. They whitewashed it with DDT [insecticide] impregnated lime once
                    every three months. It had cement floors that were scrubbed with some kind of
                    antiseptic — Clorox or whatever it was — every day. It was far and away the
                    healthiest hospital in town. However, the doctors there were all either military
                    personnel or reserve military, and they would periodically become politically
                    active. Then they would be confined to quarters. The one obstetrician there was
                    more politically active than most of the doctors. When we got close to delivery
                    time, we weren't sure what we were going to have in the way of medical
                    attention. [Laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It made you an astute, political reporter at this

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Brazil at the time,
                        and how did it reflect itself in Recife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There were always rumors of possible coups. There was a populist
                    President, Juscelino Kubitschek, who actually survived to serve his full
                    four-year term. If there weren't rumblings about coups against the government,
                    then there were rumblings about coups against senior generals. So there was
                    always a certain amount of turmoil.</p>
                <p>More to the point, northeastern Brazil, the area called the “dry interior,” or
                    the “sert�o” in Portuguese, had always been an area where minor military
                    “captains” ran the place. The local military officer was a kind of king. The man
                    who was the elected governor of the state, Pernambuco, probably ran some kind of
                    political organization that had a whole bunch of thugs backing it up. In Macei�,
                    capital of the State of Alagoas which was in our consular district, the
                    authorities surrounded the State Legislature with sandbags to protect the
                    pedestrians on the sidewalk from the gunfire that often took place during debate
                    and voting. The sandbags were not to protect the Legislature. They were there to
                    protect the citizens passing by. You could see people going into that
                    Legislature with huge bulges underneath their clothes. Once some of them went in
                    wearing raincoats, on a perfectly sunny day, because they were carrying
                    automatic weapons under the raincoats. You weren't supposed to be showing those
                    in public.</p>
                <p>You did not challenge anyone who was an important personage, because they had
                    total impunity. For example, one day there was an altercation between a bus
                    driver and a kid belonging to an important family. The kid turned his car in
                    front of the bus, got out, and killed the bus driver. No charges were ever made
                    against him. The kid was identified, and there were lots of witnesses, but there
                    were no charges, because he was a member of a very good family. An American
                    teacher at the local missionary school was shot and killed by a student because
                    the teacher said that the student had failed. This involved something like 9th
                    grade algebra. No charges were ever brought. The student belonged to too
                    important a family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this mean in terms of visas? Did this ever
                        intrude in your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, because the kinds of persons who would not be eligible for a visa
                    didn't come from those “very good” families. If anybody from that kind of family
                    asked for a business or tourist visa, you gave it to them, because there was
                    every reason to think that they would return to their homes and none of them had
                    ever been convicted of a crime involving “moral turpitude” — another basis for
                    exclusion. In any case, none of the persons involved in any of the notorious
                    events I just mentioned ever came to me for a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're obviously talking about the height of the Cold War.
                        Was there any concern about communism and Soviet infiltration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, and the communists were quite strong in the sugar workers' union.
                    The old sugar plantations still had people who were, in effect, tied to the
                    land. They were latter day serfs. But they had unions, and the communists tried
                    to organize them. In fact, a fair number of communists were elected to the State
                    Legislature. They kept trying to push what we would call a “Leftist agenda.”
                    They really didn't represent a threat to Brazil, because that part of Brazil
                    simply didn't have that much weight in the capital at Rio de Janeiro. That area
                    had some nostalgic power.</p>
                <p>Brazil had always consisted of baronies. Remember, it was a monarchy until 1889.
                    These different states had been carved out by various Portuguese nobles. Their
                    descendants were still running these states in a kind of feudalistic style.</p>
                <p>There is another aspect of Recife—a professional aspect—which was important. We
                    had a number of AID [Agency for International Development] people there.
                    Periodically, I would travel with them. Occasionally, the Agricultural Attach�
                    would come up from Rio de Janeiro, and I would travel with him in the interior
                    of the country. He taught me a whole lot about agricultural economics. He taught
                    me how to do agricultural reporting. He introduced me to people whom I was later
                    able to consult to fill out my reporting. I got a lot of help from the
                    Agricultural Attach� in learning how to be a decent Economic Officer. I enjoyed
                    the AID officers and I appreciated them as dedicated people.</p>
                <p>I also went through my first bit of insanity in Recife. That was the night when
                    one of our Brazilian neighbors came to our house. She said that I had to help
                    her. Her adolescent son had gotten his father's .45 caliber pistol and was busy
                    trying to shoot at a US Air Force Sergeant who lived across the street from
                    them, right around the corner from our house. I went out in the middle of the
                    street and got between them. However, we were good friends of the Brazilian
                    family, as well as of the Sergeant and his family. The kid didn't want to shoot
                    me. So he stopped pointing the pistol at the Sergeant. I persuaded the boy that
                    his honor had been suitably defended and that the honorable and grownup thing to
                    do would be to return to his house and give the gun back to his father. His
                    father was at home but didn't know what to do.</p>
                <p>I also said that the Air Force Sergeant was going to leave the street first. Then
                    I turned around and told the Sergeant to go into his house. He didn't want to
                    leave the street. He saw it as “retreating under fire.” I directed him as his
                    superior officer. He saluted, because he had been given an order. He could
                    return to his house with some dignity. It was only some time later that I broke
                    out into a cold sweat when I realized the risks I had been taking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the hand of Ellis Briggs at all? He was our

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ROWELL: He came up to Recife and visited a couple of times. He went through the
                    pro forma process of asking, “How are things in the Northeast” when we met at an
                    introductory party. He was asking my opinion, and I made the mistake of starting
                    to give it. I saw his eyes instantly glaze and realized that he was just kind of
                    going through the motions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the feeling that Recife was “far from the
                        Czar...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: “Far from the Czar.” There were really no particular problems there. I
                    learned a couple of other things. I learned that Washington is mesmerized by the
                    press and pays a lot more attention to the press than it does to what Foreign
                    Service posts are saying. There had been some rumblings about a military coup
                    that was taking place in Recife. Somehow a Time magazine stringer had written an
                    exotic report which had been published in Washington. I'd written a report on
                    the event but I hadn't gotten it off right away, because what really happened
                    was that a tank had parked in front of the State Legislature for demonstration
                    purposes. It didn't mean a whole lot. It was all part of a personality clash
                    between the State Governor, the head of the State Legislature, and the State
                    Militia. A holiday had been declared, and the entire city had gone to the beach,
                    where people were playing soccer and having a very good time. So this was not
                    exactly a big deal. It couldn't shake the national government in Rio de
                    Janeiro.</p>
                <p>So nothing was going to change. I wrote a report, but you have to remember that
                    when we sent a telegram, it went by Western Union. If we encoded it, we used a
                    One-Time Pad [cipher system]. Nobody in his right mind in the Consulate wrote a
                    classified telegram if it could possibly be avoided.</p>
                <p>We received a zinger from the State Department in Washington, asking what was
                    happening. The whole country was supposedly in collapse because the Consulate in
                    Recife hadn't been reporting on this coup. I sent back a reply and said that
                    there wasn't any coup. Time magazine appeared on our newsstand about that time,
                    and I finally realized that Time had front-paged this thing. This was loony, and
                    I told the Department that. However, I learned from that experience that one had
                    to anticipate what was going to appear in Time magazine.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I learned another, far more telling lesson there. I went to the beach one day on
                    business, talked to some fishermen, and asked how they were living. I asked how
                    many days a week they fished. They fished three days a week. I asked, “Why don't
                    you fish four or five days? You'd make more money. Could you sell your fish?”
                    They replied, “Oh, yes.” I asked, “Could you sell them at as good or the same
                    price?” They said, “Yes.” So I said, “Well, you could almost double your income.
                    Why don't you do it?” They said, “Look, you see those grass shacks over there?
                    That's where we live. We have electricity. We have one water outlet in the
                    entire area but we don't have running water. We have outhouses outdoor toilets.
                    No sewage. We don't own the land. We're squatters. The money we make by fishing
                    in three days is enough to live there and to enjoy the life that we have. To buy
                    our own land — because we're not going to build a solid house if we don't own
                    the land — would take far more than twice our income. It would take up to 10
                    times the income we have. We don't know how to make that much. Given those
                    circumstances, we can pay cash to buy what we need with three days' work. The
                    other three days' work wouldn't give us any improvement in our quality of
                    life.”</p>
                <p>This was an illiterate fisherman who went out to fish on a balsa raft. This was
                    risky, because the main Atlantic steamship lane went through there. Every once
                    in a while at night a steamship would run through a raft, because the rafters
                    fished at night. This guy was an economically rational and smart. He might not
                    have been able to read and write, but he sure knew how to think and how to do
                    the numbers. I have since never forgotten that ordinary people can be very smart
                    and they are almost universally economically rational. If they're not behaving
                    the way our models predict, it's because our models are screwed up, not because
                    those people don't know what they're doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved to another Consulate didn't you? You were at the
                        Consulate in Recife until 1959. Were there any other incidents that happened
                        in Recife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, I would say that I've given you all of the formative incidents that
                    happened there. The only other thing was that Clare Boothe Luce was scheduled to
                    become Ambassador to Brazil. She had a monumental conflict with Senator Wayne
                    Morse [Republican, Oregon] who was on the Foreign Relations Committee, the
                    committee that has to consent to all ambassadorial appointments. I was scheduled
                    to become her staff aide. She was confirmed by the Senate and then resigned, as
                    if to say, “All right, I beat you, Wayne Morse.” And I was left without a job,
                    because there was no new Ambassador coming.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>We had already packed our belongings and moved out of our house in order to go to
                    the Embassy in Rio de Janeiro. Then we received a cable saying, “Sorry, transfer
                    canceled.” I had to go back to the landlord to ask if we could move back into
                    the house. We had to go to the packing company and ask them if they could
                    deliver our household effects, and we set up our household again. We had said
                    all of the farewells and had gone through all of that. So we took a two-week
                    vacation at the only vacation place in the area, a tuberculosis sanitarium in
                    Garanhuns, a town around 3,000 feet high and about 100 miles west southwest of
                    Recife. The principal food at the sanitarium consisted of boiled plantains a
                    type of banana that had to be cooked. But at least it meant a break from the
                    tropical humidity. Then, four months later, we were transferred to Curitiba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Curitiba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In southern Brazil in the State of Paran�. I went there as Principal
                    Officer (the officer in charge of a Foreign Service post).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1959 to 1962?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Until November, 1961. It was a totally different climate, in the
                    temperate zone. It's in the coffee zone, close to Sao Paulo. Curitiba presented
                    a whole new set of experiences. I finally finished polishing up my Portuguese by
                    osmosis. I was at the point where I felt comfortable giving a 20-minute,
                    impromptu speech any day of the week. I could talk with anybody.</p>
                <p>Southern Brazil was going through a kind of “gold rush.” The gold was coffee.
                    Ordinary people would go out to the jungle at the west end of the State of
                    Parana and get a contract to clear the jungle. Typically, the land would be
                    owned by a doctor or dentist in Sao Paulo or Curitiba, who had bought it from
                    the government. He would hire an illiterate person who would go out, clear the
                    land, and support himself and his family by engaging in subsistence farming. He
                    grew the subsistence crops between the rows of coffee bushes which he planted.
                    It takes four years before the first crop of coffee beans can be harvested.
                    That's a half crop. Then, in the fifth year, the bushes produce a full crop. The
                    man working the land had to work until the first, full crop was harvested. He
                    received all of the cash from the first, two crops—the half crop and the full
                    crop. He supported himself with subsistence farming. With the cash from the
                    first two crops he had enough money to buy his own coffee lands. He buys the
                    land and goes through the same process again, except that this time everything
                    was his. For people born with nothing, people who had no education, it was an
                    incredible opportunity to become, as they saw it, “rich land owners.” These
                    people were riding on top of trucks heading out to the western part of the
                    state. They were going out there by the thousands, with their wives and
                    sometimes infants.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>These were the class of people who, in northeastern Brazil, were serfs on sugar
                    plantations. The same communist leader who had won a substantial number of seats
                    for his party in Recife came to the State of Paran�. I tracked him as he went
                    around the state. I remember going out to a red dirt town in the western part of
                    the state. There was a big sign. There were 40 people who went out to listen to
                    him. Ten minutes later, there was one dog there, scratching his fleas, and the
                    American Consul from Curitiba. That was it. These people didn't have time for
                    that kind of nonsense. They were all going to get rich.</p>
                <p>There was high risk. They could get caught by bad weather, a freeze that would
                    destroy the coffee bushes. On average, Paran� has at least one such freeze every
                    ten years. Bad odds since it took ten years to get through two land-clearing,
                    coffee-planting cycles — the first for the original doctor or dentist landowner;
                    the second for the worker. However, enough workers — just enough of them — could
                    make it. It was like the gold rush in California. Not many people got rich, but
                    a lot of people managed to survive. Just enough of them got rich that you
                    couldn't stop the gold fever. It was exactly the same phenomenon. There is
                    nothing in this world like living through a gold rush. It's exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused this at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: A big boom in coffee prices. Brazil was expanding its output. In those
                    days, if you grew coffee, you could sell the coffee at a profitable price. It
                    was guaranteed by the Brazilian Coffee Institute. Coffee was as certain a cash
                    crop then as “coca” for cocaine is today in the Andes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I was the Principal Officer, the officer in charge, at the Consulate in
                    Curitiba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean? How big was the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: When I went there, the staff consisted of myself and one American Foreign
                    Service Staff person, whom I was able to have commissioned as a Vice Consul,
                    plus three Foreign Service Nationals [Brazilian employees]. The focus was on
                    consular work. The Mormon Church set up one of its two Brazilian headquarters
                    there, and we had about 130 Mormon missionaries operating out of Curitiba. We
                    spent a huge amount of time, registering them and making sure that they didn't
                    get into trouble. If they got into trouble, we helped them out with the
                    authorities.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I also reported on political and economic events — the economic growth of the
                    territory. I cut my teeth on my first important political report which I called,
                    “A Political Primer on Paran�.” I described the whole political structure and
                    dynamics of the state. We were in the run-up to a major national election.
                    President Kubitschek was finishing his term, and the constitution didn't allow
                    him to succeed himself. J�nio Quadros won the election.</p>
                <p>As President, Quadros traveled around the country. He was trying to bring the
                    presidency to people all over the country so they would feel less alienated from
                    the central government. It was a tactic he had used previously when he was
                    governor of S�o Paulo state. When he came to my consular district, I went out to
                    see how he was doing. During his first three or four months in office he
                    remained very popular. I could see that when I went to Florian�polis, State of
                    Santa Catarina, during one of his visits in early 1961. But four months later
                    when he came to Vila Velha, a town near Curitiba, he was doing miserably. He was
                    greeted by a couple of mayors, a military band, elements of the consular corps
                    and the state government, and maybe forty farm workers who had been rounded up
                    and brought to the dirt airport in army trucks. The band played and there were a
                    couple of speeches. But the onlookers never applauded — the only time in all my
                    years in Brazil that ordinary citizens refused to applaud the President. Quadros
                    didn't seem to notice. He was almost glassy-eyed, out of touch. He was perceived
                    to have lost control of the government. While economic problems were mounting,
                    he was traveling around like medieval royalty instead steering the country
                    toward solutions for its problems. He had lost all of his support in the rural
                    areas and even among the small- town conservatives who had been the original
                    backbone of his candidacy.</p>
                <p>Quadros didn't see this. Neither did the press and broadcast media in Rio de
                    Janeiro, which the US Embassy was monitoring, report it. They were putting a
                    rosy gloss on his travels. But I saw the political disaster and reported it to
                    the Embassy in Rio de Janeiro and to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The most dramatic event during my two and a half years in Curitiba started one
                    Wednesday evening in September (I believe it was September) 1961. I came home
                    from the Consulate. My wife said to me, “You know, something is up. I was at tea
                    today with the general's wife. After the tea Mrs. So-and-so took me aside and
                    said, 'Le, I'm not supposed to say anything, and you're not supposed to know,
                    but you are a young mother and you have a baby to take care of. Lay in some
                    extra supplies. This weekend you may not be able to leave your house. Just make
                    sure that you can take care of your family for about a week.'” For weeks there
                    had been rumors that Brazilian conservatives and the military were plotting to
                    oust Quadros. When my wife told me of the advice she had received from a
                    general's wife, I knew immediately that the military had decided to act. I
                    immediately got a report off to the Embassy and to the Department of State in
                    Washington. On the Friday night of that week there was a coup d'�tat. The part
                    of Brazil where I was located — the southernmost three states — opposed the coup
                    makers in the rest of the country. The coup took place at that time because the
                    Vice President, who was a Leftist and was believed to have too many friends who
                    were communists, was out of the country, on a trip to mainland China. The Army
                    thought that they could arrange things so that he wouldn't return to take
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Jo�o Goulart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He played quite a prominent role...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He did. So there was a standoff, because the southern three states, in
                    fact, the southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, was Goulart's primary,
                    political base. The southern three states were all part of the same military
                    zone. The other two states in the zone were Santa Catarina and Paran�. The
                    people in those states opposed the coup. I in Curitiba and our Consul in Porto
                    Alegre [Rio Grande do Sul] were the only two American consuls in the part of
                    Brazil that opposed the coup.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>As it happened, my wife was almost seven months pregnant. I was already a year
                    overdue for transfer. It was getting close to the point where she would have to
                    fly to the US or have our second baby in Brazil, as the airlines wouldn't let
                    her fly once she entered her eighth month of pregnancy. Because we were
                    scheduled to transfer from Brazil very shortly, we decided to try to get her
                    home to the US. I had to drive her from Curitiba to Sao Paulo, which was on the
                    other side of the lines the south from the coup makers in the rest of Brazil. I
                    had to get a laissez passer from the Army Command in the south and a similar
                    laissez passer from the military authorities in the north. I drove over the road
                    to Sao Paulo which, they warned, might be mined. There was a dirt road between
                    the two areas. It was all right going north. I took my wife and our eldest child
                    through the lines, was interrogated when I got to the other side, and went to
                    the Consulate General in Sao Paulo and reported in. She then flew out to Rio,
                    where they put her on the plane to the US. They had to get a court order in Rio
                    to allow her to take our eldest son because, under Brazilian law at the time, if
                    you didn't have a written permit from the father, no male child could be taken
                    out of the country.</p>
                <p>She received precious little help from the Embassy. A Foreign Service National
                    employee of the Embassy helped to move her from the hotel to the airport. She
                    was seven months pregnant, she had a two and one-half year old child running
                    around, she had the suitcases, and she had this document [the court order] which
                    she was told not to lose. She was told that it would be better to lose her
                    passport than the court order, because if she lost this, she couldn't take our
                    son with her. There was nobody to help her move her bags around the airport.
                    Nothing. She had to take care of herself. That was an experience that made us
                    think for a long time and about a lot of things. Not about quitting the Foreign
                    Service, but how you manage your life in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I drove back then to Curitiba and we waited things out. Eventually, Jo�o
                    Goulart came back to the country and was inaugurated President. My replacement
                    arrived, and I went back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular feel about the Embassy as the
                        Principal Officer at the Consulate in Curitiba, or did you still have the
                        feeling of being far away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Embassy seemed a little less remote from Curitiba than it had from
                    Recife. I had a lot more contact with the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission]. At the
                    time the Consul General in the Embassy was the Supervisory Consul General. He
                    oversaw all of the Consulates around the country. We had seven or eight
                    Consulates in Brazil at that time. We had an annual Principal Officers'
                    Conference. So we were quite a group when we got together. The Embassy was sure
                    that it was supervising all of us, except maybe the Consulate General in Sao
                    Paulo, where the Consul General typically had as high a rank in terms of pay
                    grade as the DCM in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We — all the principal officers — took seriously the authority that gave us the
                    right to communicate directly with the State Department in Washington. If you
                    used good sense, that never caused any heartburn at the Embassy. If you didn't
                    use good sense, they found a way to chastise you. However, for the most part,
                    this arrangement worked well, and the Embassy was helpful. We were a small
                    Consulate. We didn't have the time to go through all the folderol of endless,
                    administrative reports. The Embassy took care of that. They let us do our work
                    and picked up a lot of the administrative burden.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There was a lot of interest in Cuba, US-Cuban relations, and the problems

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just at the beginning of the Castro regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: This was at the time of the Bay of Pigs disaster in January, 1961. People
                    paid a lot of attention to that, but we were still basking in the glow of the
                    World War II experience. During World War II the Germans, the Nazis, had been
                    very influential in Argentina, which had its Peronist populist government, a
                    government that felt a certain kinship with the Fascists in Italy. Brazil and
                    Argentina had traditionally been rivals. The US went a long way to make sure
                    that Brazil stayed on our side during World War II. Brazil had a division of
                    troops in Italy. A lot of personal alliances were formed between the United
                    States armed forces and Brazilian armed forces at that time. All of us benefited
                    from that and, since the military were always terribly important in Brazil, that
                    kind of aura of good feeling spread widely in Brazil. Basically, the US was
                    regarded as a major ally. Brazil was regarded by the Brazilians as a big country
                    which had done its share in World War II and merited respect as an ally. As long
                    as we played that right, we couldn't do anything wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this coup d'�tat developed, you were in a state where
                        the military was opposed to the military in other states. Did anybody come
                        to you and ask how the United States felt about this, or were you just
                        finding out what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It was more a matter of my finding out what was going on. It was their
                    problem and, from my point of view, I made it plain that it was their problem.
                    They agreed. They knew they had to resolve it for themselves somehow. The
                    Embassy wasn't trying to tell me to get the people in southern Brazil to give
                    up, hand over their swords, or whatever it was. I was just expected to report on
                    what was going on. Reporting was difficult, because all communications with the
                    other part of Brazil were cut off. I communicated with the Embassy via ITT
                    Telegram to the US and Washington, using my One-Time Pad. Washington would then
                    relay my reporting to the Embassy in Rio, because I couldn't communicate
                    directly with Rio, either by telephone or by telegram. That meant a lot of work
                    with the One-Time Pads. I never wanted to use one again.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Alliance for Progress was announced at Punta del Este, Uruguay in
                    August, 1961. I left Curitiba in October, 1961, after a coup d'�tat which took
                    place at the beginning of September, 1961. So people in Curitiba hadn't had time
                    to focus on the Alliance for Progress.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any reflection about President Kennedy,

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: People loved the Kennedy's. They thought that they were wonderful. They
                    really did. Some of the talk was about whether there was “another Roosevelt” in
                    the United States, because they liked Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Good
                    Neighbor Policy. However, you cannot overstate the importance of their positive
                    feelings toward the US following World War II. And that carried over.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: Not at that time. I first met Vernon Walters when he was a Major in the
                    Army. He accompanied an American group which came back with the victorious
                    Brazilian division from Italy in 1945 right after the end of World War II. He
                    came out to the American School in Rio and talked to us. I was in the ninth
                    grade and I met him. He didn't remember me from then. He didn't go back to
                    Brazil as Military Attach� until some time after I had left Brazil.</p>

                        This was your first post and obviously a difficult one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: And it was non-stop. You see, we did not have home leave between our
                    assignments to Recife and Curitiba. We arrived in Brazil in January, 1958. My
                    wife left in September, 1961. I left in October, 1961. There had been no home
                    leave, and that had been a surprise. My wife was terribly homesick by that time.
                    We had tentatively been assigned to Sweden. I was to be in the Political Section
                    in Stockholm. However, at the beginning of 1961 the United States broke
                    relations with Cuba. The Personnel system had to place a number of people coming
                    out of Havana. So the Stockholm assignment went to someone from Havana. They
                    couldn't figure out what to do with me because they were placing people from
                    Havana. Eventually, I was succeeded in Curitiba by a consular officer who had
                    been in Havana.</p>
                <p>In the end I was reassigned to Washington. I was made a staff assistant to the
                    Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of American
                    Republics Affairs (ARA), the part of the Department of State responsible for our
                    relations with Latin America. I reported for duty on a Friday morning as soon as
                    I arrived from Brazil. I was told that I would have to defer my home leave
                    another two or three months because we were getting ready for a major
                    inter-American conference in February 1962. The conference was supposed to
                    follow up on the August 1961 Punta del Este conference and flesh out the
                    Alliance for Progress. But we also intended to direct it against Fidel Castro. I
                    was told that the Staff Assistant was an indispensable person. They couldn't
                    possibly survive if I had even two days' leave. They did allow me a long
                    weekend. I was to report for duty on Monday to work for Wym DeRenne Coerr, who
                    was the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for American Republics Affairs.
                    Monday morning The Washington Post announced a major earthquake in ARA. All the
                    DAS's [Deputy Assistant Secretaries] or Wym Coerr, at least, had been booted
                    out. Ed Martin was the Assistant Secretary for ARA, and the new Principal Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary was Richard Goodwin, one time speechwriter for President
                    Kennedy. He came right straight out of the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a real, sort of character.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ROWELL: A real character. So I walked into the ARA front office, not having a
                    clue as to what a Staff Assistant does to meet the new Principal Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary who also didn't have a clue as to what a Principal Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary does, but who was suspicious of the career Foreign Service
                    and the State Department in general. He felt that he had been put in that very
                    sensitive position to make sure that the Alliance for Progress went right, that
                    the State Department didn't screw up, and to make sure that the White House was
                    well informed about everything that was going on.</p>
                <p>So [DAS] Goodwin said to me, “What's your job?” I said, “I'm your Staff
                    Assistant. What am I supposed to do?” He looked at me, and I looked at him, and
                    he said, “Why don't you tell me how the Alliance for Progress is supposed to
                    work?” Now, I knew that he had written the Alliance for Progress speech for
                    President Kennedy, so I repeated back to him whatever had come to us in the
                    Wireless File about this. I said, “This is the Alliance for Progress, as I
                    understand it.” He said, “Mmm. Well, I've got a couple of things for you to do.”
                    He was setting up some dinners at the White House. Soon I found myself sitting
                    in a phone booth at the Mayflower Hotel, trying to get through to Pablo Casals
                    in London, via the White House switchboard and a few other places, to get the
                    “right sort of atmosphere” going for Jackie [Jacqueline Kennedy]. This was
                    apparently a job which Goodwin had brought with him from the White House.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I was supposed to give him some kind of document on the meaning
                    of the Alliance for Progress. I said to myself, “You know, I think that this guy
                    may be a wonderful speechwriter, but he doesn't know what he was saying.”
                    However, it was a cinch that I, coming out of Curitiba, Brazil, didn't know what
                    he should have been saying, either. [Laughter] I started looking around to find
                    somebody who might have an idea about what we should say about the Alliance for
                    Progress at the coming Inter-American Conference. Meanwhile, my relationship
                    with Goodwin was definitively rocky. He really didn't know what to do with me,
                    and I didn't know what to do with myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what I had heard, he wasn't well received in the
                        State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There was a precipitating event. He decided to bring to the United States
                    someone whose name I don't remember now. I don't even remember the country of
                    origin of this person. I half remember, but I'd rather not say it. This was
                    somebody who was either a guerrilla or a communist, or suspected of being both.
                    Goodwin decided that it would be a good idea to have a face to face conversation
                    with that person somewhere in the US, to make a personal judgment about that
                    person which he could relate directly to President Kennedy. He began to set up
                    this meeting clandestinely. He was doing this without telling anyone in the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including you, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, except that I knew. I overheard him, and he let me know. He really
                    didn't try to hide it from me that much. He admonished me not to tell anybody in
                    the State Department. That gave me a serious problem of conscience and judgment.
                    I believed profoundly that to conduct a clandestine operation, involving a
                    notorious personage, without vetting it with some of the people who had been
                    dealing with that problem or with that personage, was crazy. A well run
                    establishment doesn't do that. I knew that all kinds of things could go wrong,
                    including for the President. On the other hand, I knew I should be loyal to my
                    boss and be worthy of his trust — that is, keep the confidences that he passed
                    on to me.</p>
                <p>In the end I ignored Goodwin's admonition and talked with the office director for
                    that part of ARA. The office director then took me to Ed Martin, the Assistant
                    Secretary for ARA, and I told him what was going on. They dealt with it, and the
                    next day I discovered that I no longer had a job with Goodwin and I was no
                    longer a staff assistant. [Laughter] I was called in by the ARA Bureau Executive
                    Director, told that in three months I would become the Desk Officer for Honduras
                    — the least of the desks — and that in the meantime I was attached to Bill
                    Bowdler [Deputy Assistant Secretary for ARA] to prepare for the anti-Fidel
                    Castro part of the pending Inter-American Conference.</p>
                <p>I still wouldn't have done anything different. It was a crazy way to run a
                    railroad, and I knew that. In the event, I came out all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to Goodwin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He later went somewhere else, and I don't remember where. However, he
                    remained in that job a good long while, until the Kennedy assassination, I
                    believe. Eventually, Goodwin's relationships in ARA settled down. Ed Martin, the
                    Assistant Secretary of State for ARA, was a very savvy guy. He had been a
                    Washington operator since the late 1930's. He had been a part of the Roosevelt
                    Brain Trust. He came to Washington as one of its junior members. He knew how to
                    manage things and he knew how to get the confidence of people in the White House
                    — the confidence that he needed. When he had that, as he did during the Cuba
                    Missile Crisis, he was the guy in the White House, not Richard Goodwin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, I recall that in one of my interviews somebody
                        said, regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis, that Goodwin was in Mexico and
                        sent a message to the Department, asking, “Should I come back?” The answer
                        was, “Why don't you stay there and take care of what you are doing?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Ed Martin had established his authority and, in terms of my own career
                    progress, I had a very good relationship with Martin.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking about this early period of your
                        Washington assignment after Brazil. You were the new boy on the block. You
                        had come back to ARA, the front office of the Bureau. Although you were
                        busy, you probably had lunch with your fellow officers and all of that. Did
                        you get any feeling how the Foreign Service establishment, and particularly
                        that section of it dealing with ARA, thought about the Kennedy
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In ARA everything was up. President Kennedy had made the Alliance for
                    Progress one of the central elements of his foreign policy. This meant that
                    there would be resources to support it. It meant that there would be prestigious
                    assignments. ARA was a very good place to be. You could go out to any country in
                    the Western Hemisphere, have practically any job, and it would be noticed.
                    Somebody would be able to write an efficiency report on you that said, “This man
                    (or woman) went off to Brazil (or Argentina or Bolivia), carrying out the
                    President's Number One foreign policy priority, the Alliance for Progress.”
                    Everybody understood that that was the first priority. If you were in a “third
                    world” (1960s terminology) area, ARA was a good one to be in during that time.
                    So morale in ARA was high.</p>
                <p>ARA was also where we did our first experiment with amalgamating AID [Agency for
                    International Development] and State. This process went through a couple of
                    stages. The first stage was the most complete. We later called it the “belly to
                    belly”. We were literally, totally amalgamated, so that the Office of Central
                    American Affairs, where I was, had as its first Director a State Department
                    officer and an AID officer as its Deputy Director. Every desk was a merged desk.
                    Where AID and State officers had been in separate offices, we were now in
                    combined offices. The desks were adjacent. In one case the AID officer was the
                    principal Desk Officer, and the State officer was his assistant. In others, it
                    was the reverse. My efficiency report was written by an AID officer and reviewed
                    by a State Department officer. I wrote the efficiency report on the AID officer
                    who was my deputy. It was reviewed by the AID Deputy Director of the office.</p>
                <p>When it came time to argue the AID budget before all the arcane elements of the
                    AID establishment, I did it. When it came time to prepare for hearings on the
                    Hill [before Congress], if there was something about the area that I was
                    responsible for, I had to be on the Hill. Now, the AID officer might also be
                    there. When I went on vacation, the AID officer was the State Department Desk
                    Officer and had to write the briefing memoranda for the Assistant Secretary and
                    for the Secretary of State. It was total integration. I can tell you that I
                    learned how AID works, I learned a lot about the budget process, I learned a lot
                    about the appropriations and other congressional processes. All of this proved
                    invaluable to me, time and time again. It reinforced that very first A-100
                    lesson we had, that we are the Foreign Service of the United States, and not
                    just of some agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the AID people come out of a different culture? Was
                        this apparent? Did you see a difference? I'm talking about your level at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ROWELL: At my level? Yes, the developmental culture is different from that of the
                    classic political officer culture. The classic political officer is interested
                    in understanding political dynamics and power relationships, in having access to
                    power brokers. The development officer is classically interested in alleviating
                    human ills on a permanent basis. That's what drives development officers. Since
                    I came from a missionary family, I felt a lot of kinship with development
                    officers. Alleviating human ills is one of the motivations that pulled me into
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I mentioned a couple of those motivations. It is worth repeating them now. I
                    entered the Foreign Service for adventure, to serve my country, and to serve and
                    help people. In other words, some of the missionary mentality is still in me.
                    There was a fourth reason, which I should have mentioned a long time ago. The
                    Foreign Service was one of the few professions that I knew where a spouse could
                    be a full partner. That was the bait that finally persuaded my wife to go
                    through the agony of Recife, because she could be my partner, as she certainly
                    was when she came home and told me in Curitiba that there was going to be a coup
                    d'�tat that weekend. She knew exactly what she was hearing and knew what to do
                    with it.</p>

                        Ed Rowell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: So ARA was a totally integrated, AID-State operation. I enjoyed dealing
                    with development problems, as I say, because I still have some missionary in me.
                    I understood political analysis and policy problems. It was a fantastic
                    educational experience. I can tell you this. It helped me to think like a
                    manager. You define objectives and set goals very concretely. Then you design
                    implementing actions, and you rate people on the results of their work, not just
                    on the amount of effort they put out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How new was this integration of AID and State when you
                        arrived on the Honduran desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was implemented while I was on the desk. Not too long after I left the
                    Honduran desk in August, 1964, the combined AID-State offices were separated in
                    an organizational sense. Physically they were no longer completely integrated,
                    but they remained in adjacent offices. The AID There no longer was a
                    hierarchical relationship between them. I was there when there was a
                    hierarchical relationship between the individuals of the separate agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were new to this arrangement, but it fit your
                        personality. However, at a different level, people who had been used to
                        doing things one way may have found it difficult to get used to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Among those of us doing the work, the desk officers, the office directors
                    and deputy office directors, there wasn't that much grumbling. Yes, there was an
                    initial shock. However, after about six or seven months everybody settled down
                    and did their jobs. One of the things that drives the Foreign Service is that we
                    like our work and become totally absorbed in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We wouldn't have an Oral History Program if we didn't
                        enjoy our work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. As soon as people settled down, began to do their work, saw
                    that they could produce real results, and appreciated each other as good,
                    qualified, and well-motivated persons, they were all for this new arrangement.
                    There were a lot more civil servants doing professional jobs on the AID side
                    than there had been on the State side. It didn't make any difference. We just
                    worked together.</p>
                <p>Where it caused anguish was in the Office of the Executive Director of ARA, which
                    was responsible for managing the money and keeping track of the property and
                    furnishings and whom they belonged to. Running the efficiency report process
                    also was complicated. And, to some extent, at the Assistant Secretary level
                    there was some friction. The AID Assistant Administrator for ARA theoretically
                    reported to the corresponding Assistant Secretary of State. In fact, he really
                    had to report to the AID Administrator because it was the only integrated
                    operation between the two agencies. Nowhere else in the world did this system
                    apply. That's where the stress lines lay, not farther down the line.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Honduran Desk Officer from 1962 to 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you saw it, what were American interests in Honduras
                        during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We hoped that, somehow or other, a democratic structure could be made to
                    work. Honduras had a long history of coups d'�tat. We wanted to prevent the
                    communists from taking over the proletariat or setting up organized labor.
                    Principal US investment interests were with the United Fruit and Standard Fruit
                    Companies, plus some minor mining and fishing companies. Most important was to
                    prevent the communists from getting a foothold in Central America which would
                    allow them to threaten the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>What kind of a threat could that be? Well, since Cuba had gone communist and
                    since there had been Soviet missiles deployed in Cuba, which were aimed at the
                    United States, anything was possible. The difference between Cuba and Central
                    America is that Central America has a land bridge to the US That could mean more
                    opportunities for infiltration and many more opportunities, from a base in
                    Central America, to send more indigenous people into Mexico and destabilize
                    Mexico. And we have a 2,000-mile long frontier with Mexico.</p>
                <p>The programs to deal with these concerns involved a major labor program which
                    United Fruit and Standard Fruit barely choked down. Our Labor Attach� in
                    Tegucigalpa was working with the AFL/CIO [American Federation of Labor/Congress
                    of Industrial Organizations] to organize a democratic labor structure and
                    preempt communist efforts to take over labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I don't remember the name. He was working with the American Institute for
                    Free Labor Development [AIFLD], which had a representative in Honduras. We were
                    encouraging the unionization of the banana workers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We had identified some leaders among the banana workers who were not
                    communists but who wanted to take good care of the banana workers. We were
                    supporting them and helping them to organize. We were successful. In effect, we
                    immunized the banana workers against the communists. The free labor movement
                    leaders took over. They set up a labor structure which did not simply rely on
                    the government and on government pressure. They got help from AIFLD in
                    negotiations with the banana companies. It cost the banana companies a little
                    bit of money. There were a couple of strikes—none of them very long. In the end
                    the fruit companies wound up with a labor structure that was far more reliable
                    and trustworthy than they had in most of the rest of Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived on the Honduran desk, what was the word
                        in the corridors about the United Fruit and Standard Fruit Companies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ROWELL: The corridor gossip was that these companies ran feudal fiefdoms. The
                    banana workers were regarded as plantation workers. They were working on land
                    owned by the banana companies. The banana plantations were enormous. The workers
                    bought their supplies from the company store, their housing was company
                    provided, with rents set by the company, and they were permanently indentured
                    workers. Their housing was a little bit better than for a subsistence farmer up
                    in the hills. There was a little more medical treatment, there was a little more
                    electricity and running water, but the living certainly wasn't grand.</p>
                <p>When I first became involved in Central America, the banana companies were, of
                    course, trying to keep their costs down. They were trying to treat their workers
                    decently by local standards, which weren't very high. By American standards they
                    looked awful, but by local standards it didn't look that bad. For the most part
                    their middle and upper management wanted to be humane. For example, they built
                    some new worker housing with a loan which they got partly from the Alliance for
                    Progress program. The housing was designed by American architects and was
                    inappropriate for that tropical area. Houses had ground and second floors. The
                    workers didn't like these houses and thought that the company was treating them
                    badly. The problem was that nobody had checked into the local culture of these
                    people, who were used to slinging hammocks underneath grass huts built on
                    stilts. That's where they got a breeze which cooled the air enough to sleep at
                    night. That's where they kept the pig, the chickens, and the calf.</p>
                <p>So the next time around we said, “Let's talk with these people about how they
                    want to live before we build the housing.” We did so, and the next set of
                    housing went over very well. All of this wasn't because the fruit company was
                    badly intentioned. It was that they got off on the wrong foot, using architects
                    who didn't know the conditions that they were designing the houses for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What things were you involved in, as desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I was involved in the preparation of the usual briefing papers. There was
                    a coup d'�tat in Honduras while I was on the desk. We withdrew our Ambassador.
                    In fact, the Ambassador was still away when President Kennedy was assassinated
                    in November, 1963. Ed Martin was still Assistant Secretary for ARA. I remember
                    having to go to him and say, “The time has come for us to recognize this
                    Honduran government. If we don't recognize it, then some military people may get
                    in and cause us all kinds of problems.” This was the day of President Kennedy's
                    funeral [November 25, 1963]. I did a pro-con for and against paper with all of
                    the reasons why to recognize the Honduran government and all of the reasons why
                    not to do so. I concluded that there was no way to guarantee that this would
                    work out. I did my best to present both pro's and con's. I think that it was
                    that list which won me Ed Martin's respect more than anything else. The reason
                    that I was in a meeting with Ed is that I gave the list to the office director.
                    He thought it was a good list and made sure that I went with him to see Ed
                    Martin, so that Ed would understand who had prepared the list.</p>
                <p>Ed said, “No, that's going to have to wait.” And we survived. He wasn't about to
                    try to get to the Secretary of State Dean Rusk or the President Lyndon Johnson
                    on this issue on that day.</p>
                <p>So I dealt with the coup and the memoranda which needed to be prepared,
                    indicating the various stages of the coup. I dealt with the constant tensions
                    between the banana companies and the Honduran Government, as well as between the
                    banana companies and the US Government over the labor development program. I
                    dealt with the labor development program, the AFL/CIO, and the American
                    Institute for Free Labor Development. I backed up our posts. I worked with the
                    AID desk officer to prepare all of the program documents going to OMB [Office of
                    Management and Budget] on budget issues. I prepared the testimony for the
                    appropriations and authorization hearings. I also backstopped the desk officers
                    for Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. In that part of
                    the world at that time there was almost always a political drama or a natural
                    disaster — volcano, flood or hurricane — going on somewhere.</p>
                <p>When anybody was sick or out of the office, we were really spread thin. There was
                    one time when I was covering five countries at once. I can tell you, it was
                    crazy — total madness. It was during the preparations for the AID budget
                    hearings. Besides the coup in Honduras, a volcano went off in Costa Rica, and
                    there was an earthquake in Guatemala.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I want to go back to the coup for a moment and talk about our Embassy's
                    performance. As was generally the case in Latin America, we had plenty of early
                    warning that something was brewing. Warning came from the CIA station, from our
                    Military Attach� and our military assistance group, and from some of the people
                    who talked regularly with the Foreign Service officers at the Embassy. I don't
                    recall the formal pretext, but conservative land-owning elements in the country
                    feared that the moderate democratic forces then running the country — the
                    Liberal Party — would let too many ordinary folk into the national political
                    equation. The landowners, mostly associated with the National Party, had plenty
                    of friends and relatives in the military. There had been many instructions from
                    Washington to the Embassy to warn the conservatives and the military against a
                    coup. The coup came anyway. In the aftermath our Ambassador, Charles Burrows,
                    who was withdrawn immediately after the coup, discovered that both the CIA
                    station chief and the Military Attach� had separately hinted to their respective
                    Honduran contacts that they didn't have to pay attention to what the Ambassador
                    or the State Department were saying; in the end the United States would accept a
                    coup as a fait accompli and conduct business as usual with the new authorities.
                    The CIA reassigned the station chief to the United States and I don't know what
                    became of him. The Military Attach� was sent to a small Reserve Officer Training
                    Corps program in Idaho and forced into retirement after about two years.
                    Ambassador Burrows also retired not too much later. I think one reason why Ed
                    Martin held back so long on recognizing the new government — we waited several
                    months — was that he was delivering a message both to the other agencies in
                    Washington an to would-be coup plotters throughout the hemisphere: what the US
                    Ambassador says is what counts. Don't be misled by what some other officer in a
                    US Embassy says if that officer is saying something different from announced US
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that is almost an article of faith in
                        the academic world and elsewhere is that American economic interests, and
                        certainly in Central America, in this case, bananas, drive our foreign
                        policy. Here you were, right in the belly of the beast and you seem to be
                        saying that the main issue was keeping the communists out of the area, more
                        than anything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In effect, that consideration took precedence over the interests of the
                    banana companies. That's correct. But the interests of the banana companies came
                    next. Yes. That was typical of the Cold War. If you had a conflict between a
                    national economic interest and a national security interest, the security
                    interest took precedence. In the event we had to arrange things so that the
                    security interest didn't damage the banana companies — and, in fact, it didn't.
                    The banana companies ran into far fewer labor problems with the union which the
                    AFL/CIO was able to establish in Honduras than they ran into with their unions
                    in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. They had serious strikes in Nicaragua and Costa
                    Rica. They never had them in Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the AFL/CIO representation
                        that you dealt with? I would think that they would look on you with
                        suspicion, as with the United Fruit Company. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>ROWELL: No, because AID was financing the labor program. The AFL/CIO people knew
                    that I had to argue in favor of that financing and so had to support it. I was
                    simply a government official responsible for getting the money that allowed them
                    to run at Uncle Sam's expense a program that they dearly wanted to undertake. I
                    also had a very good relationship with the Washington representative of the
                    United Fruit Company, Jasper Baker, because I was also responsible for helping
                    United Fruit when it had problems with the Honduran government. Frankly, the
                    fact that we had a good relationship with the union and that the union had a lot
                    of members who voted in the elections helped us a lot with the government,
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government situation during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, as I said, there was a coup d'�tat. A military officer was in
                    charge of the government, but the government was essentially civilian, not
                    military. The officer was from the National (conservative) Party. Basically, the
                    Honduran government just sort of muddled through. They wanted to live their
                    lives in reasonable comfort without too much excitement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that in Honduras, rather than a few families
                        running things, it was more a matter of leaders who came up through the
                        military taking over. Is that fair to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, no. There were a few influential families which also provided the
                    officers for the military. It was a very small group of families that ran
                    things. They had done so for years and years. Even those in the opposition were
                    from this elite group of families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any tie with Cuba? I mean, a Cuba connection
                        which was of concern to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There were reports, from time to time, of Cuban agents coming ashore in
                    Honduras, trying to help the Communist Party of Honduras and trying to
                    infiltrate the labor movement and get a communist opposition started within the
                    labor movement. However, basically there wasn't much to it. The Honduran
                    communists were not terribly effective. We would watch them, but they made
                    mistakes. Frankly, Cuba wasn't making that much of an effort in Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Mexico? Did Mexico play much of a role that you
                        were watching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. Mexico pays a lot more attention to Guatemala and, to a lesser
                    extent, to El Salvador. Most of the time it really paid very little attention to
                    the other Central American countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The history of Central America is a history of abandonment. It was abandoned by
                    the Spanish crown after the Napoleonic wars. The Central American countries got
                    an independence that they didn't ask for. They tried to stay together as a
                    Central American Union. They couldn't do it. Distance just made it too easy for
                    local self-appointed Army colonels to take over. It has always been a distressed
                    area. It had a hard time living on its own, and nobody wanted to help it live.

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was talking to someone who had been US Ambassador to
                        Costa Rica a little bit later. He said that the biggest state visit that
                        they had was when a Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi had to land there and
                        wasn't quite sure where he was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Occasionally, other things happened. There was the issue of the bay
                    islands, which belonged to Honduras and were off the North coast of the country
                    in the Caribbean Sea. This was a favorite watering place for snowbirds from
                    Minnesota, including major corporate executives. They would come down in their
                    corporate jets and visit the bay islands. Every so often one of these jets would
                    bump into one of the mountains in Honduras, and we would have a nasty, consular
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>One other issue was resolved while I was minding Honduran affairs. In the
                    nineteenth century the United States claimed a pair of small islands in the
                    Caribbean north of Honduras — the Swan Islands. They were uninhabited when we
                    claimed them. They had deep piles of guano, bird droppings used for fertilizer.
                    Some people set themselves up on the island to dig out the guano and sell it.
                    Honduras also claimed the islands on grounds that they had originally been
                    discovered by Spain and that Honduras had inherited them when it and the rest of
                    Central America had become independent early in the nineteenth century. In the
                    twentieth century the US had put up a lighthouse, and we had a radio navigation
                    and communications center there. By the time I arrived at the Honduran desk we
                    had acknowledged that Honduras had a right to the islands. We still were running
                    communication and weather facilities there, but technology had made them
                    unnecessary and obsolete. The continued US use of the islands was one of those
                    issues that anyone could exploit to detonate anti-US activity on the mainland. A
                    plan to hand full responsibility back to Honduras was well advanced by the time
                    I left the desk. A transfer ceremony was held before the end of the decade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, then I'd like to put on the end of the tape
                        that we'll pick up in 1964, when you went to Stanford University to take
                        Latin American studies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Right. One other thing about my time on the Honduras desk. While
                    President Kennedy was still in office, he participated in a major Inter-American
                    conference in Costa Rica. I went to San Jos�, Costa Rica, as part of the advance
                    party and stayed for the whole event. It was my first experience in dealing with
                    matters where a President is going to be involved. I discovered all of the crazy
                    nonsense that goes on. Every detail is frantically scrubbed from policy to hot
                    water bottles. If one person minding minor details at one event is good, three
                    are much better. The military call it redundancy. It's intended to make sure
                    nothing remotely distracting could intrude on the President if, heaven forbid,
                    something (traveler's tummy?) should happen to one of the bit players minding a
                    minor piece of logistics or whatever. Everybody is prepared to answer every
                    question and do anything at any moment. There is frantic running around triple
                    checking. And then you have endless hours, staying up late, watching a telephone
                    that never rings, hoping some duty issue or another will emerge to break the
                    fatigue and boredom. It is a very, very expensive way to do things. It needs a
                    lot of improvement. However, San Jos� was useful for me, in the sense that I
                    understood the anxiety that tends to permeate all of the President's aides,
                    including the highest ranking ones. And their anxiety gets transferred further
                    down to the lowest ranking people around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the White House staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ROWELL: The White House staff was imbued with its own importance. That seems to
                    be natural with White House staffs. It certainly was true of the Kennedy White
                    House staff. It was “Camelot,” and they all knew that they were “knights of the
                    Round Table.” Most of them thought that they were Sir Lancelot himself. So that
                    when you dealt with them, every one of them had a personality. But each one of
                    them knew also that the boss was President Kennedy and that the alternate boss
                    was Attorney General Bobby Kennedy. That was it.</p>
                <p>In fact, going back earlier, there was a coup in Honduras which I referred to
                    before and which may have related in part to the Kennedy visit to Costa Rica,
                    although I don't remember at this point. I started receiving phone calls from
                    Ralph Dungan, asking for information which basically would enable him to second
                    guess Ed Martin, the Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Dungan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Dungan headed the National Security Council staff. If he didn't head it,
                    he was the ARA person on the National Security Council staff. He was a man whom
                    President Kennedy knew personally and with whom Kennedy talked personally. I
                    would get these calls. Dungan would call me at 8:00 PM, 7:00 AM, or whenever it
                    was. I would answer his questions, but I got to the point where I was taking
                    written notes and then transcribing them and taking them up to Ed Martin so that
                    he wouldn't be blind sided or have Dungan end run him. Ralph was very good at
                    handling the information. I never got into trouble with him. He continued to
                    call me. For me he was always “Mr. Dungan.”</p>
                <p>In a way this situation paralleled my initial experience with Richard Goodwin.
                    This is a kind of situation which repeats itself forever in the State
                    Department. The lesson is that a disciplined service and a disciplined
                    structure, which is responsible for managing the operation over the long haul,
                    has to retain its internal integrity.</p>
                <p>—</p>

                        interview with Ambassador Ed Rowell. Ed, we're in Washington in the 1960's.
                        You were talking about Ralph Dungan...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We left off after talking about my contacts with Ralph Dungan. I was the
                    Officer in Charge of Honduran Affairs. I was the back up officer for several of
                    the other, Central American countries. I worked side by side with an AID officer
                    who had similar responsibilities for the same geographic territory.</p>
                <p>I left Washington in the summer of 1964 for a year of graduate study at Stanford
                    University in Palo Alto, California, where I specialized in Latin American area
                    studies.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about that. You were at Stanford in
                        1964-1965. What did you think of Stanford and their approach to Latin
                        America. Here you were, an experienced Foreign Service Officer. Did you feel
                        that their approach to Latin America was a bit theoretical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The FSI [Foreign Service Institute] had a string of universities to which
                    it sent persons who were going into Latin American area studies. Stanford
                    University was one, the University of Wisconsin was another, the University of
                    Texas another, and the University of Florida at Gainesville was still another. I
                    think FSI also may have used at least one university in the northeastern US. I
                    chose Stanford because it was close to where I grew up in California. In the
                    Foreign Service you don't get to stay at home very often. So that's where I
                    went.</p>
                <p>My mentor at Stanford at the time was Professor John J. Johnson, who had
                    specialized in the military and their role in Latin American history. Under the
                    rules at the Graduate School at Stanford you had to take a minimum of 10 credit
                    hours per quarter. Johnson actively sought the presence of Foreign Service
                    officers to provide leavening for his other graduate students. So he would give
                    the Foreign Service people attending Stanford 10 credit hours in directed
                    reading seminars. Then we were free to take any other courses that we
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>Typically, I took the two Johnson courses. We would have to give reports on at
                    least two or three books a week. There were three Foreign Service officers in a
                    seminar of about ten people. By the time we Foreign Service types got into the
                    rhythm and got caught up with what had been happening since we'd graduated from
                    university a decade earlier, we moved to reporting on five books a week. We had
                    to do a thumbnail report on each one, which Johnson then turned around and used
                    in his own writings for the publication of the American Academy of
                    Historiography.</p>
                <p>The other courses I took were in subjects such as Economic Problems of Latin

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I don't recall that it was. Stanford, at least, was still very much
                    focused on power brokers. This meant the military or people who had amassed
                    substantial fortunes. However, the Alliance for Progress was still going.</p>

                        questions about our supporting all of these dictators and that type of
                        thing, or did that come later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I think that that was a later phenomenon. There had been the problem of
                    the government of President Arbenz in Guatemala in the mid 1950's — that was
                    before I entered the Foreign Service. At that point in the 1960's when I was at
                    Stanford, Somoza was still in power in Nicaragua, and he had been there for a
                    long time. Stroessner was in power in Paraguay, and he had also been there for a
                    long time. Costa Rica was doing reasonably well. Argentina was in one of its
                    good phases. The Brazilian military had sort of steered that country astray in
                    terms of democracy and all of that. But it wasn't proving to be a great problem.
                    There was no terrible wave of repression in Brazil, as I recall. However, I
                    hadn't been in Brazil since 1961 and I wasn't talking regularly with anyone who
                    was there. What attracted our attention was the situation in the Dominican
                    Republic, when we landed some Marines ashore from an assault carrier to put down
                    an anti-democratic aberration. Another issue was Vietnam, because it was in
                    April, 1965, that President Johnson announced that we were going into Vietnam on
                    a large scale. But we were not yet there in large scale, and the large-scale
                    demonstrations, violence and loss of faith in government that characterized the
                    late 1960s and 1970s had not yet emerged.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: No, nothing special. The Bay of Pigs incident of 1961 was long since gone
                    from public attention. Cuba was Cuba.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: June, 1965. I was assigned to the Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I
                    had no workable Spanish. So I was assigned to the FSI for four or five weeks,
                    the maximum amount of time I could be given that would allow me to get to Buenos
                    Aires to be useful from the point of view of the Political Counselor and the DCM
                    [Deputy Chief of Mission].</p>
                <p>I arrived at the Foreign Service Institute. I said, “I already speak Portuguese
                    and you have already tested me in that. Now I need to speak Spanish.” They
                    started to give me, in knee jerk fashion, their usual four-to-six month course.
                    I said, “No, I don't have time to waste on that.” They said, “Well, you'll have
                    to take that course, because otherwise you won't learn Spanish properly.” So I
                    said, “Test me.” The first thing that they wanted me to do was to sit at home
                    and listen to endless tapes on how to pronounce Spanish. I said, “I think that I
                    can pronounce Spanish. Give me a tape and have me read something. I may not
                    understand what it says, but I think that I can pronounce it.” And I could. They
                    said, “Well, all right, we'll get rid of those tapes.” It interested them that I
                    didn't mispronounce Spanish the way a Brazilian would. That's what they were
                    afraid of — not my American accent but my Brazilian accent.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>They finally turned loose a linguist who listened to me and listened to my
                    Portuguese. Then he said, “All right.” And they created a special program for
                    me. I went out and bought some books at one of the university bookstores,
                    probably at George Washington University. I brought them in. They gave me a
                    special class, which involved one linguist, one language instructor, and one
                    student left over from the previous Spanish language course who still didn't
                    have an onward assignment. That person could act as a foil. In five weeks I was
                    at the 3 - 3 level [speaking level 3 - useful; reading level 3 - useful],
                    because they paid attention to converting my Portuguese, rather than just
                    teaching me Spanish from scratch. That was the genesis of the present language
                    instruction which converts Spanish to Portuguese or Portuguese to Spanish. That
                    is the six-week program that they have.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sparked their interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That was it, and I got it simply by telling them that I would not accept
                    just what they wanted to hand me. They had a responsibility to me and the
                    Foreign Service and they had to show me that they were trying to meet it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Argentina from when to when.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We were there from the end of July or early August, 1965, to August 1,
                    1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Argentina when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It had a democratic government. President Ilia had assumed office,
                    succeeding President Frondizi some three or four years before. The country had
                    some economic problems, the government was running some serious deficits, and
                    the labor unions were getting restive. A year after I arrived, there was a coup
                    d'�tat. The coup was so widely anticipated and so little opposed by the public
                    that it was an extraordinarily peaceful event.</p>
                <p>The usual group of military armored cars arrived in front of the office of the
                    Presidency, the Casa Rosada. A senior general walked in in full uniform and told
                    the President that he was out of a job. The colonel commanding the Presidential
                    Guard, the San Martin Guard, which has always been extremely loyal to
                    Argentina's Presidents, entered the President's office and said, “Mr. President,
                    we're prepared to defend you.” President Ilia turned to him and said, “There's
                    no point in wasting anybody's blood. Colonel, have your forces withdraw from
                    around here. I'm sure that General So-and-So will make sure that I'm personally
                    safe. Isn't that so, General?” The coup leaders gave the President and his wife
                    some time to collect their personal possessions, their clothing, and so forth.
                    They then escorted Ilia to his personal home in a Buenos Aires suburb called
                    “Olivos” [Olive Trees].</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>They posted a guard at his house to protect him from the press and the curious.
                    He was not restricted in any way in any of his movements. There were lots of
                    gawkers in front of his house. The international press arrived and wanted to
                    know what was going on. I recall that we were being badgered by Washington and
                    by The New York Times which said that President Ilia was “locked up” and was
                    “virtually a prisoner,” and “what are you doing about it?” “How did this happen,
                    and tell us all the dirt.”</p>
                <p>The truth was that President Ilia and his administration had become enormously
                    unpopular. In the style of things at that point in the 20th century the military
                    would normally produce an interim President, which is what they did. There were
                    great hopes that Ongan�a would somehow have a more disciplined administration
                    and that the government finances would be better handled. In fact, it didn't
                    work that way. After a couple of years, Ongan�a was out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's back up a bit. What was your position when you
                        arrived in Buenos Aires?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I've forgotten whether I was a First or Second Secretary in the Embassy.
                    I was in the Political Section, which consisted of the Political Counselor, a
                    deputy Chief of Section, two other Political Officers, including myself, and a
                    Labor Attach�. As the most recently arrived, more junior officer in the
                    Political Section, I handled a lot of the cats and dogs [miscellaneous issues]
                    —terrorists, fringe religious groups, and that sort of thing. I tried to follow
                    them. And, of course, I handled the WEEKA. [The WEEKA] was a weekly report in
                    which you said what had been going on in brief form.</p>
                <p>The Political Counselor, Pete Rabenold, was a real task master. He said, “All
                    right, we have to turn these things [i. e., the WEEKA's] out, but they will
                    never exceed two pages.” During my time in Buenos Aires it was more than two
                    pages long only once, when Pete was away on vacation, and I let it run two lines
                    over two pages. I was hung out to dry for two weeks when he returned. He said,
                    “I said it, and I meant it.” I learned a little more about Foreign Service
                    discipline, and about concise, well focused reporting. It was the kind of
                    learning experience I should have had in Brazil, but never got because I was
                    only in small consulates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Ed Martin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was “Mr. ARA,” in a way. You arrived there a year
                        before the coup d'�tat. When you got there, what were you saying in the
                        Embassy about the Argentine government, and what were you hearing from the
                        people who had been there and were reporting on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Oh, the other junior officer, Elkin Taylor, had come into the Foreign
                    Service with a journalism background. He was covering the Argentine Congress and
                    the main line political parties. He knew everybody. He knew all of the political
                    commentators. He spent a lot of time down at Congress, and he had a pretty good
                    lock on what was happening. The Labor Attach�, Jim Shea, also was very, very
                    good and knew virtually everyone in the labor movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Labor was very important there in Buenos Aires.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Peron movement was based on its organized labor foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how was Peronism seen at that time? Was it
                        seen...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: People hated it. Peron had been kicked out of the Presidency in 1955. It
                    had been a bloody event, and they didn't want the Peronistas to get back into
                    power. That was one of the problems. Labor was getting restive, and the
                    government didn't really know what to do about it. Some of the Peronista leaders
                    looked as if they were getting awfully big. The Argentine military were scared
                    to death that, somehow or other, the Peronistas could come back in. That's why
                    they staged the coup. Anyhow, the Political Section was well plugged into what
                    was happening. The coup came along, and was no surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem for the Embassy to have any
                        connections with the Peronistas? Sometimes, we get in a position where you
                        can't talk to So-and-So or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I don't recall any restrictions on our ability to do our job. We weren't
                    harassed or pushed in any way. This may have happened later, after I left,
                    during a sort of civil war (the “dirty war”) which took place over a period of
                    several years in the 1970s. But not while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that in the Political Section, as you watched
                        this democratically elected government getting weaker and weaker and more
                        and more unpopular, you thought that it was very obvious that the military
                        would probably do something at some point. Were our military attach�s
                        keeping tabs on things or were they able to do much about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Let me put it this way. Yes, our military attach�s were doing a good job.
                    Could they have changed history? No. You can know what's going on without being
                    able to do anything about it. That was essentially the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>In fact, at least one or two months before the coup, Ambassador Martin warned the
                    Argentines that the United States would react very badly to a coup because we
                    were (and are) committed to democratic constitutional processes. He also
                    instructed our Defense Attach�s and our Military Assistance Advisory Group
                    (MAAG) in detail on what to say and what not to say in order to try to
                    discourage a coup and, at the very least, give any plotters no reason to hope
                    for US “understanding.” Our military followed Martin's instructions with
                    absolute loyalty and discipline. In that sense, discipline and behavior of
                    different US agency elements at the Embassy in Buenos Aires were far superior to
                    those I observed in Honduras in 1963 while I was desk officer.</p>
                <p>There was another problem, however, which flowed from that coup, because coups
                    were unpopular in the United States, even though the one in Buenos Aires was
                    relatively soft and popular down there. The coup had no anti-Semitic overtones,
                    for example. That was one of our permanent concerns, because there was a large
                    Jewish population in Buenos Aires which was extremely well-connected with our
                    own, New York Jewish community.</p>
                <p>What happened was that there arose in Washington a feeling that “we have to
                    retaliate.” But how can you punish them for having a coup? Well, who carried out
                    the coup? The military. So some people said, “We know, we will 'fix' military
                    aid. There won't be any.” This attitude was reinforced by attitudes in the US
                    Congress. So we began to receive messages that, in effect, delayed the delivery
                    of some promised equipment—some tanks and aircraft. Then we were informed that,
                    perhaps, we should just tear up the contract. The difficulty with that policy
                    was that, within the Argentine armed forces, there were competing attitudes.
                    There was the traditional leadership which had gone through World War II with at
                    least an open and relatively warm attitude toward the Fascists of Italy and the
                    Nazis of Germany. There was a post-war officer generation that, because there
                    was no other foreign power active on the ground with Argentina's military, had
                    become relatively close to United States representatives. Attitudes of the
                    post-war generation often clashed with those of the World War II generation. By
                    cutting off military aid, we cut the legs from under the pro-American
                    faction.</p>
                <p>We did one more thing. We prejudiced the context in which we would later go to
                    the Argentine Government and ask them not to buy a heavy water moderated nuclear
                    reactor for their nuclear research station at Bariloche. They bought a heavy
                    water reactor from the Canadians. The heavy water reactor gave them the ability
                    to produce some of their own, highly enriched, nuclear material. This was
                    ostensibly for research, but, once the system is set up and it works long
                    enough, you'll get enough nuclear material for an explosive device.</p>

                <p>I personally remain convinced that we should have admonished them or attempted to
                    place some additional strings on the next flow of military equipment, but we
                    shouldn't have cut it off altogether. Then, maybe, we would have had a
                    constituency within the Argentine military which would have said, “Look, we are
                    really never going to have an atomic war in South America. We don't need atomic
                    weapons. Let's go for the 'light water' reactor. We can do our research with
                    it.” However, the Argentine military people who might have helped us on that
                    score were destroyed by the cutoff of military aid. They were destroyed in the
                    sense of losing their influence. They remained in the Army, of course.</p>
                <p>There was no other good, alternative non-communist source of equipment at the
                    time, except France — and, eventually, they bought French Mirage aircraft when
                    we refused to sell them more A-4 attack aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a relatively junior officer in the Political
                        Section at the Embassy in Buenos Aires at this time. This was happening.
                        From your vantage point, what was the Political Section or the Ambassador
                        trying to do? Did we go along with this cut-off of military aid? Or was
                        there a fight about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The political section argued for the position I just advocated, and the
                    Ambassador sent our paper to the Department of State in Washington. I'm not sure
                    how much Ambassador Ed Martin really believed it, but he sent it to Washington
                    because, at least, it was a rationale that had some reasonable basis in the
                    situation as we knew it. When Washington said, “No way,” the Embassy, the
                    Ambassador, did not fight Washington very hard. I personally am convinced that
                    Ambassador Ed Martin thought that our political analysis might have been right,
                    but his personal convictions, his utter opposition to coups, his total support
                    for democracy and for minorities just outweighed the downstream risk on the
                    military side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the coup took place. What would a Political Officer do
                        during a coup—just to give an idea to people who read this interview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The first thing you do is to make sure that all American citizens are
                    safe. The second thing is to test to see if there is any violence, so that you
                    know where to keep people away from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you test for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You telephone around the city to see where military units are stationed
                    and what they're doing and how ordinary people on the street are behaving. Is
                    there a curfew? You use your warden network.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The next thing that you do is to put out some feelers, so that you can talk
                    informally with the new the new authorities, but without doing anything that
                    would imply formal recognition by the United States Government. Technically the
                    new authorities may not yet be a government. How do you do all that? You use a
                    very low-level person in the Embassy who talks with a very low-level person who
                    somehow is going to have to respond to the new authorities but is not part of
                    that group. You don't exchange any written communications with the new
                    government. While all of these steps are being taken, you communicate hourly, or
                    more often, with Washington (and with neighboring US Embassies and the US
                    military theater commander for the region, to make sure that all responsible US
                    authorities have some feel for the situation.</p>
                <p>In those days we regarded every recognition of a new government as a kind of
                    blessing, and we let the public know that it was a kind of blessing. That
                    stretched out the period of awkward communications excessively. Thank goodness,
                    we've gotten away from that over the years because too many governments change
                    in unconstitutional fashion, and you have to speak with the new authorities if
                    only to protect Americans. One of the ways you talk with a government, when it's
                    necessary to protect Americans, is to do it through your consular officers,
                    rather than through your diplomatic officers. In any case, it took the
                    Department a while to decide whether formally to recognize the new Argentine
                    government.</p>
                <p>When we do decide to recognize, normally we do it by acknowledging a
                    communication from the new government. Typically the first thing that happens
                    when there has been a coup, is that the newly installed authorities tell the
                    newly installed Foreign Minister to send a note to all resident diplomatic
                    representatives, telling them who is in charge. [Laughter] Then, at some stage,
                    you respond to that note. By responding you acknowledge that the authors of the
                    note are, indeed, in charge. The substance of the note may not be very
                    significant. The text of our note may state simply that we have received the
                    Foreign Minister's note number so-and-so and not much else. The fact that we
                    have responded in a formal way is what constitutes recognition. This is not a
                    kind of blessing. It is merely recognition that the new authorities are in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your particular beat, where would you go, and what type
                        of people did you talk to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: My beat at the time consisted of fringe parties, terrorists, and other
                    bad actors, none of them remotely related to what was happening. So I was mostly
                    inside the Embassy writing reports based on what other people were phoning in
                    regarding the political situation. One of my functions was to work closely with
                    the Labor Attach�, because he would come in with all kinds of information. But
                    he would have a terrible time writing it up. I would help him to put it into
                    something that would be read in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The Political Officer who had all of the connections with the Argentine Congress
                    and other political groups was outside. He would phone in to the Embassy as
                    necessary. The Labor Attach� was outside and phoning in. The officer who was
                    concerned with the more mainstream religious groups — the Jewish community and
                    some of the Protestant groups — was also out of the office. I was in the office,
                    taking phone calls and writing reports on what they told me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that Argentina's probably different from some of
                        the other Latin American countries. In some places, and not only Latin
                        America, Embassy officers tend to get trapped in the ruling elite. You know,
                        the wealthy and the top 20 families in the country or something like that.
                        Was this at all a problem in Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, I don't think so. We obviously dealt with the power brokers,
                    including those who wielded economic, military, and political power. This
                    particular Argentine coup was a classic, Latin American coup. It involved
                    changing chairs among power brokers. It wasn't a revolution. It was a coup.
                    There's a huge difference. We were never out of touch, either with the people in
                    office or the ones likely to enter office. We were able to function without any
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>When a revolution may be coming, the opposition is clandestine, and it may be
                    dangerous to see them in some ways. Then you can be caught off base,
                    particularly if the Embassy is short-handed. However, we weren't short-handed,
                    and it wasn't that kind of situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the problems of the democratically-elected
                        Argentine government? Were they just not able to deliver goods and services
                        or the equivalent thereof?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You know, the situation started to go downhill almost immediately after
                    my arrival in August, 1965. I remember tracking the decline in popularity of the
                    elected government. I remember the growing concern on the part of the Argentine
                    military that, somehow or other, the labor movement would get out of control,
                    and the Peronistas the supporters of former dictator Juan Peron might be
                    restored to power. Eventually, that did happen in the 1970's, but not then.
                    However, I just don't remember that period in that much detail to be able to say
                    precisely what the government was doing, or not doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, the government wasn't very ept.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It wasn't handling that problem at all well, no. You know, there were
                    problems with foreign exchange. There were “meatless” days.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meatless days in Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. You should laugh. “Meatless” meant beefless, except in many
                    restaurants. Meatless did not really mean meatless. You could go into a
                    restaurant and have pork, goat, chicken, hare, venison — you name it. You could
                    have virtually anything except beef. In some restaurants dedicated to the
                    tourist trade, you could get beef anyhow. However, the days without beef were a
                    major aggravation for the Argentine people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. You have the “pampas” [prairies] out there.
                        What happened? Did the cattle go away and move to Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, the problem was that the foreign exchange rates were controlled. In a
                    sense the price of beef to the outside world was a little too high to interest
                    foreign buyers, whereas the price of beef within Argentina was artificially low.
                    The Argentines were eating all of their beef, instead of exporting it. Beef had
                    been one of the two mainstays of their foreign exchange earnings. They were
                    running short of foreign exchange. This meant that they couldn't import
                    industrial goods that they had to have for the economy. So the government
                    imposed beefless days in an effort to get meat packers to lower prices to
                    foreign buyers in order to get rid of excess supplies. At least that was the
                    theory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Argentina about three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We were there for three years, 1965-1968. We were there during the 1967
                    Arab-Israel War. Argentina sat in the UN Security Council at the time. That was
                    the Six Day War, so it was over reasonably fast. When it broke out, the UN
                    Security Council went into permanent session, and so did the governments of
                    every one of the Security Council members.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Buenos Aires is about two hours ahead of New York. Toward the end of the
                    afternoon [New York time] — 7:00 or 8:00 PM Buenos Aires time — our UN Mission
                    (USUN) would start pumping out messages. The Department of State would then
                    instruct USUN and our Embassies in all the countries on the Security Council,
                    saying, “Yes. Do this, do that. It looks reasonable. You may confirm it.” We
                    would start to receive those State Department messages around 8:00 or 9:00 PM.
                    Well, the Argentines have a strong, Spanish heritage, so their Foreign Ministry
                    would typically work until 7:30 or 8:00 PM, sometimes later. So I would find
                    myself trotting over to the Foreign Ministry with the latest message on what we
                    thought the UN Security Council should do next. The Political Director of the
                    Argentine Foreign Ministry, roughly the equivalent of our Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs, would say, “Right.” Then he would go to the Foreign Minister
                    or the Deputy Foreign Minister. They, in turn, might well consult the President
                    of Argentina and the Argentine military. So about 11:30 PM or midnight I would
                    finally get a phone call and be invited back to the Foreign Ministry to get the
                    Argentine answer to what I had presented earlier. Then I would go back to our
                    Embassy and put the Argentine reply on the wire to USUN [US Mission to the
                    United Nations] and the Department of State. I would get home around 2:30 or
                    3:00 AM and then be back in the office at 8:00 AM. I had a one-hour commute from
                    home to the Embassy. So I was certainly glad when that was over.</p>
                <p>But there also was real exhilaration at being involved in important action and a
                    significant event. You remember things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your adrenalin starts pumping.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You can run on exhilaration and nervous energy for a surprisingly long
                    time, but after a while the body catches up. This process of exhausting nightly
                    communications lasted a week plus a wind down of another three or four days.
                    Then we began to live more normal hours. I could tolerate that, but not if it
                    had gone on for more than a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Argentina's attitude toward this crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Their attitude largely paralleled ours. They wanted the war to stop. They
                    were not particularly pro-Arab or pro-Israeli. They certainly weren't hostile to
                    Israel. For the most part their votes and ours were about the same.</p>
                <p>From an Argentine point of view the only significant element in a Middle East war
                    was what it might do to international oil prices. Argentina depended heavily on
                    imported energy supplies. That was their number one, national concern. So
                    anything that the UN could do to end the war or reduce the risk to a continued
                    flow of oil had their support. That and human rights were their concerns.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Argentina when the military government was in
                        power. What was your impression of how they were operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Let me mention a couple of other things that were important to me during
                    my tour in Buenos Aires. First of all, it was the first time that I had served
                    in an Embassy. It was a fairly large Embassy in a very sophisticated, 20th
                    century, European style city. I learned how an Embassy works, how a Political
                    Section is really supposed to work, and how you divide up the work. What's
                    important, what's less important. How to write. All of these things. I was
                    serving and talking on a daily basis with senior officers in our Embassy who
                    could mentor me. When I had been in Brazil, first as Vice Consul in Recife, and
                    then as Consul in Curitiba, these were relatively isolated posts. The senior
                    officers who were responsible for me were in Rio de Janeiro. They would visit me
                    perhaps once every six months. There would be an annual, consular officers'
                    conference that I would attend. Occasionally, they would suggest to me a subject
                    that they would like to hear about or a gentle critique of one or another of my
                    reports. But there was no daily guidance on how to do my job.</p>
                <p>My wife and I had served in two consular posts, and I think that we did
                    reasonably well. However, we had been learning by trial and error. It was
                    awfully nice to be in the Embassy in Buenos Aires and realize that you didn't
                    have to learn how to do your job by trial and error. I was grateful for that
                    experience. We were glad, too, to have the chance to live in a large,
                    sophisticated city after the small towns [Recife and Curitiba] that we had been
                    in. Service in Buenos Aires gave us a different perspective on what the Foreign
                    Service might offer to us. We certainly exploited everything that Buenos Aires
                    had to offer.</p>
                <p>There was another aspect that astonished me. Despite my year of Latin American
                    area studies at Stanford University, somehow all of the wars in Latin America —
                    the civil wars, the coups, and so on — seemed remote. They belonged to the
                    previous century or maybe to the depression era of the 1930's. After World War
                    II it was inconceivable to me that a couple of Latin American countries could
                    fight each other. The last such struggle had been between Peru and Ecuador, and
                    we and the Brazilians and some other countries had managed to end that in 1942.
                    I was stunned to realize that the unresolved Chilean-Argentine disputes over
                    their land frontier and in the Beagle Channel near the extreme southern tip of
                    South America could produce violence. In fact, there were at least two clashes
                    between Chile and Argentina while I was there. That lesson was valuable because
                    later, when I encountered a war between El Salvador and Honduras, and much later
                    on, within the past 15 years, when I saw shooting between Peru and Ecuador
                    again, I was able to anticipate more accurately both what would trigger conflict
                    and when it would happen.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: I would like to add that many years later there was the
                    Falklands/Malvinas war [1982]. I knew from my experience in Buenos Aires how
                    much the British hold on the Falklands irritated the Argentines. Because
                    Argentina had had several coups since World War II, I knew that it was always
                    possible that some extremist would get his hands on a lever and launch an attack
                    on the Falklands. I'm afraid that my British colleagues didn't understand that
                    that was possible. The British always stonewalled the Argentines on the
                    Falklands, primarily because they didn't know how to handle the Scottish
                    constituencies in Westminster who demanded that the British Government keep some
                    1,800 people there, raising their sheep in the South Atlantic.</p>
                <p>After the 1982 war, when they added up the bill, the British realized that it
                    would have been a lot cheaper to have given every Falkland Islander — man,
                    woman, and child — something more than $100,000 each, for them to use as they
                    wished — to resettle wherever they wanted, or to stay in the Falklands if they
                    were willing to live under the Argentine flag. And that's just the money side of
                    the cost to Britain. It takes no account of the lives lost. And, although the
                    British do not acknowledge it, the balance of legal argument over which country
                    — Argentina or the United Kingdom — has the stronger claim to the
                    Falklands/Malvinas is unclear. So any assertion that “principle” gave the
                    British no alternative to military action is on thin ice, especially in view of
                    their long-standing refusal to arbitrate, adjudicate or negotiate a
                    settlement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were going through a vast, social change in the United
                        States at this time, particularly as far as racial relations are concerned.
                        Argentina essentially had gotten rid of its Indian population and didn't
                        seem to have the same problem and understanding. Was this something you got
                        involved in—trying to explain to the Argentines what we were doing, or was
                        there any interest at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There was really very little interest. So an American city burns and
                    downtown Washington, DC has problems. Or Los Angeles has its problems and there
                    were riots and fires in New Jersey and elsewhere. That would appear in the
                    Argentine newspapers. People would frown and cluck over it — much the way
                    Americans cluck over violence in Nagorno Kabakh. It may be exciting, but we're
                    not really involved in it. People don't really spend a lot of emotional energy
                    on it. Well, the Argentines didn't spend a lot of emotional energy on our
                    problems, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, the United States did not have the same connotation
                        for the Argentines that we would have for the Mexicans or some other
                        countries. I mean, the idea of “The Colossus of the North.” The United
                        States was far away, and it was just a benign country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, the Argentines had long perceived the United States as a rival for
                    prestige and hemispheric leadership. Most Americans don't understand that in
                    1900, if you look at all of the indicators of relative development, Argentina
                    was at least as developed a country as was the United States. Measured in per
                    capita steel production, energy output, miles of railroad and paved road per
                    square mile of territory, the extent of the public education system and levels
                    of literacy, in all of those indicators Argentina was equal to or better than
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>Then, after World War I and really starting with the depression of the 1930's
                    everything came apart in Argentina. Juan Domingo Peron arrived in a key position
                    in 1942 and really showed labor how to organize and how to be a political force.
                    He rode that force to the top. His political movement had a sort of fascistic,
                    populist and ant-market-economy ethic. It ruined the country. There is no other
                    way to say it. The Argentines really threw away the whole thing. In 1947 they
                    paid Great Britain $600 million in gold for the British-owned railroads of
                    Argentina. These railroads had been run into the ground, not maintained, and
                    were so rickety that they were virtually worthless. That was a terrible error.
                    It was good for Britain and may have saved Britain, economically, because
                    Britain was really on its uppers in 1947, following World War II. So I think
                    that the United States was glad that Britain got that $600 million infusion.
                    That was a lot of money in those days. But it made a mess of Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was done for reasons of national prestige.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Done partly for quasi-ideological reasons. One of the fascist and
                    socialistic theses was that the government should own the means of
                    communications and transportation. Until 1947 the railroads of Argentina were
                    largely privately owned by British firms.</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that Argentina's principal foreign exchange earners were beef
                    and wheat. Beef had traditionally been exported to Britain and to continental
                    Europe, but Britain was one of the single most important markets and the
                    traditional source of most of Argentina's industrial goods.They couldn't afford
                    to alienate Britain. You have to remember that the only sources of industrial
                    goods after World War II were the United States and Britain. The rest of the
                    world was still largely destroyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been flattened by World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>ROWELL: So if you had an economy that was at the outer extremities of its
                    depreciable life, in terms of its physical assets, and you desperately needed
                    spare parts and replacement machinery, then the only place that you could get
                    these things was the US or Britain. If Argentina had simply nationalized the
                    British-owned railroads without paying for them, you could expect a severe
                    reaction from the United States, whose private investors owned lots of things in
                    Argentina, and certainly from Britain. So we and Britain had considerable
                    leverage with our industrial economies. The Argentines then concluded that if
                    they were going to take over the railroads, they would have to buy them. And
                    they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, of course, we're talking about 1947. From 1939 really
                        until 1947 virtually all productive activity in Britain and the United
                        States was directed toward war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Were there any other events and incidents during this time that you were in
                    Argentina?</p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. There was a really funny event. After I had been in Argentina for a
                    year, I assumed responsibility for covering political events in some of the
                    northern and western Argentine provinces. So I started off on my first
                    provincial trip to call on governors, business leaders and others just to take
                    the pulse of people outside of Buenos Aires. The views of the provinces
                    throughout Argentina's history had always differed sharply from the views of
                    people in Buenos Aires.</p>
                <p>On the Argentine railroads you could get a ticket for a berth, but you normally
                    didn't take a whole compartment. When I went to take this trip, the only
                    unoccupied berth on the train, on this relatively long trip, was in a
                    compartment of four berths. So I climbed into the railroad car.</p>
                <p>The other berths were occupied by traveling salesmen. We talked. They learned who
                    I was, and I knew who they were. About 10:00 PM they started a card game. I was
                    tired, but they were talking and smoking. They were beginning to run low on wine
                    but still enjoying the card game. Well, I happened to have a couple of bottles
                    of wine in my bag, so I took out a bottle and gave it to them. They invited me
                    to sit at the table. I said that I didn't want to play cards. They said, “That's
                    all right. Just sit and talk with us.” So we talked. As the train rolled along
                    the track to C�rdoba in the middle of the night, they would look out the window
                    and say, “Oh, this is Fulgencio,” or Diego, or whatever it was. They would give
                    the names of these stations and the “estancias,” or large ranches, and then the
                    towns. They said, “You know, this ranch owner has this and this, and he's
                    married to so-and-so, but his wife is having an affair with” somebody else. They
                    knew this important person and that important person, and the mayor in this town
                    had done this and that, and they've gone broke, so we don't stop and sell
                    machinery there this year.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>By the time I got off the train in Cordoba at 9:30 AM the next day I was
                    cross-eyed, because I hadn't been to bed and hadn't slept. And I knew everything
                    that was going on in the territory between Buenos Aires and Cordoba. I really
                    didn't have to call on a soul. Well, I did call on the senior provincial
                    officials — the governor, the mayors of the big cities, and so on. However, ever
                    since then I have respected the role of the traveling salesman. Years later,
                    when I was in Bolivia, that warm spot in my heart for traveling salesmen paid
                    off in a big way for AID [Agency for International Development].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Buenos Aires in 1968...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: On a direct transfer to Honduras as Political Officer in the Embassy in
                    Tegucigalpa. The Embassy had a Political Officer, a junior officer-trainee, and
                    a Labor Attach�. Bob White was pulled out of Tegucigalpa to head up the Latin
                    American Division of the Peace Corps. Because I had been Honduras desk officer,
                    I was presumed to know everything that was going on and to need no start- up
                    time, and the Embassy needed somebody right away. So you can see still today the
                    figurative furrows of my fingernails scraped across the Andes Mountains as the
                    Department dragged me back to Honduras, after I had lived the sybaritic life of
                    Buenos Aires. My tour in Argentina had been cut short by a year.</p>
                <p>Honduras was a very different experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Honduras from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: From August, 1968, to July, 1970. Honduras was underdeveloped. Many of
                    the streets were unpaved. There was a latent hostility toward “gringos” and
                    “yanquis” that I had never sensed, either in Argentina or in Brazil. It was
                    palpable. Honduras was still a place where American freebooters roamed. One or
                    two of them were on the government payroll. The others were there on their own
                    hook.</p>
                <p>What's a freebooter? An adventurer out after self-made fortune. There was a man
                    named Frank Turner living on the north, or Caribbean, coast of Honduras. In 1968
                    he was 76 years old. He had fled to Honduras in the 1920's. He always wore a
                    gun. He was known as the fastest gun in Honduras and allegedly once had been the
                    fastest gun in Texas. Warrants for his arrest had been outstanding in Honduras
                    for over 30 years. He was finally arrested, in an outhouse, literally caught
                    with his pants down in 1968. They put him in jail, and our Consul went down to
                    help him. At age 76 he couldn't stand living in a pestilential jail. He died six
                    weeks later.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I'll give you another example. An American had migrated to the northeast cost of
                    Honduras to set himself up in the frozen shrimp business. He planned to export
                    to the US. He had the freezing and packaging equipment, but no boats. Instead he
                    had expected to buy shrimp from local trawlers. That wasn't working. Not enough
                    shrimp were coming in. So he bought some sophisticated radio equipment that let
                    him track the whereabouts of the Jacksonville, Florida shrimpers that trawled
                    that part of the Caribbean. And he made a deal with an Army lieutenant in
                    Trujillo. The American would tell the lieutenant when the Jacksonville boats
                    were trawling in Honduran waters. The lieutenant would seize the trawlers. And
                    he and the American would split the profits from the shrimp seized from the
                    Jacksonville boats. It worked. The lieutenant commandeered an old rust bucket,
                    put about 18 soldiers with rifles around its railings, and steamed to the entry
                    of an area surrounded by coral islets that at low tide were just barely above
                    water (and therefore constituted Honduran territory). He caught the trawlers
                    maintaining gear. Several got away, but several more were brought into Trujillo
                    where some of the crewmen had to stay in a local bordello because the jail
                    wasn't big enough and the lieutenant didn't want to risk leaving them on the
                    boats. Our consul was very busy freeing the boats from the government and the
                    crews from the bordello. We in Tegucigalpa were busy answering phone calls from
                    frantic family members in Florida. And the American freezer operator — in many
                    ways a classic freebooter — managed to keep his business going.</p>
                <p>As you can see, Honduras was very colorful. We arrived in Tegucigalpa and
                    initially stayed in the Lincoln Hotel. I went down to the O. Henry Bar and
                    reread his story, “Cabbages and Kings.” Every word is true.</p>
                <p>I think that I described earlier how we supported the labor unions there. That
                    really saved much of the banana companies' interests. This project was still
                    going on, and we still had to watch it in 1968.</p>
                <p>We had Peace Corps Volunteers living in different parts of the country. One of my
                    jobs was to prepare the volunteers to deal effectively with the political
                    environment in remote rural areas. I told them they might well find a figure in
                    some remote valley called “Colonel.” They should understand that that man had
                    absolute life and death authority in that valley. It might not have been
                    constitutional authority, but it was authority in a very pragmatic and real way.
                    Moreover, communications with Tegucigalpa were weak, slow and erratic. The
                    volunteers had to understand that if they made changes, they had to do them in a
                    way that would not risk their own lives or their Honduran project partners after
                    their departure.</p>
                <p>Briefing the volunteers was challenging because we were already working up toward
                    the Kent State event in Ohio in 1970.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: Against the war in Vietnam. These Peace Corps Volunteers were fresh from
                    US universities. They didn't trust anybody in a position of authority. They
                    intend to trust me, the First Secretary in the Political Section of the American
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>The Peace Corps Director in the country — still a very good friend of mine —
                    devised a way to get over these mental blocks. His job, of course, was to enable
                    his Peace Corps Volunteers to do a good job, to get home safely, and to leave
                    behind some kind of enduring legacy. To do that, they had to understand the
                    environment they were swimming in. Their understanding had to start with what
                    the Embassy had to tell them.</p>
                <p>The volunteers would arrive in Honduras, they would have two weeks of briefings,
                    and I would give my spiel. They would be recalled from where they were living
                    and working at the end of 90 days. I would again talk with them and tell them
                    what I saw as going on in the country. I would ask them, “What part of what I
                    told you before was valid and what part wasn't valid, because I don't want to
                    tell people things that aren't true.” They would say, “Well, at first we were
                    skeptical about what you were telling us. However, we decided that we would be
                    'cautious' just in case you were right.” Then they said, “We think that you may
                    be right.” At the end of another 180 days they'd come back for another
                    conference and would say, “We know you were right.” [Laughter] Then they
                    wouldn't return to the capital until it was time to leave the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a particular, generational attitude in
                        the United States, where the watchword was, “Don't trust anybody over 30.”
                        This was coming out of the best universities in the United States. And the
                        best and brightest were coming out of these universities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: And I was already 37.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God! So it was a real problem. It was not just
                        brain washing, but it was sort of how to protect yourself. There were these
                        youngsters coming out of universities, and we had that responsibility. It
                        sounds as if you handled this well. What was your impression of the Peace
                        Corps and the efforts they were making?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>ROWELL: They were trying very hard to help people living in isolated, rural areas
                    to find a way to have a slightly better life. Maybe to be more productive on
                    their farms and with the chickens that they were raising or to cooperate more
                    effectively on community projects such as building little water retention dams
                    to protect themselves from the summer drought. Maybe to build community social
                    centers to which some sewing machines could be given, so that when they had to
                    make clothes, they had a sewing machine available that would work, where those
                    who knew how to sew better could teach the others. The community center could
                    then be a place where the children could start to learn to read. These were very
                    simple kinds of things. In a couple of the better off valleys the Peace Corps
                    Volunteers started cooperatives, so that ordinary farmers, living up on the
                    sides of the hills, could obtain seed or fertilizer at a lower price than they
                    had been paying at the main feed store, which was probably owned by the
                    colonel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, this type of thing can be breaking rice
                        bowls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's an oriental term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Local rice bowls. At the same time you've got to deal with
                        and live with the colonel and all of that. How did this work out? Was it
                        left to them to....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was really left to the Peace Corps Volunteers to deal with it. We in
                    the Embassy didn't have anybody out in those valleys. All that we said was,
                    “Look, whatever you do, try to arrange it so that the local Hondurans with whom
                    you have worked most closely are somehow or other 'insulated' from the negative
                    aspects. That is, 'negative' for the valley hierarchy in terms of what you're
                    doing, so that they have a chance to survive your departure.” There were a
                    couple of instances in which these Hondurans didn't survive. They just
                    disappeared after the Peace Corps Volunteer had gone. The local hierarchy never
                    interfered while the American Peace Corps Volunteer was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>In other valleys, particularly where the population was a little bit larger, so
                    that there was a body of people who provided mutual protection, in a political
                    sense, these things caught on and did some good. I used to go out and visit the
                    Peace Corps Volunteers from time to time. That could be quite exciting. AID had
                    a lease agreement for a couple of small, twin engine airplanes. When an AID
                    officer was traveling, very often the Peace Corps Director and I would hitch a
                    ride, because it was often the only way that we could get to some of the remote
                    villages. The landing strip would be on a little, narrow shelf on the face of a
                    cliff. Honduras is a very mountainous country, with peaks running around 10,000
                    feet. You would be flying in valleys with sheer walls on either side. Then there
                    would be a landing strip half way up one wall — full of rabbit holes or
                    something like that. The plane would come in, bounce a bit, and then come to a
                    halt. You get out with your teeth still chattering, you do your business, and
                    wish that there were some way other than the airplane to get out of the
                    mountains. Then you would screw up your courage, climb back in, and pray.</p>
                <p>One day we were flying between walls of rock. We went around a dog leg in the
                    valley, and there was a solid wall of fog in front of us and above us. The pilot
                    stood the airplane on its wingtip, flew as close as he could to one wall, did a
                    180 degree turn, barely missing the other wall, and we got back to Tegucigalpa.
                    I was scared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Honduras in the
                        1968-1970 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The military had always been an important force. There was a small
                    oligarchy which was really running the country. There was a traditional party in
                    power, the National Party [Partido Nacional de Honduras — PNH]. There was an
                    opposition party — I think that they were called the Colorados [Reds], or
                    perhaps Liberales. I'm not sure which. The leader of the opposition party had
                    spent many years in exile. He was called Ramon Villeda Morales. His nickname was
                    “El Pajarito,” The Little Bird. Periodically, you would hear that the Little
                    Bird had flown in from Texas, or something like that. The principal leader of
                    the opposition party was Carlos Roberto Reina, who today is President of
                    Honduras. I met with him often at his home and in his office.There were
                    elections, but the National Party managed to stay in charge. In any case, the
                    opposition party could complain, and did so from time to time. They were allowed
                    to pass some of their laws, but they remained in the opposition. The communists
                    were sometimes noisy, but not terribly effective.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>We had an AID project to try to develop Honduran forestry. Honduras had hundreds
                    of thousands of hectares of virgin pine forest of very good quality. The wood
                    was literally going to waste. The trees were aging and, because of their age,
                    becoming weak and prone to infection from fungus and other parasites. The
                    forests needed to be logged. To do that in an effective way, and this was one of
                    the really big potential investments in Honduras, a paper industry needed to be
                    established which would produce cardboard and even good quality printing paper
                    and that sort of thing. But that would be a big investment, and so a paper
                    company would have had to have certain guarantees regarding the source of lumber
                    and construction of a certain road infrastructure. That meant providing a center
                    where people would collect in communities that didn't yet exist. And that, in
                    turn, meant establishing new centers of political power which the existing
                    oligarchy really didn't want, because they had a good handle on what they had
                    and they didn't need new urban centers springing up around the country that
                    could challenge them. So somehow the necessary laws to permit the development
                    would never pass. It was amazing how many times, at the last minute, the
                    communist bench would rise and harangue the Congress. There would be a
                    demonstration in favor of the communist view that you couldn't give away the
                    national patrimony. And the hands of the governing party would be tied.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the communists weren't part of the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It's interesting to see how well they were used. No American would
                    believe that the communists could be used, but they were used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our Ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: When I arrived, it was John Jova, who later was the Ambassador to the
                    Organization of American States [OAS] and to Mexico. After he retired, he headed
                    Meridian House in Washington. Hew Ryan followed John Jova. Hewson A. Ryan was a
                    USIA [United States Information Agency] officer. When he left Honduras and
                    retired, he went up to the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
                    University, where he taught for a number of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was interviewed in this Oral History early on. How
                        did John Jova operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: John Jova was well plugged in to the Honduran hierarchy. He knew how to
                    go horseback riding with people who enjoyed horseback riding. He would go out
                    with them on hunts. He was very comfortable in their social milieu. So he always
                    had lots of information about what was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>As the Political Officer, I tended to more time covering the opposition because
                    Ambassador Jova was so well plugged in with the establishment. That was a
                    reasonable division of responsibility. The Labor Attach� handled the labor
                    unions and the banana companies. The junior Political Officer was basically
                    learning the trade. He skimmed the publications, perhaps followed the Congress
                    when it was in open session, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Honduras during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Our primary interest was to prevent the communists from taking over
                    anything, whether it was labor or getting a serious leg up in Congress. Another
                    interest was to protect American investments, which meant primarily the fruit
                    companies, but it also included some gold and other minerals producing
                    companies. Another interest was to encourage a market-centered economic
                    development process in Central America. AID had a Regional Development Office,
                    based in Guatemala. Encouraging development meant trying to promote the Central
                    American Common Market. This never really worked very well because the countries
                    concerned weren't willing to sacrifice elements of their own development in a
                    given sector so that sector could become large enough to compete on a world
                    scale.</p>
                <p>Development also involved things like education and health programs. Malaria has
                    always been a problem in Central America. Another major interest was to keep the
                    area peaceful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, because Cuba was supporting the Communist Party of Honduras. As I
                    said before, our top priority was to keep the communists from getting a leg up.
                    We watched the Cubans and we watched the communists. We tried to help the
                    Hondurans to interdict communications between Cuba and the Honduran communists.
                    I don't think that they were interdicted very effectively. However, the Honduran
                    communists were not a terribly well organized party, and no number of visitors
                    from Cuba could make them change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 3, Side A, of the interview with Ambassador
                        Ed Rowell. I asked this same question when we were discussing your time in
                        Argentina. I would think that it would be easier for the Embassy in Honduras
                        to be absorbed by the ruling elite. They are important. It's not necessarily
                        because they have a lot of money, but they also are the movers and shakers.
                        Sometimes you can get too cozy with them. Was this a problem or did you see
                        it as such at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>ROWELL: No, I don't think that that was a problem in Honduras. We had a very open
                    relationship with the governing authorities, but our relationship with the
                    opposition party and my personal relationship with Carlos Roberto Reina, were
                    very close. Moreover, my predecessor, Bob White, had done outstanding work with
                    the opposition. When I arrived, I didn't have to create these relationships.
                    They were sitting there, waiting for me to walk into them, and I kept them
                    going. Again, we weren't shackled in our dealings with anybody. None of us in
                    the Embassy was harassed, nothing happened, there were no warnings—nothing like
                    that. There really weren't any problems in that regard.</p>
                <p>The major event of my stay there in Honduras was the war between Honduras and El
                    Salvador. This was the so-called soccer war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what the soccer war was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There had always been frictions between El Salvador and Honduras,
                    stemming in part from the constant movement into Honduran territory, which was
                    largely unoccupied, of economic refugees from El Salvador. El Salvador was
                    over-populated, and its lands were controlled by an oligarchy that dedicated
                    them to the coffee industry. But there were other jealousies and frictions.</p>
                <p>When this war started, a soccer series was going on between Honduras and El
                    Salvador. The middle game of the series was played in El Salvador. Rumors had
                    circulated that somehow the Salvadoran team had been harassed when they visited
                    Honduras. When the Honduran soccer fans went to El Salvador, people along the
                    side of the highway in El Salvador fired shotguns and rifles through the busses
                    carrying the soccer visitors. Then there was a big riot at the stadium in El
                    Salvador. Somehow, the Hondurans got back home. When word of the violence in El
                    Salvador spread, there was a riot in Honduras. A lot of Salvadorans lived in
                    Honduras, many of them shopowners. Their shops were ransacked, and they were
                    frightened and scared. The next thing we knew, the Salvadoran government had
                    launched a war against Honduras “to protect its citizens in Honduras.” To this
                    day I don't know what or who really triggered all of that violence.</p>
                <p>I had lived in Argentina and understood that simmering border issues can produce
                    war, so I wasn't completely surprised by the violence. However, it was the kind
                    of thing that I would not have predicted. You can never predict when a mob is
                    going to form and get out of control. You really can't. Since we have so many
                    events like soccer matches, where people collect in numbers large enough to
                    create a critical mass, you can be caught by surprise. That happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I had been scheduled for home leave. I needed the leave. I'd had dysentery, my
                    mother was sick in a hospital, and there were a lot of family problems. The
                    riots started on a Monday, and we reported them. By the end of the week things
                    had quieted down, and it looked as if things might be all right. The DCM, who at
                    the time was Charg� d'Affaires, gave me permission to go ahead and start my home
                    leave. Ambassador Jova was leaving at the end of that week. I got to Washington,
                    but 24 hours later I was summoned to the State Department and told to go back to
                    Honduras, as the situation was getting testier. So my family was left stranded
                    in the US, and I was back in Honduras. We had rented our house to an American
                    businessman for the two months of home leave. He didn't have any other place to
                    go, so he told me to find some other place to live. He let me come in and get
                    some clothes out of a closet. The PAO [Public Affairs Officer] let me share his
                    house.</p>
                <p>Then, for four weeks the situation got worse and worse. At the end of the fourth
                    week a Salvadoran DC-3 (C-47) aircraft, with a hole literally cut in its belly,
                    flew over the Honduran airport in Tegucigalpa and attempted to bomb it. Each of
                    the six 100-pound bombs missed the airport, but one of them hit the dining room
                    in the home of one of our senior AID employees. The next day, when the
                    Salvadorans tried a second bombing, .50 caliber machine gun bullets hit the
                    American School. There was more, collateral damage at the home of an American
                    Government employee. Then panicky reports started coming in. The Hondurans
                    called us in and asked for US Marines to protect them from the invading
                    Salvadorans. They had a report from the colonel in charge of their Western
                    Battalion, which was the front where the invasion had taken place, saying that
                    he had lost 700 troops. A long time later we discovered that he had never had
                    700 troops. He had some, none of them militarily trained, but not 700. He had
                    been pocketing the money the Honduran Government had been sending him to pay for
                    their salaries, rations and quarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a handy way to make up the balance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: So the Honduran Army was sitting there with machetes and old rifles,
                    facing the Salvadorans, who were coming in with Belgian made automatic weapons.
                    The Salvadorans also had armored vehicles in the form of jeeps with one-quarter
                    inch steel plates welded onto them. So there was an armored assault across the
                    Honduran frontier which was “defended” by troops with machetes and hunting
                    rifles.</p>
                <p>The Salvadoran Army at the time was not terribly well disciplined. The automatic
                    weapons were a disaster in the hands of undisciplined or untrained soldiers.
                    They exhausted their ammunition in the first 15 minutes of the war. They simply
                    put their weapons on full automatic when they crossed the Honduran border and
                    fired at anything they saw, and there wasn't much there. The invasion slowed
                    immediately because the Salvadoran soldiers were on their own — with machete
                    against machete. That's a different sort of conflict.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The air war was more interesting. The Honduran Air Force had long been the best
                    in Central America in terms of aircraft maintenance. They were flying F4U
                    Corsairs, US built carrier airplanes from World War II. They were superbly well
                    maintained. The Hondurans had their own shops where they made their own spare
                    parts. The Salvadorans were flying P-51 Mustangs and some F4U's. The Honduran
                    Air Force lost one airplane due to fuel exhaustion. It ran out of gas before
                    coming back. The Salvadoran Air Force had several planes shot down. After the
                    first two days the Salvadoran Air Force did not attack Honduras again. The
                    Hondurans put the Exxon oil refinery at Acajutla, El Salvador, out of business
                    for 18 months.</p>
                <p>Forty-eight hours before the war started I sensed that if it was going to happen,
                    it would come that weekend. Don't ask me how I knew it. It was just something in
                    my bones. I could see the arguments going back and forth in the traffic between
                    our Embassy and the Embassy in San Salvador. The OAS [Organization of American
                    States] was already trying to mediate, but I could see that that wasn't working
                    fast enough. Our military attach�s on both sides of the frontier did outstanding
                    work. By the time Friday of that week came, I said to myself, “There's going to
                    be a war.”</p>
                <p>Against this background I went to the Peace Corps Director and said, “You'd
                    better pull all of the Peace Corps Volunteers out of the frontier region.” So he
                    and one of my colleagues from the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] went out to
                    the frontier area in jeeps Friday afternoon and night and all day Saturday and
                    most of Sunday and told all of the Peace Corps Volunteers to get out of the
                    frontier area. Some of the Volunteers didn't want to get out. They felt that
                    they could take care of themselves. They said that the people were friendly
                    because they didn't understand anything about war. However, most of them came
                    back to Tegucigalpa, the national capital, and we didn't lose any volunteers.
                    The few who stubbornly remained in the frontier region were thoroughly scared.
                    All of them eventually got out and came to Tegucigalpa. There was a lot of
                    shooting in that frontier area, including recoilless rifles, which make a lot of
                    noise. We did get the word to all of them before the shooting started Sunday
                    evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, when the war was going on, what were you
                        doing? What was the Embassy doing? As you said, you have the safety of
                        Americans in mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, and the safety of Americans became a big problem. The Hondurans
                    insisted that the US send in reinforcements to protect them. We refused. We
                    refused to give them ammunition or military supplies to help their side. They
                    were furious at us. We helped to protect some innocent Salvadoran civilians who
                    risked death at the hands of vigilantes. There was a curfew and a blackout. It
                    was a very effective blackout, because they simply turned off the electricity
                    supply to the city. All lights went out. Vigilante groups roaming the streets of
                    Tegucigalpa. If they spotted a candle through a window, they would threaten to
                    chop down the door to put out the candle. They were afraid of more air raids,
                    and said that no light must show.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Every night we would have some Americans calling, saying that the vigilantes were
                    threatening to chop down the doors. You have to understand that we had become
                    horribly unpopular. I remember one night when an American woman out at the edge
                    of Tegucigalpa called. She was alone with her children. The vigilantes were
                    literally chopping at the door. I went out to her house. You couldn't show a
                    light on a vehicle. It was the new moon, and there was no moonlight. Tegucigalpa
                    is a mountainous city. We were driving on mountainous roads in starlight. So
                    what should have been a 10-minute ride took 40 minutes, and I had to pass
                    through four vigilante checkpoints on the way. I reached this woman's house. The
                    vigilantes were sitting outside the house. I don't remember what I told them,
                    but they stopped threatening her. We had two or three calls like that every
                    single night.</p>
                <p>Then we had the Salvadorans who had taken refuge in the basements of churches. We
                    helped the Catholic priests to escort them to safe haven in the basement of a
                    central collecting point. We were driving in diplomatic vehicles, again by
                    starlight. Embassy officers took turns doing that.</p>
                <p>One of the decision problems we had was, “Do the women officers do this?” Well,
                    Betty Friedan writings had appeared in print, but Women's Lib hadn't completed
                    its cycle in the mid-1970's. The military officers were doing a lot of this
                    escort duty, because there were a lot more of them than of us civilians, at that
                    point. They said, “No, women shouldn't do this. We'll do it.” I looked at these
                    guys. They had wives and children at home. I said, “You know, an officer is an
                    officer. You accept a commission and you undertake the responsibilities and
                    risks of the commission.” The women Foreign Service officers were anxious to do
                    it, to prove that they could do their job. I said that they would do it. I drew
                    up the rotation schedules for night escort duty on that basis. Nobody was hurt.
                    The day that you decide that an officer is an officer you have defined the
                    person's roles and responsibilities — the commission, not the gender of its
                    bearer, settles the question. And then you send them out in harm's way. That was
                    a key turning point in my own thinking about women's roles in professional
                    services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved at all in Embassy to Honduran Government
                        connections, trying to get everybody to cool it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Oh, yes, day after day. The OAS came in and brought in a whole bunch of
                    OAS peacekeepers and boundary watchers. It took about two weeks to arrange for a
                    cease-fire, and then another week to get OAS peacekeepers in place, along the
                    frontier. Once they did that, then a long negotiation took place, mostly at OAS
                    headquarters in Washington. Things were still tense, and the Embassy still
                    operated 24 hours a day for a long time. However, the shooting was over, and it
                    was clear that it wasn't going to start again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about United Fruit Company employees and offices
                        during this whole period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>ROWELL: No problem. The fruit company area, the banana growing zone, is up along
                    the Caribbean coast of Honduras. This invasion came at the western end of the
                    country and away from the coast, as well as along the southwestern frontier with
                    El Salvador. This was a long distance from the banana plantation area. So this
                    was not an issue.</p>
                <p>I asked for permission to go back and have some of my home leave, since my mother
                    was in the hospital with a heart problem. The Charg� d'Affaires reluctantly let
                    me go. Finally, I picked up my family in Washington and brought them back to
                    Honduras. We were able to move back into our house.</p>
                <p>From that time on life in Honduras was really very unpleasant. It had been
                    difficult enough during our first year there. The American School had a minority
                    of American students. The American students were harassed by the Honduran
                    students. Their notebooks would be taken, ink would be poured on them, or they
                    would be jostled in the corridors. We had to escort our children around the city
                    for the remainder of our stay in Honduras. There was a stand across the street
                    from our house, where chewing gum, bubble gum, and candy was sold — the kinds of
                    things that kids buy. Our children were used to going there. My wife had to
                    escort them across the street and back. If they played in our yard, we had to
                    have somebody physically in the yard watching them.</p>
                <p>One day my wife was driving downtown. In the rear view mirror she noticed a car
                    with a couple of young men in it. She thought, “I've seen them somewhere.
                    They're probably following me.” So she took a zig zag route through downtown.
                    The car stayed right on her tail, the whole way. She wheeled our car into the
                    gateway leading to a long driveway going into the Italian Embassy. She left the
                    car in the gateway and then ran to the front door of the Embassy. She rang the
                    bell, pushed her way in, and took refuge there. The car that had been following
                    her parked behind her car, stayed there for about 10 minutes, and then drove
                    off. So it was clear that they were following her. I don't think that they meant
                    to harm her. I think that they meant to frighten her. If they had meant to hurt
                    her, they probably would have done so. However, it was a worrisome kind of
                    event. That kind of thing went on and on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Honduran

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Most business went on as it had gone on before. They resented our failure
                    to support them. On the other hand, they didn't lose any territory. They still
                    felt that they had to deal with us and so they did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes when there is a war of any nature, the Embassies

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I would like to think that what the Embassy in San Salvador did and what
                    we in the Embassy in Tegucigalpa was proper, but I'll leave it to the historians
                    to examine the record. I think that we took on the coloration of Honduras far
                    less than the Embassy in San Salvador took on the coloration of El Salvador,
                    though not entirely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our Ambassador at that time in Honduras Ryan or
                        Jova?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We were between Ambassadors and had a Charg� d'Affaires, Jean Wilkowski.
                    The Ambassador in San Salvador was Bill Bowdler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Bowdler was later Assistant Secretary for ARA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. Assistant Secretary for American Republics Affairs. The
                    same Bill Bowdler for whom I worked when I was moved out of Richard Goodwin's
                    Staff Assistant job in 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time did you get any feel for the new regime of
                        President Richard Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger or
                        were you happily suffering from benign neglect? This was early in the Nixon
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. The United States was not terribly interested in Latin
                    America at the time — and even less interested in Central America. The soccer
                    war surprised everybody in Washington. When you have war in your backyard, you
                    pay attention. However, as soon as that was taken care of, people really
                    re-directed their attention to the Soviet front, NATO, the Middle East peace
                    problems, and above all, China and Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: And Vietnam. That absorbed them. One of the good things about working on
                    Latin America is that, for the most part, the senior members of the Foreign
                    Service could conduct policy, because the most senior people in Washington
                    didn't want to spend any time on Latin America.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that you left there with a certain feeling of,
                        “Thank God, that's over.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I felt a lot of relief. We had some good friends there. I have great
                    respect and affection for Carlos Roberto Reina and for many members of the
                    National Party, also. The Honduran military had done a creditable job and was
                    reasonably well behaved in terms of our democratic litmus test. As I say, I had
                    had dysentery. There wasn't much of a cultural life. The security situation
                    became very difficult. I was glad to move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop at this point. I want to put this on the tape,
                        so we'll know where to pick it up. Where did you go from Honduras?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I went to Stanford University. I had applied for senior training. I was
                    offered a couple of the War Colleges. However, they said that there was a
                    program for a Sloan Executive Fellowship in graduate business administration,
                    either at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] or Stanford. I said, “I've
                    served in the United States Army. I think that I know enough about military and
                    politico-military issues. I really want to know something about American
                    business. I want to know something about our economic interests, because they
                    are important.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we'll pick this up at that point and we'll talk
                        about what you learned there at Stanford as a Sloan Fellow, because I think
                        that one of the things that often is neglected is, “What are American
                        business interests?” This is particularly true in the era we're talking
                        about, which is essentially that of the Cold War. Often, when I ask people,
                        “What were American economic interests in X country,” I get a blank
                        look.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You've heard me talk about the banana companies in Central America. In
                    Argentina we had American investments in automobile manufacturing and assembling
                    and a lot of American business in sales of industrial goods, including ball
                    bearings and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick this up again when you went to Stanford in
                        1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 4, 1995. Ed, you were going to Stanford.
                        You were there for the academic year of 1970-1971?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. My family and I had not been very happy in Honduras, so I
                    pushed hard to get an assignment to senior training, or I guess that they called
                    it, “Preparation for senior training.” It's sort of the War College phase of a
                    Foreign Service career.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>The Department of State offered me a choice. I could have gone to any one of the
                    several War Colleges. Or, they said, I could be a Sloan Executive Fellow, either
                    at MIT or at Stanford. I figured, since I had served in the Army, that I didn't
                    need any more military experience to help me interface with the military as a
                    Foreign Service Officer. On the other hand I believed that the Foreign Service,
                    and particularly those of us who were in the Political Cone in the Foreign
                    Service and were not on the economic side of things, needed to interface much
                    more strongly with American business. Then there was always the odd chance that
                    one would not stay in the Foreign Service as long as I did. I thought that going
                    to a business school would be a lot more effective ticket than having gone to a
                    military war college.</p>
                <p>I chose Stanford because I grew up in California. I had done my undergraduate
                    studies in New England [at Yale]. I'm not particularly fond of New England
                    winters. [Laughter] I enjoy a certain amount of warm air and flowers. So I went
                    to Stanford. For me it was a great year. There was one other Foreign Service
                    Officer in the class, but everyone else was out of the private sector. Everybody
                    else in the class had had anywhere from 10 to 18 years of real world business
                    experience.</p>
                <p>I brought out of that experience two or three things. First of all, I learned how
                    to explain to business people what the Foreign Service does and what diplomacy
                    means. The definition is marketing and sales. The notion is that we have a
                    message, a project, a treaty, or a proposal to sell and to persuade others to
                    buy. You do this by doing exactly the same thing that a businessperson does. You
                    discover the needs and desires of your customers, you explain what you want to
                    accomplish that fits their desires. Sometimes you have to create desires. That
                    is also a part of marketing. In fact, in terms of the way you approach people
                    and the devices you use, marketing/sales and diplomacy are remarkably
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>The second thing that came from that year at Stanford was a notion of how one
                    might apply management by objectives to the Foreign Service, especially to the
                    work of political officers. It's easy enough to define objectives when there are
                    numerical measures for what is useful, for example the number of visas a
                    consular officer might issue in a day. In the case of visas you have a physical
                    output that people want and need and that you can count — literally, a stamp on
                    a piece of paper. It is much more difficult to set meaningful objectives when
                    your physical output consists of written reports that contain information that
                    may be intriguing, but not necessarily useful — useful in the sense that the
                    information advances American interests in some valuable way.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Third, I did a project with two other Sloan Fellows in the course on something
                    which now seems terribly obvious, but which I wasn't able to put across in
                    Washington when I returned. We outlined an all-digital files system that would
                    repose in Washington or some other data base center in the US, and which all of
                    our Embassies and Consulates access electronically. The Embassies and Consulates
                    could literally reduce their files to a few newspaper clippings, personal notes,
                    and working papers. Everything else would be in the central file. People would
                    have their own computers. They could call up a desired record at their desk from
                    the central file.</p>
                <p>The system included a special search capability using key word devices. That
                    would allow officers to go into, say, the political reporting records of some
                    post and say, “All right, show me the banking and family relationships of the
                    leaders of X or Y Party.” Or, “show me the family and political relationships of
                    the persons interested in this shipping firm, that aviation company,” or
                    whatever it might be. In other words, a truly relational data base in which you
                    could correlate social, economic, business, and political factors. In effect,
                    this would be the first file structure that would create a permanent,
                    institutional memory.</p>
                <p>Up until now — and even today — we have relied on the overlap of people,
                    Americans and Foreign Service Nationals, to provide institutional memory at
                    overseas posts. Institutional memory allows an officer to understand the
                    significance — or relative insignificance to the US — of whatever is happening
                    locally. It allows one to say what is really happening, or who's related to
                    whom. At international negotiations or organizations institutional memory
                    includes little ways of doing things, personality quirks of other participants,
                    and non-substantive events or precedents that may not be in the record but which
                    affect the ways other participants may work with us or against us. Some
                    institutional memory relates to the cycle of the annual calendar, the latest tit
                    for tat in the local pecking order, or whatever it may be. More often than not,
                    none of these things are in a post's records, or if they are, the current
                    officers at a post don't know it or don't have time to study the records and
                    absorb everything in them. In my experience most officers going to a given post
                    never take the time to read all of their predecessors' files. If they're lucky,
                    they have a predecessor who has written a brief memo, no longer than 10 pages,
                    outlining all of the most critical elements that they need to know. Otherwise
                    they go out and learn all the local lore for themselves — reinventing the wheel
                    all over again. Probably not more than 10 to 20% of the departing officers ever
                    get around to preparing such memos. And I think that I'm being generous with
                    those numbers. The system that the other Sloan Fellows and I designed would more
                    than substitute for that 10-page memo. It would provide a forward-looking
                    analytical machine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't this, in a way, sort of pie in the sky? We're
                        talking about 1970. I remember getting involved in trying to set up the
                        easiest type of database, a consular database. This was in 1976 or 1978. You
                        know how these computer programs change. This is almost two computer
                        generations later. It was obviously beyond the capacity of what we could
                        hook up at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>ROWELL: The answer is that it was half pie in the sky, which didn't bother me in
                    the least, because I knew that within 10 years it would not be pie in the sky. I
                    also knew enough about government inertia, if you will, to know that it would
                    take a campaign over several years to get anything going. My objective was to
                    plant the idea, get people to say, “That's a nice idea.” If you get them that
                    far, then the next step is to show them how it can be made to happen. If it
                    takes them two to three years to say, “Well, that would be nice,” and then
                    another couple of years to say, “Look, it could happen,” gradually, they'll
                    begin to think about it. We're getting closer and closer to that now.</p>
                <p>The essence of the file search system which I had in mind consisted of key words.
                    It was only three years later that we introduced the TAGS system for heading our
                    cables, our telegrams. That's a key word system. That was done for the
                    convenience of the communicators, archivers and message distributors. However,
                    it doesn't make any difference. Once we had created the TAGS system and
                    bludgeoned the Foreign Service Officer corps into making it work, so that more
                    and more people were comfortable with it and using it, we could add key words as
                    we needed them and enhance the software if necessary. The kind of thing that I
                    was advocating could have been done by the early 1980s. It certainly could
                    happen today. Although it would require a significant up-front capital
                    investment, within a short period it would reduce the number of people we need
                    to get our work done well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what the TAG system was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I no longer remember what the TAGS acronym represents, but it involves a
                    set of key words that you put at the beginning of a cable that tells the
                    communicator, who distributes the cables, and the electronic file what the
                    subject matter is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a great deal of resistance to the TAG system.
                        Some people were getting very annoyed because they had to look through a
                        rather short list. Everybody got used to it after a while, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The point is, that sort of structure is now so common that our grade
                    school children are learning it. All of our junior and mid-level officers accept
                    and use it routinely. It's partly a generational shift that was inevitable, and
                    that was easy enough to anticipate. I knew what the pace of development was,
                    both in terms of software and hardware, and the ability to have memories that
                    could handle all of this information. It was all something that clearly would
                    come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at Stanford in 1970-1971. This was not a
                        happy time because of the Vietnam War. As a State Department representative,
                        were you dragged in on Vietnam debates and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>ROWELL: No. The Vietnam issue was very sensitive. I was frankly appalled at the
                    way some faculty members, even at an institution such as Stanford, engaged in
                    loose grading and indiscipline in the academic and intellectual sense, in order
                    to save students. This country has paid a terrible price for that academic
                    laxity. We're still living through generations of people, some of whom either
                    received insufficient education or who learned to break and distort rules to
                    serve current notions of “correctness.”. This undermined the honesty of the
                    academic process. I must say that I saw this happening at most of the
                    universities across the country. I saw it happen at my own alma mater, Yale. So
                    it wasn't unique to Stanford, it wasn't unique to private institutions. It was
                    common.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think, as you say, that we're suffering because, for one
                        thing, the people who were graduating from university at that time are now
                        department heads at universities. I think that you notice this. There is a
                        lack of integrity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Integrity is suddenly defined in different ways. There are lots of
                    residual problems, and we won't recover from them for another generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to sell the business people that you were
                        dealing with on diplomacy as something which was necessary and
                        understandable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: None of them doubted it. There wasn't a problem there at all. A fifth of
                    the Sloan Fellows that year came from other countries, so everyone was conscious
                    of the international dimensions of modern economies and businesses. They were
                    curious about diplomacy and diplomats. And, of course, I disabused them of the
                    stereotypes which they carried in their minds. They were as open toward me as I
                    was toward them. In fact, we still correspond.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, in the summer of 1971 you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Came back to Washington. I was first assigned to something dealing with
                    budgets. That lasted about three weeks. Then I was assigned to the Office of the
                    Inspector General. Quite frankly, another one of my motivations in going to the
                    Business School at Stanford was to break out of ARA. I had concluded that I
                    would probably have to go to some functional bureau in the Department and, from
                    that point, establish a relationship with a geographic bureau outside of ARA. I
                    did that. The Office of the Inspector General was as good a place as any to
                    start the process, and it was interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I was in charge of compliance, evaluation of the inspection system itself and a
                    bunch of minor miscellany in the central office. Although I participated in
                    inspections once or twice a year, I wasn't permanently assigned to an inspection
                    team. I rewrote the Manual for Inspections. I introduced the concept that when
                    you inspect an overseas post, you must also inspect the corresponding offices of
                    the State Department and all the other agencies in Washington that backstop or
                    use that post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a quite new idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I introduced it, yes. I was able to persuade Tom McElhiney, the Inspector
                    General, that the posts at the overseas end of the cable line were behaving on
                    the basis of what they were receiving in cables — not just cables from the State
                    Department but from a variety of agencies. If they got the information they
                    needed and acted on it, fine. However, if information was being withheld or if
                    Washington was communicating one thing to a foreign Embassy in Washington but
                    the word wasn't being passed to our Embassy in time, you couldn't hold the post
                    responsible for its omissions. Or even for some errors, because the errors were
                    being committed in Washington. It made obvious sense. We had all known it for a
                    long time, except that it had never been made part of the inspection process. So
                    that was when we started that process.</p>
                <p>I also introduced the concept of a prepared set of issues that an inspection team
                    had to take to the field. As a result, the inspection team's preparation phase
                    in Washington became substantially longer. In effect, on the basis of their
                    Washington interviews, they had to prepare a kind of draft agenda to pursue.
                    That didn't mean that they considered only the elements on their agenda.
                    However, that had to be a principal focus. When they went to the field, they
                    either validated their conclusions or modified them and arrived at some other
                    conclusions. That was helpful because it meant that their writing task was less
                    onerous, more focused and more relevant to major US goals.</p>
                <p>It enabled a kind of peer review to take place in Washington beforehand, saying,
                    “Look, all right, so somebody doesn't like the way they're managing their local
                    hours. However, in fact, the work seems to be getting done, the accountability
                    is all right. People are not being paid for work they are not doing or vice
                    versa. Local hours, per se, are not an important issue.” There always is a range
                    of issues. The objective was to focus only on the truly significant ones —
                    significant in terms of policy impact, budget, or whatever. But not the
                    nit-picking issues. We went a long, long way to get rid of nit-picking items. I
                    think that this concept was reasonably successful. Even today, I would say that
                    the inspection process is 60-75% what we designed in the early 1970's.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point you had been around for a while. When we
                        came into the Foreign Service, the inspection was a terribly important
                        thing, when you were overseas. The inspection had a lot of power. You took
                        it very seriously, and it often was the place where bad relationships
                        developed, particularly if you were a junior officer, but even in the
                        different ranks, between rating and rated officer. These were straightened
                        out because the inspectors were considered to have a fresh eye in
                        considering problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The inspections have changed in importance. You were in the Office of the
                    Inspector General from 1971 to 1974. Where would you put the value of the
                    inspections at that point?</p>
                <p>ROWELL: The first value of inspections was, and probably still is, in the
                    preparation stage at the post. In other words, even today, people want to do
                    well in an inspection. They don't want to flub it. They DO pay attention.
                    Normally when a scheduled inspection takes place, even today — and certainly at
                    the time we are speaking of — the post is informed that an inspection is coming
                    and instructed to get ready for it. Here is what you have to do to get ready for
                    the inspection. People do it. The idea is that by the time the inspectors get
                    there, all significant deficiencies should be erased, because people have gotten
                    themselves ready for the inspection. That is the single, most important step. At
                    least that was our philosophy then, and for the most part I think that it's
                    still true. We saw the primary purpose of inspection to be improving post and
                    individual performance, not gigging individuals. Of course, is someone was
                    misbehaving (which is very different from simple inefficiency or
                    underperformance), we wanted to catch it and stop it instantly.</p>
                <p>As for the kinds of things that inspectors really look for, it is a juicy
                    tidbit—some Chief of Mission had done something improper, or something else was
                    going wrong. The kind of thing that is supposed to shake the foundations. In the
                    first place, those things are relatively rare. Secondly, as in the case of
                    financial audits at banks, you don't find them unless somebody tells tales.
                    Arthur Anderson, an auditing firm, will tell you that when they audit a company,
                    the chances are overwhelming that the audit will show that the firm is
                    absolutely straight and honest and that everything is OKAY. Unless somebody
                    anonymously slips them a piece of paper which says, “Look into the XYZ account
                    for October of last year.” Then they find the problem. But normally auditors
                    don't find things like that. The same thing is true of inspections.</p>
                <p>What else can I say about the value of inspections? When I was in the Office of
                    the Inspector General, and I think that it's been true since, the Inspector
                    General had a private channel to the Secretary of State which he could use when
                    something really nasty came back about an Embassy Chief of Mission. Anything
                    like that would be politically very sensitive, and required extreme privacy. You
                    should remember that you are dealing with the President's personal
                    representative [i. e., the Ambassador].</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Such a matter wouldn't appear in the Inspection Report. I saw several instances
                    of this at posts where there had been a serious problem. Some people were
                    totally put out with the Office of the Inspector General, because they didn't
                    read about what they regarded as the post's most serious problem in the
                    inspection report. The answer is that the tidbit was too hot to publicize. It
                    had gone to the Secretary of State, normally in an Eyes Only memo from the
                    Inspector General. The Secretary of State had to decide what he was going to do
                    about that. If you're dealing with a non-career Ambassador, the chances are
                    overwhelming that the Secretary of State isn't going to do anything about the
                    matter. The political reasons that put that person in the post in the first
                    place are probably going to override, in the judgment of the Secretary of State
                    and the White House, the cost of leaving the person there until the end of a
                    normal three-year tour. So we had almost no cases where non-career Ambassadors
                    were removed from office. It is unfortunate, but that's the way political life
                    is in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the case of career appointees, would action be taken or
                        would it be more likely to happen? For example, in case of alcohol, sexual
                        relationships, or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Career appointees generally were moved if there was a serious problem. If
                    you're talking about levels below the Chief of Mission, we still have the
                    inspectors' efficiency reports. Those reports had an effect on the work of the
                    Promotion Boards. If you had a bad report from the inspectors, it probably would
                    hurt an individual for quite some time. An exceptionally good report could
                    enhance chances of promotion. Such a report might be one which cited some
                    concrete and measurable accomplishments, things that a Selection Board could
                    refer to and say, “This is what makes this person different from the 'other 10,'
                    who are also 'great.'” Otherwise, the inspectors efficiency reports move with
                    the flow of all of the other efficiency reports. However, inspectors efficiency
                    reports DID affect careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the following decade a new Inspector General came
                        into office from outside the Department. This change was mandated by
                        Congress. Part of the rationale was that Foreign Service inspections were a
                        little bit too old boyish and too clubbish. It was felt that we needed
                        someone from outside the Foreign Service. Did you have the feeling that this
                        attitude was justified or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>ROWELL: To tell you the truth, although there was some difference in tone — that
                    is, the wording — of the reports, I never noticed that much difference in the
                    substantive content of inspectors' reports — nor in the style of inspections.
                    What really changed, when they reorganized the Office of the Inspector General,
                    was the way they consolidated and strengthened property and money auditing and
                    the investigation of wrongdoing. The latter generally involved special, rather
                    than scheduled, inspections and was a DS [Diplomatic Security] or Security
                    Officer's function. Inspections had always consisted of what I would describe as
                    management audits, plus some element of accountability auditing. That is, making
                    sure that all the property was where it was supposed to be and that the money
                    was properly accounted for.</p>
                <p>I've never forgotten my first inspection, when I was a Vice Consul. We were in
                    Recife at the time. It was very hard to get dairy products, such as eggs. The
                    entire American community trusted me to handle eggs. A man brought in eggs every
                    two weeks. I had a little pot of cash in my office safe to pay him. People gave
                    me money for the eggs, and I took the money out of this pot to pay for the eggs.
                    Then I took the eggs out to the neighborhood where most of us lived. Remember
                    that in Recife there were no private telephones. I would just deliver eggs to
                    our neighbors, and then they would give me some money. Well, the inspectors came
                    along and found this little box of pin money in the office safe and raised hell.
                    They said that this was totally prohibited, illegal, and I don't know what. I
                    probably needed to be shriven again. Anyhow, I learned a lesson about making
                    sure that nothing personal or private could come within contaminating distance
                    of anything official. That was a helpful lesson. In the totality of things, this
                    was a very minor issue, but it taught me something that I needed to know at an
                    early age, when the lesson was relatively painless, both for me and the Foreign
                    Service. Anyhow, we had auditors who looked for things like that.</p>
                <p>We've gone through cycles over the years in which the administrative audits would
                    become the most time consuming and manpower intensive of the inspection
                    activities. I think that occurred partly because of the enormous incrustation of
                    law and regulation surrounding the accountability for property and cash. The
                    other reason it is that such things easy to count. You find in all professions
                    and businesses that those things that one can measure relatively accurately and
                    easily, are measured and counted frequently, simply because it can be done.
                    Those things that are difficult to figure out, hard to measure and account for,
                    often are not tested at all, because we don't know how to do it well.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>That leads me to the final element in the Inspection Corps which, in a way, was
                    intellectually the most exhilarating. This was the search for a way to judge
                    what it is that a Political Section should be doing and what it shouldn't waste
                    its time on. That is, when is a political report worthwhile and valuable and
                    when is it not? If you can judge that, then you can focus the work of the
                    Political Officers. You can probably get along with fewer of them. Frankly, at
                    the end of the year you can produce a report that shows how each Political
                    Officer made a difference. I really didn't understand what I was doing, at
                    first. Eventually, the Inspector General saw where I was headed because of the
                    way I was wrestling with the problem. He forced me to go on inspections to test
                    the notion.</p>
                <p>What's important to understand is that engaging in activity is not necessarily
                    the same as attaining US goals or advancing US interests. Attending a certain
                    number of meetings at the Foreign Ministry, making sure that you stay in touch
                    with 25 or 50 people who are good contacts, making sure you produce at least one
                    political report a day during an entire work year — those are activities. They
                    sound like outputs. A report is a product. But is it relevant? Does it
                    contribute to those elements of our national interest, our policy, our
                    operations which are really important to us?</p>
                <p>In terms of deciding which political reports were necessary I had a kind of
                    schema for looking at a country's political structure and saying, “Well, we need
                    them or we don't need them.” If you were in Nigeria, how much time did you need
                    to spend on each of the major ethnic tribes? How much relationship did you need
                    to have with the tribes to track those things that they might do which might
                    make any difference to us? I tested this theory in Monrovia, Liberia. I tested
                    it in Paris. The answer is that it can be done, but it takes a lot of work. I
                    have to admit that much of the thinking that I went through on that — and we put
                    some of it into the Inspector's Manual — did not become an institutionalized
                    part of the Inspector General's process, except in a more general way.</p>
                <p>I certainly put this process to good use when I became a DCM and later when I was
                    a Chief of Mission. It made a big difference, because I think that I ran
                    Missions on a management-by-objectives basis that included the Political Section
                    in a very concrete way.</p>

                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>ROWELL: The Office of the Inspector General? He reported to the Under Secretary
                    for Management. He had direct access to the Secretary of State and the Deputy
                    Secretary on sensitive issues. It was a good job, equivalent to being an
                    Assistant Secretary of State. It was typically one of the stepping stones to a
                    good Mission. In McElhiney's case, he got a Mission which he wanted in East
                    Africa. But he developed some physical problem which didn't allow him to go to
                    the field and take it up. As consolation he received strong Department of State
                    backing for a UN position that was a plum and which we typically pushed to have
                    given to an American. It was one he wanted. So that was good. The same was true
                    of his successor, Jim Sutherland, who had been the Director of the Office of
                    Central European Affairs in the Bureau of European Affairs. He was Inspector
                    General for a couple of years and then wound up doing something at the UN in New
                    York. I've forgotten what it was. Again, it was something that he wanted. It
                    provided a good transition to retirement. He retired to a job that paid
                    extremely well, that was interesting, and that created a new array of social
                    relationships.</p>

                        it?</hi>

                <p>ROWELL: The Office of the Inspector General has never settled problems but only
                    elucidates them. So if something nasty pops up at a post overseas, the first
                    thing that anybody did then, and it's still true, would be to go to the
                    Inspector General's office and say, “Here's a nasty problem.” Immediately, he
                    would dispatch a team to investigate it. At that time, although they weren't
                    doing annual reports to Congress, they were doing them for the Secretary of
                    State. Nevertheless, in his annual reports the Inspector General did try to draw
                    general conclusions from everything that had come out of the inspection reports.
                    For example, if some pattern of problems was emerging. To the extent that there
                    were patterns, he would attempt to prod the State Department to institute
                    actions that would address the problems which had come up. However, again,
                    that's a matter of elucidation more than action. Sometimes, the Inspector
                    General would make helpful suggestions for approaching these problems. Almost
                    never were these suggestions the only possible way to address a problem. Almost
                    always some alternative suggestions emerged, and almost always there was some
                    kind of synthesis between the two. However, the Inspector General made people
                    aware of the problems and where there were weak spots.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: I went to the Bureau of European Affairs.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, originally, I was to move to that bureau in the summer of 1974. Jim
                    Sutherland, who had been been in European Affairs, became a sponsor for me and
                    managed to get me the right kind of hearing, so I was accepted in the bureau. In
                    that sense my strategy for escaping from Latin American Affairs had succeeded.
                    Sutherland had said that I should go to the Office of Central European Affairs.
                    I told him that that would be fascinating, but I spoke Spanish and Portuguese
                    and no German. I doubted very much that any senior manager for European Affairs
                    would want me for anything but the Office of Iberian Affairs. Conceivably, they
                    might consider that I could take a quick course in French or Italian, but I knew
                    that that was about where it was going to have to be for me to have any chance
                    at all. Sutherland fought that problem for about three months and came back and
                    told me I was right. I would be assigned to the Office of Iberian Affairs. That
                    assignment was delayed for about four months because we were negotiating the
                    renewal of base arrangements that we had with Spain.</p>
                <p>I was to go to Iberian Affairs as the Deputy Office Director. The then-Deputy
                    Director, my immediate predecessor in the position, was the Bureau of European
                    Affairs' point person on the base negotiating team. The negotiation was headed
                    by Bob McCloskey who at the time was our Assistant Secretary for Congressional
                    Relations. So it was an outside negotiating team, not a Bureau of European
                    Affairs negotiating team. McCloskey didn't want the person on whom he had been
                    relying for the European and Spanish affairs perspective to be removed from his
                    team. In the end the negotiations began to drag on much longer than anybody had
                    expected. The person I was succeeding left the Bureau, so I moved in.</p>
                <p>I arrived in the Office of Iberian Affairs at the beginning of November 1974. We
                    were just receiving back from Portugal a team that had gone to try to figure out
                    why our Embassy in Lisbon had been completely surprised by the April 25, 1974,
                    revolution in Portugal; what was the state of play in Portugal as of November;
                    and what directions should be recommended for US policy toward that NATO
                    ally.</p>
                <p>Portugal was clearly a place where we were probably going to have to provide some
                    economic and developmental assistance. Spain was a place where our base
                    agreements included larger and larger amounts of non-military cooperation. I
                    discovered during my first two weeks in Iberian Affairs that I was the only
                    person assigned to the Bureau of European Affairs who understood anything at all
                    about AID [Agency for International Development] and about development
                    assistance, including the Congressional aspects of how to manage it and the OMB
                    [Office of Management and Budget] and other White House aspects of how to manage
                    it. This was one more payoff from my earlier experience in ARA [Bureau of
                    American Republics Affairs] when it was merged with AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does show the differences between the bureaus. Let's
                        take Portugal first.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Let me put the icing on this cake. Two weeks after I arrived in the
                    Bureau of European Affairs, the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State,
                    Wells Stabler, called me into his office. Remember that I was only the green
                    Deputy Director of the Office of Iberian Affairs, not even its Director. Wells
                    said, “Secretary Kissinger is going off to Europe tonight, and he has to have
                    $25 million to put on the table to start a pledging session with our NATO allies
                    to help Portugal. Please get the money.” In fact, Wells asked me to get the
                    money by noon, because the paper on this subject was due on Secretary
                    Kissinger's desk by mid-afternoon.</p>
                <p>I went around and talked with AID. AID had been aware that Secretary Kissinger
                    was going, and they had been doing a lot of serious thinking about how to
                    produce something. They said at first, “You know, we can give you $10 million
                    now. If you make do for the time being with this level or something less, we
                    have the legislative and regulatory authority to sign the paper now, which the
                    Secretary can carry with him and place on the table.” The AID people said, “We
                    know that he wants the $25 million, but that much money requires notification to
                    Congress, a two month process.” Neither they nor I had to waste a lot of time
                    discussing this, because I knew they were right about the rules and they were
                    trying their hardest to help.</p>
                <p>So, without checking back with EUR, I said, “All right, I'll take the $10
                    million. Give me the paper right now.” I went back to Wells Stabler just before
                    lunch. He blew a fuse. He said, “I told you that I wanted $25 million. The
                    Secretary has to have $25 million.”</p>
                <p>I was the new kid on the block in EUR. I had never dealt with Wells Stabler at
                    all. He had never dealt with me. In a sense we were testing each other, as
                    always happens. In essence, I told him what AID had been telling me, which I
                    knew was right. I drew on my ARA experience and said to Wells Stabler, “You
                    know, these rules really exist. They're not making this up.” I said, “I thought
                    that it was better to be able to go to the Secretary and say, 'I've got this
                    money, right now, today.'” I told Wells, “I can get you the rest of the money,
                    but it's going to take three and a half weeks at a minimum if we're very lucky,
                    and it may take two months. I don't think that that helps the Secretary today.”
                    Wells grumbled, marched out of the office, and I never heard about it again.
                    Secretary Kissinger took the $10 million, and it was enough. It got the NATO
                    pledging session going, which is what we needed.</p>
                <p>I should correct the numbers I've been citing. The “10” and the “25” are correct.
                    But it's possible they were thousands, not millions. Ten million dollars would
                    have been a very large sum in 1974, quite possibly too big for AID to reprogram
                    without Congressional notification.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you in Iberian Affairs? I would like to
                        understand what years were involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I arrived in November, 1974, and departed in July, 1978, to go to
                    Portugal as Deputy Chief of Mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in the Office of
                        Iberian Affairs, and would you talk about our Embassy in Lisbon at that time
                        and some of the troubles which had immediately preceded this, as well as
                        something about Henry Kissinger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Portuguese had had a revolution on April 25, 1974. They had
                    overthrown the Salazar-Caetano regime, which had been in power since the 1920's.
                    The genesis of the revolution had been the slow but unending loss of Portuguese
                    lives in colonial wars. The ousted regime had been trying to hang onto
                    Portugal's five colonies in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Angola, Mozambique...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Plus three tiny ones, Guinea-Bissau, S�o Tom�, and Principe. A
                    substantial share of the Portuguese military forces, particularly in Angola and
                    Mozambique, had had intimate contact with Marxist proselytizers who were their
                    prisoners. They would capture guerrillas. Then they'd sit around the campfires,
                    and all would talk with each other. [Laughter] So there was a certain amount of
                    communication going back and forth here between the guerrillas and the
                    Portuguese armed forces. The exchange consisted mostly of ideas, not ideologies.
                    The Portuguese armed forces also had proposed to the Caetano Government a
                    strategy for exiting from the colonial wars.</p>
                <p>It was a very simple strategy. It said, “Let's concentrate our military power on
                    one colony at a time, dominate that colony so that we write the rules for
                    negotiations, but then negotiate to 'get out.' This will let us 'get out' in a
                    way that leaves our economic and business interests intact. We can give them
                    political liberties but save our economic interests. There will be a
                    'demonstration' effect. The first such negotiation will be hard. So we should
                    start with the smallest and most vulnerable colony. We'll make it work. Then
                    we'll start with the next colony and make that work. By the time we've done the
                    three little colonies, the big colonies will perceive that it's not a bad thing
                    to go into negotiations, because they get what they want, and the war is
                    over.”</p>
                <p>Actually, I thought that it was a good strategy. The Caetano Government rejected
                    it, partly at the behest of the monied aristocracy. The Government insisted that
                    it was going to hold on to everything at all cost. The military said, “Well,
                    we're tired of losing lives under a strategy that is no strategy at all. We
                    can't succeed with this.” So there was a revolution.</p>
                <p>The officers who led the revolution said, and genuinely intended, that there
                    would be a democracy. There would be a full market economy and a kind of social
                    justice in Portugal, while the colonies were to be free. But the military
                    leaders still wanted to preserve a decent, economic relationship with the
                    colonies.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The communists, who often tend to be the best organized among parties that have
                    to exist clandestinely, attempted to take control of the revolution in Portugal
                    and came very close to doing so. The only significant bulwark against the
                    communists was the Socialist Party, the next party on the Left, but a Democratic
                    Party. The Portuguese communists were old-line Stalinists. They were the worst
                    kind of anti-democratic ideologues that you could imagine. I won't burden you
                    with the details of the aftermath of the Portuguese revolution, except to say
                    that it was remarkably bloodless at the outset. There was a failed
                    counterrevolution in March, 1975, and a failed counter- counterrevolution in
                    November, 1975. The November 1975 event had followed a street parade in July,
                    1975, in Lisbon, when the Socialist leader, Mario Soares, stood at the head of
                    10,000 people marching down Lisbon's main street, demanding democracy and the
                    ouster of the communist-influenced members of the Council of the Revolution.
                    That Council was the military body which was running Portugal at the time.</p>
                <p>That was the moment when a good Foreign Service Officer, Bill Kelly, who later
                    resigned from the Service to join a good, private company in the US, wrote a
                    memorandum to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, saying, “Mario Soares:
                    standing tall in a deep hole.” It was a graceful memorandum, four-fifths of a
                    page long. It was beautifully phrased, and it captured Henry Kissinger. It was a
                    real tour de force.</p>
                <p>For months Frank Carlucci, our new Ambassador in Lisbon since February 1975, and
                    Art Hartman, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, had been
                    trying to get the Secretary to agree to put more resources into Portugal to help
                    the democratic forces there. Kissinger believed that Communists couldn't be
                    ousted via democratic processes once they had attained certain levers of power,
                    as they had by then in Portugal. We in Iberian Affairs kept cranking out memos
                    to try to persuade Kissinger, and Hartman kept rejecting them, saying, “Not
                    Yet.” Hartman had gotten Kissinger to recognize that he couldn't kick Portugal
                    out of NATO just because he thought that it had gone communist. There isn't
                    anything in NATO's charter or rules that provides for kicking a member out. The
                    other allies would not even discuss an ad hoc mechanism to do that. Kissinger
                    didn't want to tear up NATO. So Hartman waited until he had the right hook to
                    get Kissinger's favorable attention for Carlucci's help-the-democratic-forces
                    strategy. The hook was Soares' dramatic, personally risky march down the Avenida
                    da Liberdade in Lisbon. The march showed there were real democratic forces
                    prepared to take risks to eject the Communists — people who could make a
                    difference if Portugal's NATO allies helped it.</p>
                <p>The day after Soares led the march down Lisbon's main street, and clearly that
                    was on the first page of whatever memo was going to Kissinger's desk, Hartman
                    said, “Now.” It was about 9:00 AM. At 11:00 or 11:30 AM. Bill Kelly's memorandum
                    went up to Kissinger. It caught Kissinger just right. So if timing is everything
                    in politics, Art Hartman had it. He knew when to submit the memo, and we had a
                    superb Foreign Service Officer who knew how to write it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that it's very interesting, showing the mechanics
                        and machinations of your choice. Within the Department there is a battle for
                        the mind of the Secretary of State. In this case a very powerful Secretary
                        of State. It's not just a question of feeding information to the Secretary
                        as a normal thing, but holding off, as Arthur Hartman felt, until we can
                        make an impression on the Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. As you say, Kissinger was a very strong Secretary of State
                    — not just powerful but a very strong personality who had great confidence in
                    his own judgment. So the issue with all memoranda, even if they're just going
                    to, say, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, is to send them when the
                    addressee is going to be the most open to the message, so that the message can
                    get through. There's no point in sending mail to an address that is temporarily
                    shut down.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, Art Hartman was right. I didn't argue with him, though I was
                    frustrated, because he was the one who was seeing the Secretary frequently. He
                    was the one who was supposed to judge how to relate to the Seventh Floor of the
                    Department of State, where the most senior officers had their offices. That was
                    Art's job. We were supposed to support him. However, it was clear, in his
                    judgment, that if you sent a steady stream of messages on a difficult subject
                    even though they were unlikely to get through, then the material they were
                    reporting wasn't going to be very helpful. In fact the long stream might even
                    rob the right memo of effect when the right moment arose to sent it. The long
                    stream creates a negative bias. Although you risk never finding a good opening,
                    you have to save your ammunition for the moment when its expenditure is most
                    likely to win your battle.</p>
                <p>I'll give you another example of how Art dealt with Kissinger. Most of the time
                    Kissinger would never allow anyone below the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    to attend policy or strategy meetings in his office except for some of his
                    immediate personal assistants. Art got Kissinger to let me be notetaker at one
                    meeting on Portugal. (The appropriate Deputy Assistant Secretary was out of
                    town.) Actually, I didn't write down much because most of the discussion
                    involved matters that represented nothing new either in terms of the situation
                    or in terms of US thinking and approaches to the issues. Two or three times Art
                    turned and looked at me fiercely. When we were in the corridor walking back to
                    our offices, Art hissed, “Why weren't you writing?” I said, “No one was saying
                    anything worth recording.” Art replied, “That makes no difference. Henry allows
                    no one in his meetings except persons who have a serious reason to be there. You
                    have to look like your busy and contributing even if nothing is going on. If
                    there is ever a second time you're in one of Henry's meetings, keep writing all
                    the time, no matter what.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this whole Portuguese case is one of our more
                        significant, diplomatic involvements. I think that the Foreign Service and
                        the role of Embassy personalities and all of that played a much greater role
                        than in many other cases. Here you were, the Deputy Director of the Office
                        of Iberian Affairs, the new boy on the block. Were you aware of what you
                        might call the battle within the Department of State and where we go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The answer is yes. I arrived in Iberian Affairs just before the onset of
                    this battle. When I arrived in that office, as I think I mentioned earlier, a
                    Special Investigative Team was just getting ready to return to the Department.
                    The team consisted of Peter De Vos, who is now one of our Ambassadors in Africa;
                    Alan Lukens, who was the Director of Iberian Affairs; and, I think, one other
                    person. They had gone to Portugal because Secretary of State Kissinger and
                    Assistant Secretary of State Hartman wanted an evaluation of the performance of
                    the Embassy in Lisbon, both in terms of what had happened in the weeks leading
                    up to the revolution of April, 1974, why we hadn't anticipated it and that kind
                    of thing, and the Embassy's responses since then.</p>
                <p>Let me step back a minute and say that in February 1974 there had been one failed
                    coup attempt. So clearly things were cooking somewhere in the colonies or in
                    Portugal. We had Consulates General in what was then Louren�o Marques, which
                    today is Maputo in Mozambique, and in Luanda, Angola. We had some people in the
                    field in Africa. We had the Embassy in Portugal. However, the coup which became
                    a genuine revolution caught everyone by surprise. The Embassy in Lisbon was
                    about as thinly manned an Embassy as any we had in Europe at the time, with the
                    possible exception of Luxembourg. It had a one-man Political Section and perhaps
                    one or two other agency people from the Central Intelligence Agency. We had one
                    Economic Officer. There was a very small Defense Attach� office. The Embassy was
                    minuscule. Not enough people to do much traveling to anywhere. The Ambassador
                    was an attorney, a non-career appointee. There was a good career officer, Dick
                    Post, as the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission], but the small size of the Mission
                    made it difficult to cover much of what was going on outside of Lisbon. And the
                    plotters, who faced execution or long imprisonment if they were caught, were not
                    about to talk with us.</p>
                <p>The Embassy just didn't have the people to be listening for signs of a
                    revolution. Portugal is a very close-mouthed society. You have to spend a lot of
                    time there and get to know a lot of people before you begin to understand what's
                    going on. That was true in my experience AFTER the revolution. Before the
                    revolution things were even tighter.</p>
                <p>To help you understand how tight it was, I've told you the story of military
                    frustration which brought on the revolution. Portugal had essentially a
                    mercantilist, economic structure in which a limited number of families had
                    licenses to own and operate the most important businesses, such as steel,
                    shipbuilding, some communications devices (posts and telegraph were government
                    owned), and tobacco. These were essentially licensed monopolies.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The Salazar-Caetano economic strategy was to use the colonies as a safety valve
                    for excess population, while the home territory was preserved almost as
                    something like a gigantic game park. That's an exaggeration, but there were big
                    farms in the Alentejo area south of the Tagus River. They were being operated
                    and maintained in the way they had been operated and maintained for centuries.
                    The northern part of the country was much more industrial. It consisted of small
                    holdings. The principal industry there was textiles. There was some
                    shipbuilding, some fishing, and ceramics were important. Again, these
                    enterprises were in the hands of a relatively small number of investors and
                    industrialists. Everybody else was at the bottom of the wage scale. They had
                    zero inflation, so that an ordinary Portuguese could save $2 a week for 20 years
                    and have the money to buy a refrigerator. At the end of 20 years it literally
                    cost the same amount of money in escudos as it cost when they started saving $2
                    a week.</p>
                <p>But the society was very tight, because they were able to use the colonies as
                    social safety valves. The surplus population never reached the point of creating
                    urban agglomerations that could become socially explosive. The point I'm making
                    is that we were dealing with a very tight, very close-mouthed, and very discreet
                    society. They didn't talk with a lot of people, either, so finding out what was
                    going on was no simple task. We had stripped the Embassy down to practically
                    nothing. It had been that way for years. Portugal had been stable, we had our
                    base rights in the Azores Islands, Portugal had been a reliable member of NATO,
                    and we weren't paying that much attention to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as ambassadorial appointments were concerned, it
                        was sort of a good pay-off and it was European...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was a good pay-off. It was in Europe. The Ambassador's name at the
                    time of the revolution was Stuart Nash Scott. He was a man with a good mind who
                    was serious about doing a good job. He had an understaffed Embassy and a
                    Washington establishment that didn't want to get involved in Portuguese
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>After the Special Investigative Team returned from Portugal in November 1974,
                    Kissinger persuaded President Nixon we should send Frank Carlucci as Ambassador.
                    At the time he was the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health, Education,
                    and Welfare [HEW]. Frank was a career Foreign Service Officer. Obviously, he was
                    very good. Carlucci was nominated to be Ambassador at the beginning of December,
                    1974, and I was the briefing officer who helped him to prepare for his Senate
                    confirmation hearings. We formed a partnership that lasted throughout his three
                    years in Portugal. I was at the Washington end and Carlucci was at the Portugal
                    end. I've already mentioned that I learned something of how to deal with
                    Kissinger from Art Hartman. I learned more of Secretary Kissinger's attitudes
                    and how to deal with him from Ambassador Carlucci. Whenever Carlucci was in
                    Washington to plead the case for his help-the-democrats strategy, he had to
                    bleed on someone following his conversations with Kissinger. I was the one who
                    was there, and I had the right clearances and responsibilities.</p>
                <p>When Carlucci visited Washington to argue with Kissinger, he [Carlucci] would
                    start his day with a 6:00 AM multi-mile run. When I arrived at my desk around
                    7:30 AM Carlucci would be leaning back in my chair with his feet on the desk. We
                    would discuss the approach he planned to take with Kissinger and the way he
                    would test it first with Art Hartman. I would tell Carlucci what I knew of the
                    latest twists in Washington on Portuguese issues. Then late in the afternoon
                    Carlucci would come back and we would discuss how things had gone. We would talk
                    about next moves to make things happen the way Carlucci wanted them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We do want to capture this because this is one of the
                        great moments of the Foreign Service. The arrival of what you might say was

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Who was a career Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was a career Foreign Service Officer up against a
                        powerful Secretary of State. Give me a little feel for the attitude of Frank
                        Carlucci. He had been a career Foreign Service Officer. All of a sudden, he
                        had moved over to other government departments. He had become almost the
                        fair-haired troubleshooter of the Nixon administration, moving to other
                        things. How did you view this when you were talking to him, when he moved
                        back into his original career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Carlucci always enjoyed a challenge. Portugal was a challenge — any way
                    you wanted to look at it. The base privileges in the Azores were critical to a
                    lot of our strategies relating both to the Middle East and to reinforcement of
                    NATO in Europe. The notion that communists could take over a NATO country was
                    born, and the risk was real and visible. The situation in Portugal was murky,
                    volatile, violent and life-threatening. People could say that the situation in
                    Portugal was a big deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>In a sense, I suppose, one could assert that assignment as Ambassador to Portugal
                    was a “come down” for Carlucci. HEW managed very large numbers of people and
                    huge amounts of money. But I never saw anything in Carlucci that suggested that
                    he regretted going to Portugal. I think that he relished the challenge. He
                    wanted to be the guy who could turn the situation around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out by the time Carlucci went out as
                        Ambassador to Portugal? About when was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I think that he arrived at post in February, 1975. He was preceded by his
                    hand-picked DCM, Herb Okun, who replaced Dick Post, Ambassador Scott's DCM, in
                    December 1974 or early January 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude at that point, when he arrived in
                        Portugal, of Secretary of State Kissinger toward Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Kissinger's attitude was, “Either fix the communist problem or amputate
                    it.” He knew it probably wasn't possible to push Portugal out of NATO, so the
                    next best thing would be to isolate Portugal within NATO. Ideally, Kissinger
                    wanted to fix it, but he was skeptical that it could be fixed. In Kissinger's
                    experience no country that had started a revolutionary process, in which the
                    communists held substantial cards because of their pre-positioning, had ever
                    succeeded in escaping communist capture. I believe that he was particularly
                    thinking of the Eastern European countries and their experience in the late
                    1940's. Then there had been the Cuban experience since 1959. Just looking at
                    20th century European history, Kissinger had every right to be concerned.</p>
                <p>So Carlucci went out to Portugal. Meantime, the Bureau of Political-Military
                    Affairs [PM] and the Office of Regional Political-Military Affairs in EUR
                    [Bureau of European Affairs] had concluded that you couldn't throw Portugal out
                    of NATO and simply amputate it, without tearing up NATO. There simply weren't
                    any institutional elements for doing that kind of thing. So Kissinger's
                    instructions to Carlucci were, “All right, rescue Portugal from the communists.”
                    I don't think that Kissinger had much faith that it could be done, but we had to
                    try.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Carlucci arrived in Lisbon and became convinced that it could be done. He spent
                    months arguing with Kissinger about resources and other things. In one sense,
                    though, Kissinger told Carlucci, “Tell me what you need, and you'll have it.” So
                    Carlucci fought the battle on the only option open. The Embassy in Lisbon
                    quickly doubled or tripled its staff. There was a huge buildup. We had economic
                    assistance and some military assistance programs. We did all the classic things.
                    We looked around to see which political forces and which political groupings
                    were both willing to fight the Communists and potentially viable under a new
                    democratic constitution. Here we're talking about individuals and groupings in
                    economic structures, as well as the military and political organizations and
                    parties, because the revolution had nationalized the banks and all of the
                    securities that related to mortgages and promissory notes. There were hundreds
                    and even thousands of businesses that had no resources. We had to know who, in
                    all of these structures, were not communists; who were the socialists in the
                    classical sense of the word; who were the social democrats in the post World War
                    II sense; who were the democratic conservatives.</p>
                <p>There were conservatives still in the country, but the most conservative people
                    were harassed and they and their families were physically threatened. Some of
                    them left the country. Some of them were strip-searched when they left,
                    ostensibly to make sure they were taking valuables, even their own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: A lot of them went to Brazil. Some of them went to other places — other
                    parts of Western Europe, Venezuela, South Africa.</p>
                <p>Let me give you another example of frightening harassment. The Democratic Social
                    Center (CDS — Centro Democratico Social), an affiliate of Western Europe's
                    Christian Democrats, tried to hold an organizing convention in the Crystal
                    Palace in Oporto in January 1975. The authorities in Oporto refused to provide
                    special security and then did nothing when the far left encouraged crowds to
                    form outside the Crystal Palace and to stone it. The conventioneers were trapped
                    inside for more than a day and a half. It was frightening in the extreme. After
                    a day and a half or two days, a military unit from outside of Oporto came into
                    the city, the crowds around the Crystal Palace melted, and the conventioneers
                    exited safely, albeit exhausted and tense.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the far left overplayed its hand. In the first half of 1975, I don't
                    remember which month, the Bishop of Braga visited Brazil. He was beloved by the
                    vast majority of the people throughout northern Portugal. On his departure from
                    Portugal, he was strip-searched at the airport in Oporto. Word of this got out
                    when he returned three weeks later. At that moment the Communists lost whatever
                    slim hope they might have had to hang on to any power by democratic means. Some
                    time later mobs raided the Communists' offices and destroyed their records.</p>

                        particularly during the Nixon/Kissinger period, did you have the feeling
                        that the Central Intelligence Agency was doing things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There are details that I will not talk about, but which are not important
                    for understanding what we did and how it was managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Ambassador Carlucci was very much in charge, and no US government
                    personnel did anything that he hadn't approved beforehand. He, all of us,
                    scrupulously met all of our statutory obligations. The Political Section, as I
                    say, identified every democratic force that could do anything. We supported all
                    the democratic forces, including their efforts to organize. We also worked
                    closely with West European countries. The Europeans, particularly the Germans,
                    had their government-financed political institutes which corresponded to their
                    major democratic parties: the Social Democrats, the Free Democrats, and the
                    Christian Democrats/Christian Social Union. Using these institutes, the German
                    parties helped their Portuguese analogs to build membership and organize for
                    elections. We didn't have counterpart political party structures, or institutes,
                    as the Germans did. The National Republican Institute and the National
                    Democratic Institute were created later partly as a result of our Portugal
                    experience and our observation of the way the Germans used their political
                    institutes.</p>
                <p>The French Socialist Party poured a lot of money into the Portuguese Socialist
                    Party. Mario Soares, the head of the Portuguese Socialist Party, had spent years
                    in Paris, as well as years in exile in the Portuguese colonies for advocating
                    democracy (and socialism) in Portugal. Soares knew the French leaders very well,
                    including Fran�ois Mitterrand, head of the French Socialist Party and later
                    President of France.</p>
                <p>We provided military assistance and worked closely with Portugal's armed forces —
                    the vast majority of Portuguese military personnel wanted democracy, not
                    Communists or communism. We led NATO efforts to provide assistance to help
                    Portugal's armed forces to convert themselves from a colonial war structure to
                    an establishment totally appropriate for NATO missions.</p>
                <p>We provided loans for food and fodder when Portugal was running enormous trade
                    deficits after the revolution. We provided a major $300 million Exchange
                    Stabilization Fund loan to tide Portugal over during a liquidity crisis. We
                    provided assistance for housing, municipal water systems, education and tools to
                    help the country absorb the 700,000 refugees who returned from the colonies
                    1974-75.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Our West European allies also provided substantial assistance. And they offered
                    the possibility of membership in the European Economic Communities (consummated
                    in 1986) to help build and consolidate a democratic outcome.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about labor organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We had the AFL/CIO [American Federation of Labor/Congress of Industrial
                    Organizations] programs to help democratic labor groups to organize.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 4, Side A, of the interview with Ambassador
                        Ed Rowell. When you arrived in the Office of Iberian Affairs, what was the
                        evaluation of the communist leadership in Portugal, as well as the role of
                        the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The communists were well organized and well established. Their leader,
                    �lvaro Cunhal, had a charismatic personality. He had a strong personal
                    appearance — thick white hair, a deep voice, bushy eyebrows. His voice carried
                    authority when he spoke. Further, in the immediate post- revolutionary euphoria,
                    Portugal opened diplomatic relations with practically every socialist and
                    communist country in the world, although they may have overlooked one or two.
                    The Embassies of the Eastern European countries and of the Soviet Union had free
                    movement, in every sense of the word. Their staffs increased, they channeled
                    money and probably some physical goods into Portugal, although I don't recall
                    any particular instances. On at least two occasions they were caught red-handed
                    trying to help foment civil disturbances and to finance a sort of communist
                    counterattack when the communists were starting to lose out. Remember also that
                    the Soviets and West European Communists had been helping the Portuguese
                    Communist Party when it was still a clandestine organization. All of the
                    mechanisms for moving money, people and equipment into Portugal were well
                    greased and running smoothly. Front companies in Western Europe were one of the
                    preferred mechanisms. By the time Carlucci arrived, the Soviets and some of the
                    Eastern Europeans were already well dug in in Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the very beginning how did you on the desk evaluate the
                        coup leadership, the military leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>ROWELL: At the beginning, most of these people were unknown. So the evaluation
                    started after the revolution. The principal leader at the time was Lt. Colonel
                    Ramalho Eanes, who later became a general and then president of the country. He
                    was not a communist. I don't think that he was even a Marxist. From a
                    conservative perspective he was clearly on the left. He was dedicated to the
                    revolution and, as I may have said earlier, to democracy and to an open economic
                    system. An open economic system meant one in which ordinary people could have
                    access to education and a chance to have decent jobs and real incomes. They
                    would not have to leave the country if they wanted to escape poverty.</p>
                <p>He had a number of close associates: Majors Vitor Alves and Melo Antunes (whose
                    first name I have forgotten). I've forgotten the names of most of the members of
                    the Council of the Revolution whom Eanes brought in with him and who were
                    organizers of the revolution. They chose as their first titular leader Marshal
                    Sp�nola. He was insufficiently leftist for them and left after a few months.
                    Next Marshal Costa Gomes who eventually was named President, an office he held
                    until, I believe, 1976. I don't know whether he had a well-formed philosophy of
                    governance or an ideology. But he was always very open — emotionally open — to
                    the far Left. Regardless of whether he had a party affiliation, Costa Gomes was
                    the communist Trojan horse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Ambassador Carlucci arrived in Portugal, there were
                        two things. One was just to report on what was happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: But that was the smaller part of his job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much smaller.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The more substantial part of his job was to figure out who our potential
                    friends were, who the hard core opponents were, and then attempt to create
                    programs to help the former and contain the latter. The communists, who had
                    infiltrated people into the government bureaucracy over the years, surfaced
                    almost immediately. They nationalized the banks and the insurance companies. One
                    of the first sets of files they obtained contained the names of all of the
                    people who were involved in the financial structure of every important business
                    and family in the country. If you understand the financial structure of a
                    country, then you understand where the strong and weak points are. You know
                    which buttons to press and how to command people. There was a lot of harassment
                    of all anti-communists.</p>
                <p>The communists had also taken over a lot of social services, so that they could
                    ingratiate themselves with the population. Anyhow, as I say, we wanted to
                    encourage those who were in the ministries and who were not communists and who
                    were appalled by the Communist effort to take over the revolution. Their
                    intention had never been to make Portugal into a Soviet satellite. They wanted a
                    free country.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>There were military officers who were powerfully influenced by the communists.
                    There were other military people who were extremely conservative, and a lot of
                    military in the middle. So we had to find out who was who and then develop
                    military assistance programs that reinforced those who would support the
                    democratic structure. And oppose those military people who basically favored the
                    communists.</p>
                <p>What military people favored the communists? One of them was the Portuguese
                    Admiral in charge of the final Portuguese withdrawal from Angola. His name was
                    Rosa Coutinho. Under the agreement for withdrawal he was supposed to dump
                    Portuguese arms in the ocean. Instead, he handed them over to the MPLA (Marxist)
                    Government in Luanda, Angola. Another one, whose name escapes me now, commanded
                    some significant military units around the Lisbon area. This meant that he might
                    have been in a position to seize some government ministries at a critical
                    moment, if that was going to tip the balance. He clearly supported the
                    communists — for whatever reason, I don't know. He later went to jail for a
                    while, after which he ran unsuccessfully for national office. We didn't
                    necessarily worry about going too deeply into reasons why people supported
                    Communist positions. It was enough to know where people stood at that time.</p>
                <p>So, having identified our friends, we supported them and put a fair amount of
                    effort, including money, into that support. The military support went to
                    military units that were democratic. Financial support went to democratic
                    groups, including paying for technical assistance. How do you organize voters?
                    How do you enlist people in your party? How do you help the press to become more
                    democratic? Some of the things that we were doing were things that have been
                    done in Eastern Europe since the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Portugal was free enough so that you could do these
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, but the harassment was spectacular. For example, there was this
                    officer, whose name I don't remember, who commanded the military regiment
                    responsible for security in Lisbon. He went on television one night in 1975 and
                    said, “Well, things are very tough.” He said that he couldn't guarantee the
                    personal security of the American Ambassador. Carlucci saw that telecast. Before
                    the telecast was over, Carlucci presented himself at the television studio and
                    demanded the right to speak to the cameras. They were so flabbergasted that they
                    let him do it! He demanded a retraction. He said that he was the American
                    Ambassador, he represented a NATO ally, a democratic country. We were supporting
                    Portugal's democracy, and he didn't expect any problems. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have caught the attention of...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It caught everybody's attention! But he didn't let this guy go
                    unanswered. It was a matter of his force of personality. This was somebody we
                    needed to do something about. Carlucci was always a very strong personality.</p>
                <p>He was very active also in encouraging the democratic political parties to
                    reinforce each other in affirming democratic processes. There were two or three
                    referenda and elections from early 1975 to early 1976. That was when a
                    constitutional convention was organized, a constitution drafted and approved,
                    and a first parliament and president were selected under the new constitution.
                    It was the peak of the struggle between totalitarian left — communism — and
                    democratic left, center and right represented respectively by the Socialists
                    (PS), Social Democrats (PSD) and Social Democratic Center (CDS). So many
                    conservatives had left the country that the CDS was the only “conservative”
                    force remaining, although by most European standards it qualified as a very
                    moderate center-right group at the time. The Communists and fringe ultra-left
                    parties tried to harass and disenfranchise the CDS claiming it represented the
                    old “fascism”. Carlucci went to the PS and PSD and told them they had to oppose
                    this far left effort and stand up for the right of the CDS to participate in the
                    political process. At first the PS and PSD resisted. After all they were
                    competing with the CDS. Carlucci said the CDS was democratic, and if the others
                    parties allowed the Communists to slice off that piece of salami, the next
                    target of extreme harassment would be the Social Democrats. After that would
                    come the Socialists. And each time, because the party being attacked would be
                    the right-most party in the country at the time, the Communists and their allies
                    would claim, as they were asserting re the CDS, that the object of attack was
                    nothing but neo-fascism, not democratic, not worthy of defense. The Socialists
                    and Social Democrats immediately saw the light and started to argue for the
                    right of the CDS to participate peacefully and tranquilly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time you had two things going. We had this
                        critical base on the Azores. I must say—I have no idea what it is, so I can
                        say it—that I'm sure that we would not have seen that place shut down
                        without some sort of response. However, how had the Azores base developed?
                        How had this peculiar relationship developed? You never hear of Portuguese
                        units in NATO. Portugal may be in NATO, but it seems like membership without
                        participation. What was the situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, you didn't hear about Portuguese units in NATO because until the
                    revolution of 1974 Portuguese units were virtually all in Africa. That had been
                    a difficult problem for NATO. On the one hand, NATO wanted Portuguese units to
                    work with NATO. They would have to meet certain training and equipment
                    standards. On the other hand, the NATO countries didn't want to be seen to be
                    supporting the last of the colonial wars in Africa. So there was little or no
                    joint training with Portugal — it wouldn't have worked because the Portuguese
                    were structured for colonial wars, not NATO. And there was no significant
                    military aid for Portugal, even though it was relatively poor as a NATO country.
                    The military relationship with Portugal was strained.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>After the revolution, obviously the country was fully taken up with consolidating
                    the democratic outcome. The country was so financially strapped that there was
                    no questioning the need to re-equip its forces to meet NATO standards. There was
                    a lot of head scratching as to what Portugal's role in NATO should be. Portugal
                    had committed some paratroops to NATO, and Portugal had some naval vessels which
                    were committed to SACLANT [Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic] for
                    anti-submarine work. That made sense in view of Portugal's possession of the
                    Azores and its location near the Straits of Gibraltar. These were appropriate
                    roles and more or less within reach. So there was a NATO effort to help Portugal
                    to get some modern frigates and a certain amount of supplies and equipment for
                    the paratroops and some of the other Portuguese Army forces. Later there was an
                    effort to help Portugal to upgrade its air defenses so it could help protect its
                    harbors and other facilities in the event of a NATO clash with the Warsaw
                    Pact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had there been any movement toward restricting the
                        use of the Azores during this whole period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. The vast majority of the Portuguese military wanted to stay in NATO
                    as a means to shore up the democratic nature of the revolution. There was no
                    thought of restricting use of the Azores. That would have been seen as a
                    rejection of NATO. There was a desire to use the contribution of the Azores as a
                    rationale to justify greater and faster assistance to refurbish the Portuguese
                    military for NATO roles.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of the Portuguese armed forces' behavior is perhaps even more
                    telling. In the immediate post-revolution period, and for about one or two years
                    afterwards, Portuguese military officers who were assigned to NATO offices in
                    various parts of Europe voluntarily absented themselves from those meetings
                    where sensitive NATO defense issues were discussed. These meetings covered
                    nuclear and certain other most sensitive planning efforts. The Portuguese
                    officers volunteered not to receive any of the most sensitive written reports,
                    also. So those reports did not go to the Portuguese representatives in NATO or
                    to their offices. The Portuguese didn't have them and therefore couldn't send
                    them to Lisbon. There was no way that they could be leaked in Lisbon to the
                    Soviets. NATO had been wrestling with this problem, and the Portuguese
                    representatives felt that the appropriate thing for them to do was to take this
                    voluntary initiative. That saved NATO the problem of trying to figure out how to
                    make sure that nothing leaked from a Portuguese military office in Brussels, via
                    Lisbon, to Moscow. The Portuguese officers solved that problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Then, when the communist threat was over, they just said, “Well, now it's time to
                    go back to normal.” All the NATO allies agreed, and the Portuguese resumed their
                    normal roles and involvement in NATO. In fact even a little more, because they
                    then took over the Iberian Atlantic Command (IBERLANT), based in Lisbon.
                    Previously, an American admiral had always headed the command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this situation play out? We're really talking
                        about 1975, for the most part, and later on, too. How did this work out,
                        from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It actually played out over a longer period of time, because the
                    Portuguese economy was in such desperate straits. They went into a serious
                    liquidity crisis, for example, in 1976. They had had to absorb a huge number of
                    Portuguese refugees from the colonies. There were about 700,000 people involved
                    in this flow, amounting to something over 7.5% of the population. That's quite a
                    number. Had that been the United States in the 1960's, it would have been the
                    equivalent of absorbing 15 million Cuban refugees instead of the 700,000 that we
                    actually took. It would have been a madhouse. The 9.5 million people in Portugal
                    had to absorb as many returning colonial families as we absorbed Cubans. It was
                    an enormous strain on the Portuguese Treasury. A lot of public services broke
                    down, and tax collections didn't work very well.</p>
                <p>There was chaos, because of the way the existing banking and insurance system had
                    been taken over by the government. Chaos, because the workers in many companies
                    simply took them over. That includes restaurant workers and well as those in
                    factories. They believed far left propaganda that claimed the companies were far
                    richer than they really were, that the former owners and managers had simply
                    been greedily exploiting workers. There probably had been some exploitation in
                    many cases. But the workers had no idea how to run businesses, and they wound up
                    bankrupting just about everything they tried to run. Portugal went through five
                    very difficult years, economically. These were years when they were so stressed
                    that we, and other NATO allies, went out of our way to figure out what we could
                    do to help them — until they could get on their feet and take care of
                    themselves. They did that, over a five year period. However, we had significant
                    economic and military assistance programs, and I think that they worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? This mass demonstration of 10,000
                        people, and Mario Soares standing tall and Bill Kelly reporting on it. Then
                        Arthur Hartman said, “Now's the time...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: “Now's the time,” and Henry Kissinger came back and said, “Right. There
                    are democratic forces there in Portugal who, if we support them, will be able to
                    beat the communists.” That's what persuaded Henry Kissinger that what Frank
                    Carlucci had been sent out to do, could be done. So we continued.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I'm not sure what details to go into, because I've described the essential
                    elements already.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were there problems with Congress at that time or
                        was this not a particular difficulty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Not really. Congress understood that if there were some way to make
                    Portugal come out on the democratic side, it had to be tried. There were the
                    usual questions about whether we really the right programs and whether we were
                    proposing the right amounts of assistance.</p>
                <p>I made one tactical error. The US Treasury had given Portugal a temporary loan of
                    $300 million from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The Portuguese gold
                    stock was the collateral. This loan was to relieve their liquidity crisis. Later
                    I had recommended an economic development loan of $300 million. So Congress said
                    that the money being appropriated to AID for $300 million was really to pay off
                    the Treasury loan. There was a political argument at the time that Treasury had
                    misused the ESF when it helped Portugal. That wasn't true. The gold collateral
                    covering the ESF had more than tripled in value and Portugal was ready to repay
                    the ESF loan on schedule. But because the number we had proposed for AID was the
                    same as the ESF number, many in Congress were extremely skeptical — putting it
                    in the friendliest terms possible — about our denial of a connection between the
                    two. I learned something there. Never make two numbers the same if they're not
                    supposed to be related. [Laughter] Congress was skeptical but they understood
                    that, somehow or other, we had to provide this help. So, holding their nose, as
                    it were, they voted for it. In fact, the Portuguese repaid the loan from the
                    Treasury for $300 million and redeemed their gold. They also paid off all of the
                    other loans. They made good on everything, so we were right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was Frank Carlucci in Lisbon as Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He was there for three years. He arrived there in February, 1975, and
                    departed in March, 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you both left Lisbon at about the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. Except that I didn't leave Lisbon, because I went from
                    Washington to Portugal as DCM in July 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that more or less take care of what I think was a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>ROWELL: If I had to add anything about that, I would say that we were handicapped
                    by the lack of national endowments for political action. The Europeans got a
                    great deal of the credit, which they deserved, for helping the democratic
                    parties. In our own way, I think, we provided help that was just as significant,
                    perhaps even more significant because of our leadership. What else did I do?
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I did want to turn to Spain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: First, let me mention that the structure of the Bureau of European
                    Affairs changed in 1975. In June the Office of Iberian Affairs was merged into
                    the Office of West European Affairs [WE]. The Director of that Office was Bob
                    Barbour. The new WE had two Deputy Directors — myself and Bill Marsh. Bill
                    managed the French and Italian side of the office, and I minded Iberia. A year
                    later Bill left on transfer and I became the sole Deputy Director of WE. In 1977
                    Bob Barbour became a Deputy Assistant Secretary for European Affairs and, after
                    some pondering by the Assistant Secretary, I succeeded Bob as Director of WE. WE
                    covered Italy, France and Malta in addition to Iberia.</p>
                <p>The changes in WE's management took place during the peak of the communist push
                    for inclusion in government in Italy and France via democratic processes. This
                    was the Euro-communist phenomenon. It drove Henry Kissinger almost to apoplexy —
                    or it seemed that way judging from some of his comments that I heard about
                    second hand. In some ways the threat in France was more significant than in
                    Italy, as the Italians had a way of getting through things without ever doing
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had a way of arranging things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: They always did. However, that kept me quite busy. There was an
                    earthquake in Italy that required US assistance. Once again...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the earthquake in the Friuli area of Italy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Once again, my old experiences with AID paid off. One day, right after
                    the earthquake, Dan Parker, the Director of AID, had to go to the White House
                    and later to make a statement on the Hill. I wrote virtually all of his
                    testimony. The AID staff had been tapped to do this, but AID didn't run programs
                    in Europe. It didn't have a corps of people who could draft papers covering the
                    political and economic side. So I wrote them and told them that I was glad to be
                    doing it because I'd always felt that State Department offices should do that
                    for other agencies. Again, that grew out of my ARA [American Republics Affairs]
                    experience. It all worked out very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a job well done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In turn, we had an excellent relationship with AID. They did a very good
                    job in terms of the master relief operations, how you shape them, and what makes
                    good sense. It made good sense in terms of providing relief. They are the
                    experts in that. We provided the expertise in terms of economic and political
                    analysis and how to work with the Italian Government. What to expect and what
                    not to expect, and what you have to protect yourself against. That was a good
                    experience.</p>
                <p>You mentioned the Spanish situation. Franco died at the end of November, 1975. We
                    finally signed the bases agreement with Spain which had delayed my arrival, At
                    the end of January 1976 — 14 months after I arrived in the Bureau of European
                    Affairs. During the 14 months I flew over to Spain periodically with Ambassador
                    Bob McKloskey's bases negotiating team. When Franco entered his final illness in
                    the late summer of 1975, the base negotiations slowed because of the effect on
                    decision making in Spain. When he died, the Spanish went through the
                    installation of King Juan Carloshat and the change of government, and then
                    signed with us very quickly.</p>
                <p>I am convinced that one of the reasons that they signed quickly was that they had
                    arrived at a decision. They already had enough problems grappling with the
                    transition from the Franco dictatorship which had been in power since the
                    Spanish Civil War [1936-1939]. They needed support from the US and Europe. They
                    wanted to enter NATO to shore up the democratic political forces. So the first
                    step was to reach a bases agreement with the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>My share of the bases negotiation was fun. The Spanish had insisted from the
                    outset that they wanted much more than a simple military arrangement. They
                    wanted a treaty (Franco was still alive) that would look more like the basic
                    NATO charter, the 1949 Treaty of Washington. This was both for public
                    presentation purposes — NATO had treated Spain under Franco as a kind of pariah
                    — and to help the Spanish military prepare themselves for eventual full
                    membership in NATO. Despite the heavy insistence on non-defense aspects, both
                    the Spanish negotiating team and ours were 90-95 percent weighted on the defense
                    elements. We were going through elaborate reviews of endless base-related
                    details, for example, on status of forces at the bases. Nobody was dealing with
                    the educational exchange program. Nobody was dealing with the scientific
                    cooperation program. Nobody was dealing with the cultural affairs program. All
                    of these were pending. So I said, “Why don't you let me do that?” So they said,
                    “Right.” [Laughter] I got OMB [White House Office of Management and Budget] to
                    agree on how much I could offer up to $45 million over a five year period in the
                    negotiations with the Spaniards. In the end I was able to wrap that side of the
                    deal up for $35 million. In truth, neither $45 nor $35 million was a whole lot
                    of money compared with the hundreds of millions on the military side of the
                    package. But I felt I had saved $10 million, and I had written a portion of the
                    agreement that in later years played a significant role in sustaining a workable
                    US-Spanish relationship. In later years we had some testy times with Spain
                    because many people who had been repressed under Franco asserted that the bases
                    agreements had helped to prop him up. I disagree, but that's what a lot of
                    people claimed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the base negotiations did you find that the real
                        negotiations were not with the Spanish but with the lawyers at the Pentagon,
                        especially on status of forces matters? Was this a problem in this
                        particular case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was, to a limited extent. The status of forces arrangements were
                    always contained in a separate agreement. We already had a status of forces
                    agreement in being. We wanted to renew it. They wanted to add some new elements.
                    We eventually resolved our differences, obviously, but it took endless haggling
                    over details. This is where the differences in our legal and social cultures
                    become painful. In the American practice everything has to be spelled out. So
                    all of our lawyers try to spell everything out, cross every “t”, dot every “i”.
                    In the European and Latin American practice and in civil law countries in
                    general there is a lot which doesn't have to be spelled out in contracts and
                    labor agreements, because the civil law covers it. It is true, however, that in
                    civil law countries, anything that isn't written down, doesn't exist as a matter
                    of law and is unenforceable. It's just that more of the writing is in the law
                    than in the contracts.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>That's the technical side of the cultural divide. The human side is even more
                    important in international agreements, because most of the time there is no
                    court to adjudicate non-performance or disputes about interpretation of a
                    treaty. International agreements work only as long as the parties want them to
                    work. If one of the parties decides that a treaty is no longer in that party's
                    interest, then it won't be observed. No amount of international appeals can
                    force it to be observed.</p>
                <p>So you get, on the one hand, some people who say, “You don't have to spell out
                    these details. We intend to observe the agreement.” Such people often resent the
                    American insistence on nailing down details. They take it as a declaration that
                    they are personally untrustworthy. On the other hand, American culture is
                    increasingly litigious and untrusting, and we know that civil law countries try
                    to have something written to cover every contingency. It's a scenario for
                    conflict. The bottom line is this: If the other country doesn't intend to
                    observe the agreement, our penchant for having all the details spelled out in a
                    treaty won't help us very much — particularly as between sovereign parties.
                    There has to be a political will to resolve the issues, if you come to a
                    disagreement or need to change something. If you don't have the political will,
                    the agreement isn't going to do it for you. That's why it is so important that
                    an agreement be freely entered into, why all sides need to be convinced it is in
                    their respective interest. That is the best guarantee an agreement will be
                    fulfilled, not the wording of the treaty. This approach applies most
                    emphatically in arrangements between friends. If the parties are hostile, then
                    the most minute details take on greater significance because of the greater risk
                    of bad faith.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, our lawyers used to drive the Spaniards up the wall with our nit-picking.
                    And the Spaniards would drive us up the wall with a sometimes cavalier approach
                    on status-of-forces issues that were really important to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in the Office of Iberian Affairs, Franco
                        was going into his last decline. From your perspective, where was Spain
                        going, as you saw it and what were you getting from the people you were
                        working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: My point of view, as a career officer and part-time political scientist,
                    was that I had the best job in the world. Here were two countries. One of them,
                    Portugal, had one kind of dictatorship and was a colonial power. It had a
                    shooting revolution, although, admittedly, there were only 12 deaths. However,
                    the armed forces were in the streets. In the other country Spain the
                    dictatorship had come to its final resting point, because the dictator was dying
                    a natural death. It would have to go through a dramatic political
                    transition.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Each of these two political transitions was different. Each was a living,
                    political science laboratory. The process was fantastic. Now, the Spanish
                    followed the transition mechanism which had been set up. I remember that, as
                    Franco was dying, I had to go through a couple of reports on what was happening.
                    People were pessimistic about the transition to a monarchy. I told them that
                    they shouldn't be pessimistic. Franco had eliminated a number of the potential
                    successors to the throne, and there was only one designated successor. I did not
                    expect rival claims to the throne.</p>
                <p>Juan Carlos, the present King of Spain, had spent his formative years going to
                    virtually every Spanish military academy. He had learned from his uncle and his
                    father, who had felt that time was running out on them and who had wanted to see
                    to the reestablishment of the throne before Franco died. Franco said, “Juan
                    Carlos, wait.” Because he had waited, some people thought that he was a
                    light-weight, ineffectual, or not serious, maybe a playboy. I thought that he
                    was smart and had bided his time because it was the only way to survive long
                    enough politically to ascend the throne. I had never met him, and the biography
                    on him in our files was the usual thing — all of the lifetime details, but
                    almost nothing about the person. But to me it was clear that here was a person
                    who had watched his uncle and his father get pushed out of contention for the
                    throne as they grew impatient, and who had known how to wait. In the meantime,
                    Juan Carlos had punched all the right tickets. I knew that when he became King
                    of Spain, he would be on a first name basis with all of the generals and
                    colonels. (My Latin American experience had taught how important such
                    relationships would be.) He had earned his office at each of Spain's military
                    institutions. When he went aboard a naval ship, he knew how to act. When he went
                    to a military base, he knew how to act. When he saw an air squadron, he knew how
                    he was supposed to operate.</p>
                <p>I was right. Moreover, Franco was right, when he designated him King. Juan Carlos
                    provided the glue which guaranteed the democratic transition in Spain. Later,
                    when I was DCM in Portugal, there was an effort, first by the “Guardia Civil”
                    [Civil Guard, a para-military police force], and then by some military elements
                    to take over the government because they thought that the Spanish Socialists
                    would wreck the country. Juan Carlos called these people on the telephone. He
                    said, “I'm your commander in chief. You know me, because we were at the Academy
                    together. You won't do this.” They obeyed him. Spain is very lucky to have him
                    as its king.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting this from the Embassy in Madrid? What did
                        you think of the reporting from the Embassy during this critical time of
                        “Whither Spain?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It was good. The Embassy was well plugged in with the opposition. When I
                    visited Spain as Deputy Director of the Office of Iberian Affairs and later as
                    Deputy Director and then Director of the Office of West European Affairs, I met
                    people on all sides in Spain. Each time I went to Spain during the bases
                    negotiations, I managed to stay an extra day and take a little time to meet some
                    people — meetings that the Embassy set up. We knew all of the chief political
                    activists. There were no surprise personalities. I Felipe Gonzalez, the
                    president of the Socialists (PSOE). I was able to make personal judgments.</p>
                <p>None of the people I met was a Marxist, in the classic sense. They were all
                    interested in a democratic structure. They were all interested in coming closer
                    to Europe and becoming a part of Western Europe. They were people with whom we
                    could feel reasonably comfortable. Many of them were hostile toward the US
                    because the bases arrangements had provided support to the Franco regime, as
                    they perceived it. These arrangements dated back to shortly after World War II
                    [1952]. So there was a lot of reserve toward the US — much more so than in
                    Portugal. We had a tough time with the post-Franco Spaniards because of that.
                    They are a very proud people. Nonetheless, we knew everybody and were able to
                    get along.</p>
                <p>We were able to continue to use Spanish facilities. These were important in terms
                    of the Middle East and in terms of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to France, when did you become involved in both
                        French and Italian affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That started around the end of 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were involved in both French and Italian affairs
                        from 1976 to 1978?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about Eurocommunism, what this
                        involved, and how we dealt with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>ROWELL: We fretted about it. [Laughter] In both France and Italy the Communist
                    strategy emphasized labor organization and winning municipal elections in the
                    first place, than national elections later so that they could enter government
                    legitimately. On the labor front they focused especially on workers in key
                    services — transport, communications, banking and finance, health, education.
                    The focus on municipal government aimed at cementing relations with the
                    electorate at the local level where people feel closest to authorities and know
                    them best. The idea was to prove that Communist mayors were good at running
                    government, delivering services honestly, effectively and efficiently. It was a
                    good strategy. Our greatest concern, of course, was that if Communists entered
                    national administrations, they would be effective Soviet tools in the heart of
                    NATO.</p>
                <p>In the case of France we had had a longstanding relationship, through the AFL/CIO
                    [American Federation of Labor/Congress of Industrial Organizations] with “Force
                    Ouvri�re” [Workers Force—FO]. This was a democratic labor structure. The
                    communists had had significant influence on French labor through the General
                    Confederation of Labor [CGT]. However, I don't think that you could really say
                    that the communists controlled the CGT. They tried to use it from time to time,
                    and succeeded on many occasions. We kept in touch with it. We talked to the CGT.
                    As for the electoral side of things, the Communist leader, Georges Marchais, was
                    so stridently Marxist-Leninist that he alienated most French voters, even the
                    ones who liked Communist administrators at the local level. The only way they
                    could arrive at the national level was through a coalition with a senior partner
                    party. That wasn't likely in the 1970s. So we watched warily, and Kissinger
                    brooded about the risk, but I wasn't too worried. French Socialist President
                    Fran�ois Mitterrand appointed some Communists to ministerial-level positions in
                    his second administration [1987-1994], but they never posed a security risk.</p>
                <p>Italy was different. From World War II to the 1990s Italy had Christian
                    Democratic leaders. One way or another, they rearranged the chairs at the table
                    of government frequently, but they never left the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Italy was very stable, in that sense. The whole situation
                        is now falling apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Now it's quite different, but for a long time it was reasonably stable.
                    But we were worried about the European communists. The term “Eurocommunists” was
                    coined with special reference to the Italians. It meant was that the Italian
                    communists were the most Western sounding set of communists in Europe. They were
                    totally different from Georges Marchais in France or �lvaro Cunhal in Portugal
                    who sounded like a Stalinist every time he talked in public. However, in Italy,
                    the communists were...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Berlinguer there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Berlinguer was the Italian communist leader, and he often appeared to be
                    an alternative to some people. The Italian communists had a strategy,
                    incidentally, based on capturing city governments and then using that for
                    regional politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which they had done in Milan, Bologna, and Naples, when I
                        was there in 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: They played the democratic game. They made a lot of money out of private
                    businesses that were very successful. These were business enterprises that
                    received their initial capitalization from the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this whole Western European area, including Spain,
                        Portugal, France, and Italy, did you notice any significant change when the
                        Carter administration came into office in 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, it didn't really change things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What the Carter administration was pushing wouldn't have
                        had much effect on Western Europe...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It had far more effect in other parts of the world. The link of our
                    operational policies to human rights performance and the presence or absence of
                    democracy didn't much apply to Western Europe and Southwestern Europe. The basic
                    orientation of our policy toward the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact didn't
                    change. Neither did our continuing support for west European integration, for
                    the European Communities, NATO, the Helsinki Process (now the Organization for
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe), and so on. So our policies and our
                    activities in Western Europe didn't change.</p>
                <p>The Carter administration was just as interested in helping Portugal to achieve a
                    decent, democratic outcome, as were the Nixon and Ford administrations. The same
                    true vis-a-vis Spain. And Secretary of State Cyrus Vance didn't like
                    Eurocommunists any more than Henry Kissinger did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with France? There is always some place where
                        France is taking a different course than the United States. They almost seem
                        to be bloody minded about this. Was there any issue during this two-year
                        period [1976-1978] where France was off on one course and we were off on
                        another?</hi>

                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Nothing that hasn't already been noticed. They had long since pulled out
                    of participation in NATO's military structure, which had been moved to Brussels.
                    They remained active in NATO's political structures, the North Atlantic Council.
                    They wanted to confine NATO strictly to “defense” issues. We had endless
                    arguments over other aspects of NATO cooperation, as in planning for the
                    “challenges of modern society”, an endeavor aimed at problems of civil
                    technology, pollution, disasters, and so on. But they still understood that the
                    Soviets were bad, and so continued to let their military participate in joint
                    exercises with us, especially in the Atlantic. There was some cooperation on
                    defense materiel. They still felt that they needed to have a significant and
                    independent role in the Middle East and in the oil kingdoms. Certainly, they
                    were concerned about what was happening in North Africa. They were determined to
                    maintain economic and commercial primacy in their former colonial areas in
                    Africa and some parts of Asia and the Caribbean. We clashed from time to time on
                    trade issues</p>

                    working his way out of that.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: I campaigned for it and then I was lucky. I knew that I needed to go

                    overseas as a DCM. At one time I had hoped to go as DCM to Madrid. The
                    Ambassador to Spain in 1978, Wells Stabler, asked me what my boss, Bob Barbour,
                    was hoping to do. Bob was scheduled for reassignment overseas from his Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary position that same summer. At the time I talked to Wells
                    Stabler, I thought that Bob had the inside track to be DCM in Paris. I mentioned
                    that to Stabler. He said, “Well, if Bob doesn't want to come to Madrid, then I
                    would like you, Ed Rowell, to be my DCM.” I thought that was fine. That
                    conversation with Ambassador Stabler was during a business trip in Madrid to
                    support the bases negotiations. I went back to Washington and recounted the
                    conversation to Bob Barbour. Bob grimaced and said, “Well, I probably should
                    have told you a little bit more about my personal plans.” He was going to Madrid
                    after all as DCM. He said he would strongly support me for the DCM slot in
                    Lisbon, for which I was a natural choice. I had been engaged in Portuguese
                    affairs since November, 1974, all of which, except for the first six months,
                    covered the post revolutionary period. I had been instrumental in shaping
                    American policy, including the assistance program, and vetting a number of the
                    other activities. I spoke Portuguese, the language of the country.</p>
                <p>We were at the point of changing Ambassadors. Frank Carlucci was about to leave
                    after three years, and Dick Bloomfield had been picked to be Chief of Mission.
                    He had been our Ambassador to Ecuador. I approached Dick, and he was favorably
                    disposed to me. In fact, when he had been going to his first mission in Ecuador,
                    1975, he invited me to go as the DCM there. However, I told him that I had just
                    broken into European affairs after 15 years' confinement in Latin America. I
                    said that, although I enjoyed Latin America, 15 years were enough to pay my debt
                    to the Department and the training program.</p>
                <p>This time (1978) Dick he wanted to offer the job as DCM in Lisbon to his DCM in
                    Quito, Ed Corr. However, Ed and the Personnel system persuaded Dick that while
                    the DCM position in Quito had been good for Ed Corr, being DCM again under the
                    same Ambassador at another post would not advance Ed's career. So Ed went on to
                    do other things and, of course, has had a distinguished career himself. He was
                    Ambassador to Peru, to Bolivia, and to El Salvador. And Dick Bloomfield then
                    invited me to go to Portugal as DCM.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1978?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Portugal when you arrived?
                        Having been dealing with Portugal, although you were not Ambassador, did you
                        have an agenda of the things that the Ambassador and the DCM were probably
                        going to have to address in Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I wouldn't describe it as my agenda, but I would say that there was a
                    clear, American agenda. Ambassador Bloomfield had arrived in March 1978 — four
                    months before I did. In a way, when I arrived in Lisbon in July, I was still
                    more fully read in on Portuguese affairs than Dick was because I had been
                    dealing with them continuously for almost four years. I knew the various
                    elements of US Government interagency activities and disagreements. I knew about
                    the strains which we had had with some NATO allies over how best to support the
                    democratic process in Portugal. I was familiar with the constant rise and fall
                    of governments in Portugal. They had a lot of governments and a lot of votes of
                    no confidence and changes. In fact, one such vote of no confidence took place
                    very shortly after I arrived, and the Socialist Prime Minister, Mario Soares,
                    was thrown out of office. A Social Democrat was inaugurated.</p>
                <p>The political turbulence had made it difficult for the Portuguese to make certain
                    changes in their fiscal management to deal with some of the problems of the
                    international environment. For example, there was the way world trade was
                    changing. We had, at the time, a substantial agricultural assistance program
                    that consisted of delivering to Portugal large quantities of both feed grains
                    and some food for humans, like fats and oils, soybeans, and also some grain. At
                    the time total US agricultural sales to Portugal were running at about $600
                    million a year. This was big business for the United States and very big
                    business for Portugal. Remember, this was during the 1970's — long before the
                    inflation which began to hit the US in 1978 and into the early 1980's.</p>
                <p>We had a substantial military assistance program. We had a lot of problems
                    getting it coordinated with our NATO allies. This was part of a total NATO
                    effort to bring Portugal out of the military structure that it had used during
                    the colonial period and into a NATO type of structure in which the Portuguese
                    could play a genuinely useful role vis-a-vis the Warsaw Pact. It also related to
                    contingencies that might have to be invoked in the event of another oil crisis
                    or some other crisis in the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>I was familiar with all of these things. I was familiar with how they were
                    planned and negotiated within NATO, and how they were justified, first at OMB
                    [Office of Management and Budget] in the US budget process, and secondly in
                    getting Congressional approval. I was familiar with the coordination between the
                    Defense and State Departments, not just on military assistance but on the
                    never-ending negotiations of our privileges at Lajes Air Base in the Azores.
                    Lajes remains today an important facility. It was a principal way station, for
                    example, when the US was transporting supplies to the Middle East for a variety
                    of contingencies and into Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>It is rather simple to explain its importance. If you take a Boeing 747 jet
                    aircraft, the kind that people fly in all the time and which is part of our
                    reserve air fleet, and you want to use it to send equipment, say, for a Persian
                    Gulf conflict, you have a choice. You can load it up with equipment and less
                    fuel, in which case it has to stop more often, or you can fill it up with fuel
                    and fly it non-stop, but without much cargo. Well, Lajes Air Base made the
                    difference. It allowed us to touch down there, refuel, and carry much more
                    cargo. When you're trying to move a lot of materiel in a hurry, you want to be
                    able to land at intermediate airports. In NATO plans Lajes Air Base was
                    significant for resupply to Europe and the ferrying of aircraft. It was also
                    important for anti-submarine patrols throughout the North Atlantic. It was a
                    constant preoccupation of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic [SACLANT]. I
                    was familiar with the details of all of those things.</p>
                <p>The trick in being DCM in Portugal was, first of all, to have a realistic view of
                    the Portuguese. They were democratic, they were going their way, they still
                    harbored certain reservations about the US, and particularly the US role in
                    Africa. They felt that the US, as the most significant of the NATO allies,
                    should have helped them more to hang onto their colonies. Of course, that was
                    something that we wouldn't do. We had refused to do it, as had the other NATO
                    allies throughout the prolonged, colonial wars. But that didn't mean that we
                    harbored designs on what had been Portuguese Africa, which is what many
                    Portuguese — though not all of them — thought or feared. So we had to deal with
                    the Portuguese on that.</p>
                <p>We had to deal with them realistically in terms of the stability of their
                    governments — when was a commitment a commitment and what kinds of commitments
                    could they not make. We needed to deal honorably with Portugal in terms of the
                    commitments which we had made in helping their military to convert to a NATO
                    force from a colonial force. So there was a lot to be done.</p>
                <p>Now, I ran into a problem with Ambassador Bloomfield. The problem was my fault,
                    which it always is when you're a DCM. [Laughter] When you're Number Two in an
                    Embassy, it's your fault. I came on too strongly. This is a classic error. I
                    tried not to. I was conscious that it was a classic error and I was trying to
                    avoid it. I recall one morning at an Embassy staff meeting. Ambassador
                    Bloomfield had returned from consultations in Washington only about a week or so
                    before. A critical question came up. I don't remember the content of the
                    question but I remember how it affected me. It dealt with a major issue of
                    policy. Every head in the room turned to me for the answer. Not a single person
                    looked to the Ambassador who had just come back from Washington, the source of
                    policy. I knew I was in trouble. Not long after that, Ambassador Bloomfield
                    called me into his office and handed me an interim efficiency report in which he
                    said that I had undermined his authority in the Embassy. He said, “Take this. I
                    don't want to talk about it now. I want you to read it, think about it, and come
                    back. We need to talk.”</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>The issue was whether I could really be a Number Two or should I start looking
                    for another job. I wanted this DCM job very badly. I knew that I could be a
                    Number Two and thought that I could turn the situation around. I persuaded him
                    that I could. It took me three months to do it. Obviously, I succeeded, because
                    I was in Portugal for a total of five years.</p>
                <p>Clearly, this had been eating at Ambassador Bloomfield for some time. That
                    morning's events had triggered the fall, as it were. On the other side, he was
                    an officer who always felt a certain degree of loyalty to his subordinates. He
                    believed, as I always had, that your job is to make your subordinates better and
                    to make them succeed, not to defenestrate them the first day that something goes
                    wrong — or even the third or the fourth day. He did that with me and for me, so
                    it eventually worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interested in the modalities as well as just the
                        events. How did you, as a DCM turn things around? You'd obviously come from
                        a place where you knew the policy and helped to develop it and so forth.
                        What was your game plan and how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Actually, it was really pretty simple. To explain it, I need to step back
                    a moment. Ambassador Bloomfield had given me enormous latitude in running the
                    Embassy. Quite a few experienced pro's commented on it, including Chief of
                    Station [director of CIA activities in an Embassy]. What had evolved was a
                    situation in which he was truly “Mr. Outside,” and I was “Mr. Inside.” People
                    who came to the DCM got answers, very often answers on the spot. I thought that
                    I had defined well enough what was internal decision making on the basis of
                    established policy, and what was a policy question which therefore had to be
                    referred to Ambassador Bloomfield. I had followed a practice of keeping him
                    informed of virtually everything that was going on, although not on absolutely
                    every detail, including telling him which things I had already given tentative
                    decisions on and which ones I was holding back for his decision.</p>
                <p>The solution to the problem really was to regard a few more issues — but not many
                    more — as policy and defer them to him for decision. And to make sure that the
                    rest of the Embassy saw that I was deferring to him. When I went into meetings
                    in the Embassy, I avoided jumping in with a proposed solution to every problem,
                    even though I had a solution in reserve in case Ambassador Bloomfield asked for
                    it. I thought that having solutions ready was part of the job. You're not a good
                    Number 2 if you just bring problems to the boss. You have to bring a game plan
                    for dealing with the problem. He might have a much better solution — or just a
                    different one. Whatever it was, unless I was helping to bring a solution, I felt
                    that I was merely part of the problem. I operated on that principle.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Ambassador Bloomfield understood my rationale. However, he said that he would
                    really like to think through his own answers to problems occasionally without
                    having me hand-feed them to him in every situation. So it was simply a matter of
                    arranging the conversation at staff meetings in a way that constantly thrust his
                    primacy and his role at everyone. I can't tell you how I did that, because it
                    was a question of sitting in the room and listening to how conversation was
                    going, interjecting myself periodically to direct people to the Ambassador.
                    Then, following up on his intervention. Partly, this involved me, because,
                    although Ambassador Bloomfield certainly had no lack of self-confidence or
                    self-respect, he didn't always thrust himself into the conversation. I simply
                    arranged to make sure that he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had to sit on your hands from time to time,
                        didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, but he was a good Ambassador. He knew the business. By the time he
                    had been there for six months he was acquainted with everything and didn't need
                    priming from me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting. Here were two professional diplomats,
                        dealing with policy problems. Could you give me a little about Ambassador
                        Bloomfield's background—where he came from and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He was a career Foreign Service Officer who came in through the
                    examination process. His first posting was in Bolivia in the early 1950's, where
                    he was the junior Economic Officer. Incidentally, my father was the DCM there at
                    the time. That may have been one reason why Ambassador Bloomfield dealt so
                    gently with me, although I don't know. Considering the degree of his discomfort,
                    he dealt with me gently, and very professionally. Frankly, I would like to think
                    that he would have done that with any DCM. He had long experience in Latin
                    America. As I said, his first mission was as Ambassador to Ecuador, where he
                    solved very difficult and long festering problems involving Gulf Oil Co. and the
                    Ecuadoran Government.</p>
                <p>His second ambassadorial mission was Portugal. He had previously served in
                    Brazil, but I had never worked with him before. I'd always known him as one of
                    the ARA [American Republics Affairs] old hands. However, I hadn't tracked his
                    career that closely. I'm sorry that I don't know much more about him.</p>
                <p>He had had a tragedy early on in his career. He had five children, and his wife
                    died when the youngest child was an infant. Later, he married a woman who had
                    been a secretary, I think, on Capitol Hill. She really raised the younger two
                    children. And, of course, she was there as his wife when we were in Lisbon. They
                    have since divorced.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, this gives us a picture. You were looking at this as a
                        professional, and we're talking about the role of the DCM at a staff
                        meeting—or was it called a Country Team Meeting then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, it would have been a Country Team Meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are the minefields of a Country Team Meeting? In a
                        way, you came from a unique perspective, having gone from EUR [Bureau of
                        European Affairs] in Washington to an EUR post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, but Portugal was different. One of the things that made me
                    instantly valuable to EUR had been my previous Latin American experience, which
                    involved intimate acquaintance with AID [Agency for International Development]
                    and with military assistance operations, both of which I'd worked with. I also
                    was comfortable in Latin cultures. When I went to Lisbon, the Mission management
                    had to put together a set of agency representatives that was outside the usual
                    EUR operations. EUR had no in-house experience and no in-house experts with both
                    of these categories of operations. The number one task of Mission management is
                    first to define the policy issues for the United States, put together the
                    different Mission elements, and get them to propose strategies and implementing
                    elements. Then we had to make sure that they stayed in synch with each other in
                    the implementation process and keep them together in terms of the debates with
                    Washington. We had to gain the support, for example, of the US Theater Commander
                    in Stuttgart on military assistance issues and the support of the US Mission to
                    NATO in terms of coordination with our NATO allies. Something comparable needed
                    to be done with the US Mission to the European Union with regard to European
                    collaboration with Portugal on its economy and its conversion to a democratic
                    structure.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: My answer to that is that when the regular efficiency report time came
                    about four months later, and he wrote the report, it was settled. The way he
                    wrote the report made it clear that this issue was settled. It also came up in
                    the discussion of the efficiency report, because the issue of the earlier mock
                    efficiency report came up once in the discussion. So I think that he was
                    comfortable with the situation.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But one has always had the feeling that Portugal was in
                        NATO first, because of the traditional link with the United Kingdom, and the
                        other, because of the Azores. One never thought of Portugal as being a
                        military power. At this time, toward the end of the 1970's, how did we view
                        our military mission to Portugal and Portugal's contribution to NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You are right that we had encouraged the other Europeans to accept
                    Portugal as a NATO ally, partly because of the Azores. In fact, substantially
                    because of the Azores, although we had managed to sustain a military base
                    relationship with Spain during all those years when Spain was in exile and not
                    allowed to join NATO, despite its repeated applications. Could you repeat your
                    question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing with the Portuguese military and, at
                        this point...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The other NATO allies and the United States had really minimized their
                    military collaboration with Portugal, because Portugal had dedicated its entire
                    military establishment to sustaining its colonial role in Africa. This,
                    incidentally, involved a very different kind of military doctrine. It meant a
                    different kind of military structure. It was heavy on people and relatively
                    light on equipment. They were fighting a guerrilla war. Heavy equipment isn't
                    that helpful in a guerrilla war, where you have to have lots of people and lots
                    of units, with heavy infantry weapons and that sort of thing. And they have to
                    be all over the area. None of that was useful to us in terms of standing, face
                    to face against the Warsaw Pact and against the Soviets. We required bases in
                    mainland Portugal and in the Azores both for controlling the Atlantic Ocean and
                    for the resupply of Europe.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese role, as we saw it, was the protection of that infrastructure and
                    some degree of support for anti-submarine patrol activities in the Atlantic
                    Ocean. The Portuguese could also make a contribution to certain, rapid reaction
                    forces. They had a good training program, they had a good commando force, and
                    they had reasonably well-trained Marines — sort of shock troops suitable for air
                    transport and rapid reaction.</p>
                <p>When the revolution came and they were out of the colonies, then our effort was
                    to enhance the training for their rapid reaction forces and significantly to
                    enhance their anti-submarine capabilities. They could make a much stronger
                    contribution in terms of anti-submarine patrol and anti-submarine warfare at the
                    gates to the Mediterranean Sea and between the Azores and Portugal. There was a
                    NATO Subcommand, called the “Iberian Atlantic Command” (IBERLANT), headquartered
                    in Portugal that was responsible for that geographic region. I think that it was
                    immediately subordinate to SACLANT [Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic at
                    Norfolk].</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>What that meant was that the Portuguese needed a new set of frigates and the
                    training and everything else that went with them. It also meant that they needed
                    substantial improvements in their Air Force, both for maritime patrol, for air
                    to surface attack, and air to sub-surface attack. They needed some improvement
                    in their air defense capability to provide some defense against the aerial
                    mining of harbors and estuaries — or an airborne or missile knockout attack
                    against port installations, both maritime and air. Then the NATO allies at
                    Ev�re, at the NATO headquarters, and, more often, at the military headquarters
                    of NATO, worked with the Portuguese on a program that would help them with this
                    upgrading, because they were fully occupied. They couldn't do it themselves.
                    They wanted to do it. Certainly, they had the basic raw material to work with in
                    terms of the literate manpower that they could recruit, as well as well trained
                    and motivated officers. It was a question of how you split up the assistance
                    tasks, the contributions that different allies were to make.</p>
                <p>This system of NATO support produced a screwball set of frigates in which the
                    Dutch and Germans helped with the hulls and the propulsion, we helped with some
                    of the anti-submarine warfare equipment, and the Canadians provided
                    communications gear, as did the Dutch. I don't know. It was called tutti fruti,
                    since there was potentially a very messy marriage of equipment provided by
                    different allies. Although they stated their contributions in cash, in fact, the
                    contributions were in kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when they were putting this together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. It was negotiated, renegotiated, and then re-renegotiated as
                    different allies wanted to give something, but their budgets were constrained,
                    and it was hard to figure out how to do it. The Portuguese couldn't buy the
                    equipment outright.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Portuguese feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Portuguese Navy people were terribly frustrated, because the
                    equipment wasn't delivered on time. It was delayed. They couldn't get their own
                    government to increase the amount of Portuguese input so that they could settle
                    some of these questions. I think that if they had paid for it, this marriage
                    would have worked. The result was that the Portuguese were always having to
                    cajole one NATO ally or another to give more. These gifts didn't fit well, and
                    the ships had to be designed, redesigned, and re-redesigned. It wasn't
                    satisfactory from anybody's point of view, but there it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>This meant that our Embassy in Lisbon was constantly working with the US military
                    authorities — the Pentagon and the U. S theater commanders at Stuttgart and at
                    Norfolk, SACEUR and SACLANT respectively; SACLANT for the anti-submarine portion
                    and SACEUR for the air defense portion and for the rapid reaction forces. Then,
                    the US, using Lisbon inputs, dealt with the allies collectively at NATO
                    Headquarters. It was a complicated coordination process.</p>
                <p>We had substantial other agency elements in the Embassy. We had AID, we had the
                    Foreign Agricultural Service [FAS], we had the Department of Commerce.
                    Obviously, we had the Department of Defense, both in the sense of the military
                    attach�s and the Military Assistance Advisory Group.</p>
                <p>One of my first difficult leadership problems came from Frank Carlucci. It was
                    only a couple of weeks after I arrived in Lisbon in 1978, and I was Charg�
                    d'Affaires — Ambassador Bloomfield was in the US. Something political had
                    happened to Prime Minister Mario Soares. Frank Carlucci, who was Deputy Director
                    of CIA, asked the newly arrived CIA Station Chief to personally deliver a
                    message from Carlucci to Soares. When the Station Chief told me what Carlucci
                    had instructed him to do, I asked what the message was. It was an innocuous
                    expression of good wishes. I told the Station Chief I would deliver it. He said
                    that first he had to check with Carlucci. Carlucci insisted that the Station
                    Chief deliver it. I sent a personal message to Carlucci via the Station Chief
                    saying that the Ambassador, and in his absence I, would deal with top officials,
                    not the Station. I would deliver the message, but the Station Chief could
                    accompany me if he and Carlucci wished. And that's what we did. So far as I'm
                    aware, neither Carlucci nor the Station Chief tried to end-run me again. When I
                    was in Washington on consultation two years later, I visited Carlucci at his CIA
                    offices and asked him why he had tried the message stunt. He and I both knew
                    that if I had acquiesced, he and the station would have had direct
                    communications with Soares without the Ambassador's knowledge. I reminded
                    Carlucci that when he was Ambassador in Lisbon he would never have let such a
                    thing happen. He laughed and said it was just a case of “where you stand depends
                    on where you sit.”</p>
                <p>Everything considered, it was a complicated Embassy. It required real management,
                    a real marriage of institutions and agencies, and careful planning.</p>
                <p>I introduced a system of mission planning that I carried with me when I became
                    Ambassador to Bolivia, elaborated again when I returned to Portugal as
                    Ambassador, and finally in Luxembourg. It was essentially like Mission Program
                    Planning, except that I introduced it in 1978, long before Mission Program
                    Planning was invented and applied on a worldwide basis. It reflected my graduate
                    business school training at Stanford and my experience in the Inspector
                    General's Office. I used a system of frequent management reviews with each of
                    the different Embassy elements to make sure they were meeting their targets.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression? Here was the first AID project
                        in Europe since the Marshall Plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, the United States had programs in Yugoslavia and some limited
                    programs elsewhere, primarily in Italy, following earthquakes and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1980 Italy had an earthquake, and our assistance was
                        AID coordinated. However, essentially, this was a real, structured AID
                        program. What was your impression of how it worked there, AID staffing, and
                        so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It worked well. AID staffing was excellent. All of the AID officers who
                    went to Portugal spoke Portuguese. Some of them had African experience,
                    incidentally, which helped in dealing with the Portuguese, because we had some
                    people on our staff who understood Africa. Virtually all of our AID people also
                    had been in Brazil at one time or another. In fact, I personally knew quite a
                    few of them from previous service in Latin America. Subsequently, when I was an
                    Ambassador, I managed to bring back one of AID people to be one of the three
                    Executive Directors of the Luso-American Development Foundation. That individual
                    is still there. They were all very competent people and knew what they were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One is always worried about a bureaucracy, which mainly
                        works in lousy places around the world, all of a sudden having a program in
                        Europe. It would be something like having a staff made up of people about to
                        be retired, and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: None of these people was almost retired. A lot of them were in their '40s
                    and maybe a couple in their 50's. These people were at the strong end of
                    mid-career or the upper end of mid-career. The fear you expressed is well
                    placed, but that's not how it worked, for the same reason that you feared. Yes,
                    how many AID people get to live in a place like Lisbon? Very few. Therefore,
                    there will be enormous competition to get there, and those with the greatest
                    clout and rank will get there. Yes, but the competition was so fierce that you
                    also got the very best people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, it worked. The current scene of bureaucracy is
                        very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>ROWELL: And the programs that they ran involved things like helping with
                    community infrastructure, because the Portuguese had to absorb something like
                    700,000 refugees from Africa when the former Portuguese colonies were set free.
                    There was food and feed grain assistance, which was essential for getting their
                    agriculture going again. There was some limited technical agricultural
                    assistance. There were housing guarantees. There was a substantial amount of
                    technical assistance in terms of business administration, both at the level of
                    universities and training Portuguese instructors who could train their own
                    business leaders. There were contracts with outfits like the International
                    Executive Service Corps which can help small businesses. We underwrote some
                    university-to-university relationships, because the Portuguese went from a
                    structure in which they had about four major universities, with some sub
                    elements equivalent to teachers' normal schools, to about 12 universities all
                    over the country. That involved a huge expansion of faculty and university type
                    infrastructure, including laboratories, classrooms, dormitories, and so forth.
                    We helped with all of that. It worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that there was an election just after you arrived
                        in Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right, just at the time I arrived. The man with whom I had
                    expected to work, Mario Soares, was suddenly relegated to a very small private
                    office in an old downtown section of Lisbon. So there was somebody else in
                    office as Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were there, how did you find
                        dealing with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It wasn't hard. You called an office and said that we need an appointment
                    to talk about whatever the subject was. You had an appointment quickly and were
                    able to go in and handle the matter.</p>
                <p>What you couldn't get was an instant answer to a proposal or question. There was
                    always a lot of internal consulting within the government. You could present an
                    issue, but then you had to prod them to pursue it. Unless it was an issue that
                    was on their front burner, they tended to relegate it to a second or third
                    echelon of some kind. Getting an answer could take days and sometimes weeks.
                    With Washington breathing down our necks, asking, “Where's the answer, where's
                    the answer?”, we would pursue it.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>What other issues did we consider with them, aside from our bilateral
                    relationship, to help them in their conversion from being a colonial power to
                    being a member of the European Community, or of Europe, and a full participant
                    in NATO? We used to talk with them about their international trade negotiations
                    — a variety of international trade negotiations. At the time Portugal was a
                    member of the European Free Trade Area [EFTA], a kind of circle of countries
                    around the European Community, most of them trying to figure out how they could
                    get in. In the meantime, they had a certain amount of trade conflict with the
                    European Community. On some trade and commodity issues we shared interests, so
                    we would talk with them about those shared interests.</p>
                <p>We dealt with the Portuguese continually on Middle East issues — on Iran, Iraq,
                    and the Persian Gulf. The Portuguese had a long trading history with Indian
                    Ocean countries and Persian Gulf powers, as well as with the littoral countries
                    around Africa. They just were there, and so we wanted to talk with them.

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Right, and then came the break in relations between the US and Iran and
                    our effort to produce pressures on Iran to release the hostage American
                    diplomats and to make the Iranians behave in a more normal way in terms of
                    international comity. We went to the Portuguese often because they had and have
                    an Embassy in Iran. They had substantial trade relationships with Iran. They
                    depended for a long time on Persian Gulf petroleum and still do. The Portuguese
                    also had some now-residual but still, at the time, strategically significant
                    mines producing titanium and uranium ore. They were marketing these commodities
                    on the international market. We were interested both in the commodity
                    arrangements and in where the commodities went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about trying to keep them away from the
                        Soviet Bloc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Right. Portugal, as a trading nation, has always been an entrepot for
                    various high tech commodities. We were interested in maintaining the quality of
                    their COCOM [Coordinating Committee on controls on East-West trade business].
                    Sometimes they did, and sometimes they didn't follow those rules. We also
                    tracked the delivery or non-delivery of weapons to the former Portuguese
                    colonies, particularly to the communist-dominated governments that had taken
                    over, certainly in Angola, which was very close to the Soviet Union and, to a
                    lesser extent, the government of Mozambique, which claimed to be close to the
                    Soviet Union but didn't operate as closely to it as Mozambique and the Soviets
                    claimed. It was a fairly active place.</p>

                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Later, when we were trying to resolve the post-colonial civil wars in
                    Angola and Mozambique, we worked with the Portuguese, as well as with the
                    Soviets, every week on that issue. There were other European countries which
                    came to be mediators. One of the important countries was Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with the Portuguese Government, say on Angola
                        and Mozambique, where they had left not long before, what did they feel
                        about the civil wars there, which were going on? Particularly in Angola,
                        which had a very strong communist element, and where there was a Cuban
                        expeditionary force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Portuguese wanted to see the Cubans out of Angola. They wanted to see
                    Angolans running Angola. They wanted a positive relationship with whoever was
                    running Angola, just so long as they were Angolans. And they wanted the civil
                    war to end so that Angola could return to prosperity. It is an incredibly rich
                    territory with enormous commercial and investor potential.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese believed, and believe to this day — and they have substantial
                    reason for so believing — that despite the period of the colonial war, which ran
                    essentially from 1961 to 1974, they had had a reasonably good relationship with
                    the indigenous peoples of Angola, Mozambique, and their other former colonies.
                    They believed that they would be accepted as businessmen, traders and investors
                    in the former colonies. The principal European language spoken in those
                    territories was Portuguese. Most Europeans don't speak Portuguese. The Italians
                    don't speak Portuguese, and neither do the Spaniards or the French. The
                    Portuguese believed that, since they were not a major world power, they
                    presented no military or overwhelming economic threat to their ex-colonies. They
                    wouldn't be able to dominate their currencies, international exchange rates, or
                    international trade in anything that they were producing.</p>
                <p>However, Portugal was a country which had amassed a reasonable degree of wealth
                    and knew how to earn its way in the world at large. They believed that their
                    membership in NATO and their relationships with the industrialized countries in
                    Europe meant that they could be instrumental in arranging for investment
                    capital, if things ever settled down. Basically, the Portuguese wanted to end
                    the civil wars, stop the fighting and get on with the business of developing the
                    former colonies economically. What they wanted out of that was a chance to be
                    shareholders in enterprises, a chance to share engineering and management with
                    Angolans who would, in fact, be the principal engineers and managers, and a
                    chance to be first among the trading nations that would be allowed to trade with
                    those territories. But as traders.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Those were and are all reasonable aims. I think that they have substantially
                    succeeded in doing this, except that investment has gone slowly because of the
                    aftermath of the civil wars. However, the Portuguese are determined to get over
                    that aftermath. There are things like land mines all over the place and some
                    unreconstructed people, both in Mozambique and Angola, who occasionally break
                    out into violence.</p>
                <p>The fact of being a small country, not seen as a major political, economic, and
                    military threat, really does ease the way for Portuguese re-entry into their
                    former colonies. As far as I can tell, the Portuguese are well accepted in
                    Angola and Mozambique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time that you're talking about, what was the
                        feeling of the Portuguese Government toward the Soviets? At one time the
                        Soviets were messing around in Mozambique. They also went into Afghanistan
                        in December, 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In the immediate post-colonial period the Soviets and their surrogates,
                    the Czechs and East Germans, messed around a great deal inside Portugal,
                    particularly between 1974 and roughly 1978. That was a time when the Portuguese
                    caught a Czech Ambassador busy paying people to push Portugal into an anti-NATO,
                    pro-Warsaw Pact role. He took money to a special clandestine meeting in northern
                    Portugal. I don't remember when that was, but it was within two years after the
                    revolution of 1974. The Soviets and Eastern Europeans were mucking around in
                    Portugal at a time when the Communists still had a lot of people planted in key
                    ministries who had access to critical documents on capital assets belonging to
                    Portuguese citizens worldwide.</p>
                <p>So the Portuguese really lost no love for the Soviets. It was demonstrated in the
                    poor performance of the Portuguese Communist Party, which kept going down, down,
                    and down in the elections. The party probably hit its apex in 1975, during an
                    election when it got perhaps 16-17% of the votes. From there on it was just
                    down, down, down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have thought that they would have had a

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, they did, but the Portuguese are a Christian, a Catholic country.
                    The Catholic Church certainly left no doubts in the mind of its followers what
                    it thought about communists and communism — which was intensely negative.
                    Certainly, Portugal's Western allies left Portugal in no doubt what they thought
                    about communism. They said, “You can't be a communist country and a member of
                    NATO at the same time.” So there was a lot of pressure, and the Portuguese
                    Communists simply didn't make it. They were beaten in the elections time after
                    time. They never came close to amassing substantial support.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: As I was saying, the Communists never came close to amassing the level of

                <p>ROWELL: The Portuguese Communist Party was unreconstructed, a hard ball,

                    for example, in Italy. There was none of that soft face.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the international scene, to go back to something that
                        you mentioned before, from 1979 until the beginning of 1981, the Carter
                        administration was terribly focused on Iran and the hostages issue. Did the
                        Portuguese play any significant role in the whole Iranian affair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, they did not. There was only one casual event when the Shah of Iran
                    had completed medical treatment in the United States at the end of the stay
                    which triggered the seizure of our Embassy in Tehran. He got a privately
                    chartered aircraft to carry him from the US to Egypt. He was quite ill. The
                    chartered aircraft had to refuel en route to Egypt. We asked the Portuguese if
                    the plane could refuel in the Azores. They gave us permission.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>The getting of the permission was personally interesting for me. I was Charg� [in
                    charge of the Embassy in the Ambassador's absence] from the country at the time.
                    I received a telegram from Washington about 8:00 PM in the evening instructing
                    me to get permission for the Shah's plane to refuel. It was a holiday eve. I
                    tracked down the Foreign Minister, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, by telephone. He was
                    on his way back to Lisbon from a trip to his home base in northern Portugal. He
                    told me to meet with him and Prime Minister S� Carneiro at the latter's
                    apartment at 11:30 PM. I did that, and we talked about an hour. I told them we
                    were determined that the Shah had to go to Egypt, he was very sick in any case,
                    and the quickest and most discreet way for him to travel was via the Azores.
                    They were worried that the new regime in Tehran might become angry with Portugal
                    if it found out the Shah had refueled in the Azores. They feared that their
                    Embassy in Tehran or their oil supplies or commercial relationships with the
                    Persian Gulf could be endangered. Freitas do Amaral and S� Carneiro withdrew to
                    another room. After about an hour they came back and told me the Shah's plane
                    could refuel in the Azores. I went back to the Embassy and sent the go-ahead
                    cable to Washington at about 3:30 AM.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pretty much the same time that you were there. Were there
                        any special events in Portugal other than this constant problem of bringing
                        the country around economically, militarily, and all of the rest that
                        occurred during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. Mario Soares — who has, incidentally, just stepped down as President
                    of Portugal, because their constitution limits Presidents to two consecutive
                    terms — was replaced as Prime Minister by S� Carneiro, a Social Democrat. During
                    the election campaign of 1980 S� Carneiro was running for President. He was
                    killed in an airplane crash. That sort of changed the political chessboard and
                    brought other people forward. It was a major issue. Nobody knew how that would
                    affect the election or whose party might win. In the end the Social Democrats
                    won the legislative elections and the office of Prime Minister. Gen Eanes won
                    his second term as President. After he completed his second term, Mario Soares,
                    a Socialist, served two terms as President.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>That was a critical event when S� Carneiro was killed. The country went into
                    exactly the same type of unending introspection as did the US after the Kennedy
                    assassination. The Portuguese themselves equated it to the Kennedy
                    assassination. They asked for technical help from the US National Transportation
                    Safety Board and the FAA to examine the remains of the aircraft, the documents,
                    and other data, to see if we could establish the reason for the crash — was it
                    mechanical failure, pilot error, conspiracy or what? There was a risk in giving
                    the Portuguese this help. The risk was that if our technicians concluded the
                    crash resulted from causes other than conspiracy, those Portuguese inclined to
                    suspect a conspiracy would say that we were part of a cover-up. Ambassador
                    Bloomfield and I totally agreed that we should provide this technical help,
                    despite the risks. S� Carneiro's government had been a coalition of Social
                    Democrats and Christian Democrats. It represented the legitimate return of
                    “conservatives” to democratic government in Portugal. The country was still
                    completing its process of post-revolution political stabilization. A conspiracy
                    would have been presumed to derive from far-left losers — in effect an effort at
                    destabilization. So, to help the political process, we needed to give the aid
                    that had been asked of us because the conspiracy theorists would otherwise never
                    believe their own authorities. They had to have some external, and presumably
                    impartial...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if you didn't do it, that would have added fuel to the
                        conspiracy theory, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The US had, and I think that it still has, in today's world, a reputation
                    for being the best in certain types of investigations. One of these is aircraft
                    transportation accidents. There is no other authority to which you can go that
                    will have the same degree of respect.</p>
                <p>There wasn't any conspiracy. We were satisfied that there wasn't any conspiracy.
                    Just the same, the conspiracy theorists are still alive and well in Portugal
                    today. I had an inquiry about it only six months ago. They just won't let go.
                    And potentially we are still part of it, even though they figure that we
                    probably had absolutely no reason to be involved in any “cover-up.” There wasn't

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that during the time you were in Portugal the
                        United States could watch the elections and developments in Portugal with
                        interest but, at the same time, in a benign way. We weren't concerned that
                        there would be a sudden shift to the Far Left.</hi>

                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>ROWELL: No. I really divide my stay in Portugal into two segments. The first was
                    from 1978 to late 1980 — say, two years. That was when we were concluding the
                    immediate, post-colonial and post-revolution period. It was the time of maximum
                    US assistance. It was when the Portuguese were concluding their first 5-year
                    presidential term under the constitution ratified early in 1976. It had been
                    drafted in 1975. With that set of presidential and legislative, Parliamentary,
                    elections, they then moved into the 1980s period of growth and transition into
                    the European Union.</p>
                <p>They concluded negotiation of their entry into the European Union in 1985. Entry
                    officially took place in 1986. That began a formal transition period — I think
                    it lasted around five years — during which they had to straighten out certain
                    critical weaknesses in their economy and bring their industry up to snuff, so
                    that they could survive in the European Union. In fact, Portugal had been
                    working on bringing its economy closer to European Community standards since
                    1980. Despite the fact that their industrial establishment was really
                    obsolescent in many respects, going into the European Union wasn't that
                    traumatic for Portugal — not nearly as traumatic as it is for today's Central
                    European countries. The reason is that the European Union, then called the
                    European Community, had always been Portugal's most significant industrial
                    customer. The principal industrial product was textiles. They also had some
                    steel fabrication, some computer equipment, some ceramics, and that sort of
                    thing. However, textiles were the major product, and, despite the tariffs
                    between the European Union and the European Free Trade Area, Portuguese textile
                    manufacturing had been competing effectively inside the European Community.</p>
                <p>So, dropping European Community trade barriers for countries coming into it like
                    Portugal presented no particular problem. They were already in the phase of
                    modernizing their textile industry in order to stay there. They had had
                    occasional conflicts with Spain on fishing rights. The Portuguese were landing
                    fish and were selling some maritime products inside the European Union. However,
                    as I say, the period from 1978 to 1980 was a period of consolidation of the
                    democratic structure of the revolution. From 1980 onwards, it was a matter of
                    preparation for entry into the European Union (EC), which would be the
                    non-military, non-defense side of total incorporation into the community of
                    democratic market economies of the industrial world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am going under the assumption that we were in favor of
                        this entry into the European Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>ROWELL: We strongly encouraged it. At the same time we acknowledged that we would
                    take real commercial hits when Portugal entered the EC. As I pointed out
                    earlier, in 1978 Portugal took over $600 million worth of agricultural
                    commodities from the United States. We were already at the stage where we were
                    hurting on agricultural commodity sales into the European Community, and the
                    picture was getting worse and worse and more difficult. So one of the
                    negotiating problems that we had during the 1980's—and, really, it climaxed
                    after I left my position as DCM in Portugal—was to negotiate the arrangements to
                    compensate us for the loss of significant Portuguese markets. When Portugal
                    entered the EC, our agricultural sales to Portugal dropped to less than $300
                    million a year — a loss of over 50%. That was real money. And there were some
                    other losses, but that was the single largest loss.</p>
                <p>We were doing other things during that period. We were selling airplanes to the
                    Portuguese airline. I had a significant role in that. We had an American
                    investment community that was thinking of Portugal as perhaps a good place to
                    invest because Portugal would go into the EC. They thought Portugal's labor
                    situation was stable and amenable. People like Ford, GM, Texas Instruments,
                    Monsanto, Digital Equipment Company, and other US firms, whose names don't come
                    to me right away, were all operating in Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were encouraging them to invest in Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We had a very strong and well-organized American business community. That
                    was due to an initiative by Ambassador Carlucci, taken shortly after he first
                    arrived, when the revolution was still going on, and American businessmen needed
                    direct, frequent, and immediate contact with the American Ambassador. He set
                    this up. So when Ambassador Bloomfield and I came along, we took advantage of
                    what was there. It was very, very good. We worked very hard to keep it intact.
                    And it's still there. We had an outstanding business relationship. We used that
                    business relationship to surface issues.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Embassy could be useful to the entire business community to
                    enhance exchanges among businessmen on helping each other — for example, on
                    labor relations, on meeting the requirements of the Portuguese investment code,
                    on problems involving double taxation between Portugal and the US. There was a
                    whole range of things. When new American investors were thinking of coming into
                    Portugal, the American business community was well enough established that we
                    were able to refer those potential investors to talk with American businessmen
                    already operating in Portugal. The businessmen had-hands on information about
                    risks and problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>I remember sitting in on a meeting where we had a new investor who was
                    encountering some problems relating to worker education that the Portuguese
                    Government had promised but wasn't delivering, and to changes in accounting that
                    were going to affect the investor's corporate tax status. Two or three of the
                    American businessmen there said, “Well, this is the way we have been handling
                    it, and it seemed to work for us. Send your accountant around to our accounting
                    department.” So they were helping each other, but the Embassy had played an
                    important role in bringing them together.</p>
                <p>We sold coal — huge quantities of coal. We were instrumental in getting the
                    Portuguese to decide to use coal in the expansion of some of their electricity
                    generating capacity. We didn't get the whole coal supply business. The
                    Portuguese prudently diversified their sources of supply.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about fishing? Did this cause us any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, we didn't have much in the way of fishing conflicts. The Portuguese
                    mainly fish for cod off the Grand Banks of the North Atlantic Ocean. Squid were
                    somewhat of a problem, but every problem we had with Portugal was minuscule
                    compared with the problems we had, say, with Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This might be a good point to stop. Were there any other
                        issues that we might talk about regarding Portugal? Oh, one point. You were
                        there when the Reagan administration entered office, a new, Republican
                        administration which came in with the emergence of the somewhat Far Right in
                        the United States. Did that cause any problems as far as our administration
                        adjusting to Portugal, or wasn't this an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Almost by accident there were some good things and some less good things.
                    The good thing was that President Reagan was determined to rearm the US and to
                    see that NATO was robust in terms of any confrontation with the Warsaw Pact.
                    That helped us in terms of support for the military assistance we were trying to
                    deliver directly from the US to Portugal and in terms of the negotiations with
                    our other allies on what they would give to Portugal. It was very important
                    help.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>In the initial Reagan White House there were a couple of advisers on the National
                    Security Council staff who had had long involvement in South Africa and, to a
                    lesser extent, in the Portuguese colonies under the pre-revolutionary
                    governments. One of these staffers had some investments and a residence in the
                    Azores. They had a lot of friends on the very conservative right end of the
                    Portuguese political and social spectrum. The Portuguese had trouble trying to
                    decipher whether the statements and writings of these individuals represented
                    President Reagan or the longstanding personal interests of these individuals.
                    Some of their statements were rather more conservative than any of the people in
                    authority in Portugal at the time. As it happened, for reasons quite unrelated
                    to Portugal, both of them had left the National Security Council staff before
                    the Reagan administration had been in office for two years. The issue simply
                    disappeared, although one of them continued to maintain private interests in the
                    Azores and occasionally visited Lisbon. This wasn't a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself trying to puzzle out what was coming
                        out of Washington and where they stood, or did you have a problem trying to
                        interpret this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, the good side of having these two people in the Reagan administration
                    was that they both really understood Portugal and the Portuguese. They certainly
                    understood the colonial situation and what was possible and wasn't possible.
                    That was the good side.</p>
                <p>The bad side was that, since all of their ties had been with the
                    pre-revolutionary authorities, they were essentially negative toward the new
                    regime, particularly toward the Portuguese Socialists who were really like West
                    European social democrats. They were a little less hostile toward the Social
                    Democratic Party and most open to the Christian Democrats as the most
                    conservative surviving political party. So they helped to feed a kind of
                    intuitive American reaction that anybody who had the word Socialist in the label
                    was clearly bad. It was ironic because the Socialists in Portugal, particularly
                    under Mario Soares, had three times made difficult fiscal decisions to tamp down
                    inflation, maintain a decent balance of payments, and an economic environment
                    that would justify more foreign investments. They had paid the price three times
                    in elections and were thrown out of government each time. Those who had opened
                    the spigots to win elections had been the Social Democrats, the so-called
                    conservatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, everyone can say the same thing about the
                        Reagan administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It was ironic because, at times, American businessmen would arrive in
                    Portugal and say, “Well, thank God, you have the Social Democrats now.” I might
                    say, “Wait a minute. Remember, you were worried about inflation. The guys who
                    'turned it off' were the guys now on the 'outs,' the Socialists. I'm not
                    advocating one party or the other. I just want you to understand how these
                    people behave when they're in power, so that, when you're making a business
                    decision, you can project the kind of environment you think that you're going to
                    be working with afterwards.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we leave it at that? If there's anything more that
                        you want to add about Portugal, we can pick it up the next time. I think
                        that we've covered it. In 1983 you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Back to the Department of State to become principal Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we'll pick it up at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>—Q: Today is February 27, 1996. Ed, let's talk about your time when you came to
                    Consular Affairs. First of all, you were Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    for Consular Affairs from when to when?</p>
                <p>ROWELL: Technically, from October, 1983, to about July, 1985. I say
                    “technically,” because I had been selected and proposed for this position when I
                    came back from Lisbon in July 1983. I took a little home leave in California,
                    and went to Washington. The political process for getting White House consent
                    for Deputy Assistant Secretary appointments was slow and sticky. It took four
                    months to complete.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do during those four months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I sat in the office, I familiarized myself with problems in Consular
                    Affairs, thought about a couple of major things that needed doing, and visited a
                    couple of passport agencies since I hadn't seen passport operations since my
                    first year in the Foreign Service in 1956. I worked with a management studies
                    group within the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an old consular officer who always tried to examine
                        things, tell me how you looked upon this assignment in Consular Affairs
                        because the mind set of many Foreign Service Officers is, “If I'm not in a
                        geographic bureau or the Executive Secretariat, I'm out of the mainstream.”
                        You had been a DCM, after all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I liked it. Obviously, sometimes one's likes are shaped by circumstances.
                    Clearly, I still harbored hopes of becoming a Chief of Mission. It's always hard
                    to get a good onward assignment. A good senior assignment is even harder, even
                    though one may have a good reputation in the Foreign Service. The positions are
                    fewer, those competing for them are all very good, and there aren't any
                    dunderheads. You have to be a little bit lucky. Your timing has to be right.</p>
                <p>I had been in Lisbon for five years. I had spent the year before I returned to
                    Washington, hunting around for a job, but nothing terribly promising had come
                    up. The Department had slated me for the Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. Then, just before I left Lisbon, the then- Assistant Secretary for
                    Consular Affairs, Diego Asencio, called me and asked if I would be interested in
                    becoming his senior deputy. Another officer, Bob Fritts, who had been in the job
                    and whom Diego had asked to remain there, had received an appointment as
                    Ambassador to an African country. So suddenly, Diego didn't have anybody for
                    that job. I understand that there was one other person he had gone to. That
                    person wasn't available, so he came to me.</p>
                <p>I thought the matter over for 24 hours. The best job in a bureau in Washington,
                    not counting the Assistant Secretary who heads the bureau, is to be a Principal
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS). The Principal DAS becomes the alter ego for
                    the Assistant Secretary when the Assistant Secretary is away. The Principal DAS
                    has a lot more sway than any of the other Deputy Assistant Secretaries in a
                    bureau. The others tend to have more narrowly defined responsibilities: in a
                    geographic bureau for a more limited, geographic area; in a functional bureau,
                    for a more limited, functional area.</p>
                <p>In the Bureau of Consular Affairs, in addition to myself, there was a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Visa Operations, a Deputy for Passports, and a Deputy
                    for American Citizen Services. I covered the whole sweep of the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>The other thing is that I have always enjoyed functional bureaus as a refreshing
                    change from geographic bureaus. The daily play of bilateral relations or the
                    relations among a set of countries becomes old hat after a while. One sees the
                    same kinds of problems coming back again and again. Shifting to a functional
                    bureau provides relief from the bilateral patterns. One of the exciting things
                    about the Foreign Service as a career is that you get a chance to change
                    problems and tackle something new. This is stimulating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly had an awfully long time on the problems of
                        Western Europe—particularly the Iberian peninsula by that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. By that time I had spent nine years dealing with Western
                    Europe and certainly with Portugal for the whole nine years. I was ready to go
                    into something else. A last minute possibility of a junior DAS position in
                    American Republics Affairs arose, but I took the job in Consular Affairs and
                    enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>Now, the person who had recruited me, Diego Asencio, meantime had received an
                    appointment to go as Ambassador to Brazil. He was succeeded by Joan Clark, who
                    telephoned me while I was on home leave in California and asked if I would be
                    willing to continue as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    State-Designate (and Principal Deputy when the White House got around to making
                    up its mind).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always like to talk a bit about the persons you worked
                        for, first. In a way, Joan Clark had a difficult act to follow, because
                        Diego Asencio was one of these expansive personalities with interests all
                        over the place who had a certain zest for bureaucratic work and also for
                        dealing with Congress. Correct me if you saw a different picture. Joan Clark
                        was sort of the archetypical, consummate bureaucrat. They were two, quite
                        different personalities. How did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I didn't really work for Diego Asencio. I had an interview with him and
                    with his senior staff. It was an old boy club. As you say, Diego was the
                    quintessential extrovert — a personality with rotund presence. However, since I
                    didn't work with him, I can't really comment on what it felt like to be with him
                    for any prolonged period. I had never worked for him at any other time.</p>
                <p>Yes, Joan Clark is the quintessential “bureaucrat”, although the word that came
                    to my mind was the quintessential inside manager. She is a much quieter, more
                    reserved personality than Diego Asencio. She delegated substantial authority to
                    me and treated me the way a Deputy Chief of Mission is treated at a major
                    Embassy. She gave me essentially all of the responsibility that I asked for. She
                    regarded her job as watching the external, political side of Consular Affairs.
                    She thought that it was important to help the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary
                    to understand when a consular issue could cause them problems, to tell them what
                    was being done about it and how to deal with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>One of the consular issues that was a true lightning rod at the time was the
                    implosion of the passport agencies around the country. Demand for passports had
                    surged. I don't remember the reasons, but in percentage terms it far exceeded
                    anything that we anticipated. There were huge lines outside the passport
                    agencies. They were calling in extra police patrols to keep the lines in order.
                    Frustrated passport applicants rioted in New York and Chicago. The staffs of the
                    agencies were at the bottom of the Civil Service pay scale — GS-1's and GS-2's.
                    The counter clerks were a little higher — GS-5's. However, they hadn't been
                    hired to be stellar public personalities, and that came through to the public as
                    well. The passport situation was drawing Congressional hearings, complaints, and
                    special surveys. I don't recall, but I wouldn't be surprised if the General
                    Accounting Office was looking around as well. So that was a major, political
                    problem for the Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>This was in addition to the usual problems. The processing of visas often
                    involves at least 50% service to persons already resident in the US — generally,
                    family members. It is as much that as it is anything else. Those resident family
                    members often have the ear of their Congressional representatives. Congressmen
                    and their staffs regard chivvying the consular operation as one of the easiest
                    constituent services, to make it look as though they produced the service all by
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I wanted to change was the established pattern for
                    computerizing passport issuance. The Consular Bureau was in the process of
                    installing mini computers. Now, the mini computers were not “mini” by today's
                    standards. A mini computer of that time typically occupied a room that was 8' x
                    10' x 8'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the early 1980's generation of computers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was worse. This was being done in 1983. They had started the
                    installation process maybe four years before, but it was essentially a 1974
                    design, using 1975 technology. They hadn't changed the technology. They were
                    simply plodding along, installing these things as they got the money, which
                    meant one or two a year. The design meant that they had to make major structural
                    changes in the passport agencies to provide properly conditioned air. The cost
                    was averaging between $1.5 and $2.0 million per installation. PC's...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Personal Computers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Personal Computers had already been invented and were being sold. Memory
                    capacity had soared and occupied much less space. I asked Joan if I could take
                    the short computer course for executives which the Department of Defense is
                    famous for. I took it and learned enough to launch myself into a major overhaul
                    of that particular computerization operation. I wasn't yet thinking of one
                    single passport center, such as we have now, but primarily in terms of making
                    these computer installations cheap enough so that we could replicate them and
                    substantially boost efficiency at the passport agencies — with a system that
                    also could be installed overseas. I say “could be” because the idea was that the
                    installation cost would be low enough to be cost effective even at places that
                    might issue only 5-10,000 passports per year.</p>
                <p>I pushed a contract with a local Washington, DC firm to show us how we could use
                    personal computers and a local server and memory device to replicate the
                    passport issuance line. It took about a year — perhaps 15 or 16 months — to get
                    a trial operation up and running in the Philadelphia Passport Agency. It cost
                    about $750,000, which was just about what I had estimated that it would cost.
                    The bidders had come in at $300,000 when they offered a contract. However, I had
                    learned enough at the Defense Department course to apply some rules of thumb for
                    computerization cost estimates. They were right on the mark. So in our internal
                    budgeting, when we decided whether we were going to try this system, we were
                    honest with ourselves about what we expected the real cost to be.</p>
                <p>The system worked. There were two major problems because we asked the contractor
                    to use off-the-shelf software, which shortened the application development time.
                    When you get off-the- shelf software for a special application as in the
                    passport case, invariably it has to be modified to some extent. One of the
                    problems with the old system that I wanted to displace was that, because it was
                    being installed so slowly, the contractor doing it had two people whose sole
                    function was to support the software and the installations. The number of years
                    during which the installations were going ahead meant that the software was
                    substantially modified for each new installation, so that each installation had
                    its own software package. Theoretically, this was all documented, but the
                    contractor was three or four years late in providing the documentation. That
                    meant that if there were one traffic accident, we would be wiped out. All we had
                    to do was lose that key employee of the contractor. Theoretically, he had a back
                    up, but the back up didn't know nearly as much. He was a trainee. And the
                    documentation was not available. It was scary. That was another reason why I
                    wanted to get rid of that and go on a standard system that would be much
                    simpler.</p>
                <p>Other advantages of the personal computers was that they didn't require air
                    conditioning and they took much less space. The volume of space they require is
                    broken up, also. If you take the space for a block of machinery that's 8' x 10'
                    x 8', and then break that down into the space needed for a typewriter, you all
                    kinds of different space configurations suddenly become possible. It's a huge
                    boost in flexibility and, therefore, adaptability to many different kinds of
                    sites.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Anyhow we got it. We had a pilot test. The pilot test worked. The major
                    difficulties were some weaknesses in the software that made back-up and
                    searching for names unnecessarily long. It took about two or three months to get
                    those bugs worked out.</p>
                <p>A second major problem was how to create an interface with the archaic computer
                    storage systems in the Department of State. The passport agencies were clearing
                    the names of passport applicants through a central file at the Department of
                    State to make sure that the applicants didn't owe the Department money on old
                    repatriation loans and to make sure that there wasn't a look out notice on them
                    on some criminal charge. The main computer at State, the communications links to
                    it, and the software handling the main-frame name searches in Washington were
                    very old. They operated through a kind of teletype interface. So the software
                    designers for the new agency had to figure out some way to simulate
                    electronically the signals of a prehistoric teletype machine so that the
                    computer at the Department of State in Washington would be able to understand
                    what was coming in. This meant that it would involve very slow transmission of
                    data and a very slow reply. Eventually, they did it, but it was a jury-rigged
                    solution.</p>
                <p>The bottom line was that we spent $750,000 for the software and an initial set of
                    computers. Once the pilot test was working well at Philadelphia, it was possible
                    to replicate the system for a small installation—one that would issue, perhaps,
                    5,000-10,000 passports a year — for, we estimated, $25,000-$40,000. This was a
                    price range that would make it possible for us to do it overseas. We never did
                    it overseas. We never got around to it, but that's another issue. The concept
                    was there, and we made it work.</p>
                <p>What we then ran into, and this was happening when I was getting ready to leave
                    Consular Affairs two years later, was a drive to consolidate passport issuance
                    in one or more major centers in low wage areas of the United States. At the time
                    that I left they were looking at some place in Kentucky. Now it's in New
                    Hampshire. The idea was to create giant processing centers. They now have
                    started this for visas, but we first talked about it for passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, were there any attempts to make
                        the passports, which had their own, internal code in them, available to INS
                        [Immigration and Naturalization Service], so that we were all working with
                        the same equipment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The answer is, “Yes. Sure.” In fact, we consulted extensively with the
                    INS and with the Bureau of Customs on passport design, including machine
                    readability. We had joint conferences. At one time, I think, there was a joint
                    task force.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>There were lots of problems. One was the Optical Character Reader [OCR] which
                    would allow a machine to read a typed line. They were not nearly as well
                    developed as they are today. The OCR's were inclined to misread or simply to
                    blank out a passage if they had a little bit of difficulty with a smudge, for
                    example. I wanted to use a bar code system in the passports for all of the
                    essential machine-readable data. And then to print next to the bar code whatever
                    the data were — similar to the way you see things on a grocery store shelf. You
                    have the bar code and, under it, a number. That tells the machine what's going
                    on. I was too late in pushing that notion, when I arrived in Consular Affairs.
                    The lawyers and, I think, maybe some public affairs people and Congressional
                    liaison people, had convinced everyone that you had to have plain text only so
                    that the bearers of the passports could not claim they might contain hidden
                    information about the bearer. As a result we had to “rely” on still-developing,
                    sensitive and dyspeptic Optical Character Readers. I still think that was the
                    wrong decision, but I was voted down. Had they gone to the bar code, they would
                    have had a much faster and proven technology that they could have applied
                    immediately and at a fraction of the cost that they eventually had to pay. This
                    cost still doesn't pay off completely, because other countries that promised to
                    use the same technology to speed the arrival and departure of their citizens
                    here and ours there still are not using the Optical Character Readers
                    universally.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the answer is, “Yes,” we did work very, very closely with Customs and
                    with INS on this project. There was a lot of cooperation between these different
                    agencies. Customs and INS were both buying Optical Character Readers on a trial
                    basis for scanning the machine readable information on the passports. However,
                    when I left Consular Affairs they hadn't gotten to the point where they were
                    using them on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that it would be interesting to explore this a bit
                        further. Did you find a discrepancy between the various parts of the
                        Department of State as far as automation is concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I did and I still do. The Department of State has gone through all of the
                    classical phases of automation. The first thing that happens with automation is
                    that people take processes as they exist and try to mechanize them
                    electronically. They don't re-think the processes. In some processes, for
                    example, many of the intermediate products are there because that's the only way
                    that you could keep the process reliable in a manual operation. However, with
                    electronic machinery sometimes you can eliminate quite a few steps and do things
                    differently. It's always good to review the entire concept, in effect, review
                    the mission statement or element and say, “What is it that we're really trying
                    to produce? How do we know it's been produced?” And re-think the inputs — a sort
                    of management review, which ought to take place at least every five years in
                    every element in any case.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Then different elements of the Department of State would have different degrees
                    of budget problems. There also was a central computer management service in the
                    Department of State that always seemed to be starting things or re-thinking
                    things and always trying to get its hand on the management of the entire State
                    Department computer system. Because of the budget problems, even a concept was
                    up to date when it was approved, by the time a system was installed in a bureau
                    or major functional office, it was seriously obsolescent and often out of synch
                    (that is, unable to interface well) with installations in other bureaus or at
                    overseas posts.</p>
                <p>Bureaus would go for computer systems on their own as funds became available. CA
                    [Consular Affairs] did that. It could get away with it, despite occasional
                    protests and sniping from State's central systems people, because budgeting for
                    Consular Affairs is separate and unique within the Department of State; and
                    because the CA processes (visas, passports, citizen services) were functionally
                    unique in State and world-wide in scope. CA has its own line item in the budget
                    for the State Department. Consular Affairs could therefore come up with
                    resources for computerization that other bureaus in the State Department
                    couldn't match. The central computer people couldn't handle it CA's scale of
                    needs. They had to take care of the bulk of the Department of State. In effect,
                    what they did was to provide a liaison arrangement and say, “All right, Consular
                    Affairs, do your thing. Anyhow, nobody else is going to be dealing with
                    passports and visas, so you're not complicating the whole world for the rest of
                    the Department.”</p>
                <p>The Department of State had its main computer contract with Wang. Wang turned out
                    to be a weak company because it depended on the man who created it. He didn't
                    install a second and third generation in the company that could make it hum as
                    well as he had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you took this job, were the passport lines somewhat
                        in order by the time you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. The problems had been virtually cured by the time I left Consular
                    Affairs. The rate of increase in demand for passports had relatively declined,
                    although the demand was still rising. It was easier to catch up. We poured
                    substantial resources into several agencies and retrained people. We opened a
                    couple of special passport processing centers. These were the forebears of the
                    major center that's now in Portsmouth, NH. For example, in New York we went into
                    a warehouse. I've forgotten where it was in metropolitan New York — whether it
                    was in lower Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens. There was a huge amount of space in
                    this warehouse—a much lower cost per square foot Rockefeller Center where our
                    main agency had been for years. We simply produced all of the passports required
                    in the New York area in the warehouse space.</p>
                <p>I think that we did that in one other city, too, although at this time I don't
                    remember. There were a couple of new passport agencies opened. In any case, yes,
                    it got much better.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, at this time, that the passport agency which
                        had a long career—about 60 years under two ladies, practically, Frances
                        Knight and Ruth (I can't think of her name right now). Did you find that the
                        passport agency, by the time that you arrived in Consular Affairs was really
                        an integrated part of the Bureau of Consular Affairs and of the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. Because by the time I got there, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Passports was a career State Department employee. In fact, both of the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries for Passports who were there while I was there were
                    Foreign Service Officers. So that the political position in Consular Affairs was
                    the Assistant Secretary. None of the deputy positions was as political as the
                    Assistant Secretary. That took care of that problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It came back later on. Some of the political process moved
                        back into the passport operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, that's right. You can always bring in another Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, but the kind of relationship that had existed between some of the
                    long serving, old Baronesses — they were all women — and particular
                    Congressional sponsors never recurred in the same way. The people appointed from
                    outside the government to head the Passport Office, when this happened again,
                    were essentially people watched by the White House Appointments Office. None of
                    the White House administrations was interested in creating a new, independent
                    operator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the consular service? Your position was
                        such that you took a look at Consular Officers. Many of them had their own
                        morale or esprit, or lack thereof—something like that. This waxes and wanes.
                        During the period that you were there—1983 to 1985—what was your impression
                        of the Consular Cone or the American Consular Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Consular Officers varied. There were a lot of superb Consular
                    Officers. I had one assigned to our office as the senior staff assistant for the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs — Max Robinson. He was just an extraordinarily
                    competent person. I encouraged him to do a number of things. I think he is an
                    Ambassador by now. He later went to Soviet Affairs, which had a major,
                    sub-operation in the Bureau of European Affairs. It dealt only with consular
                    problems, such as the so-called refuseniks. He later went as Consul General,
                    first to Moscow and then to Leningrad [now St. Petersburg] as Consul General and
                    Principal Officer. He has come back to the Department. He has been Deputy
                    Executive Secretary of the Department. I don't remember where he is now, but
                    he's an Ambassador—and he should be. He is just a wonderfully gifted
                    officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>The other senior Consular Officers I have known all knew their business extremely
                    well. They were very competent, from my point of view. You used the term,
                    “Consular Corps.” My mind has always rejected the notion of a separation between
                    consular and diplomatic corps. We are all career Foreign Service. We are all
                    available on a worldwide basis. Although we have specializations, we all have a
                    core of general skills and general experience. We're supposed to be able to
                    cover for each other in a lot of places and times and in a lot of ways. I have
                    never felt comfortable with the notion that there should be some kind of class
                    of officers who only do visas, passports, or citizen protection work — who can
                    only serve in a Consulate, and therefore require some kind of separate
                    designation to protect their careers and their self esteem.</p>
                <p>However, I am paddling up a very swift stream. [Laughter] It's a view which, I
                    think, is not as widely shared as it should be. When I approached issues of
                    career for those persons who had chosen a consular specialization, I ran into
                    the Consular Officers Association, which was extremely defensive and
                    hyperprotective. For example, I looked at the position structure for Consular
                    Officers. It is a very low building, with one flagpole in the center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about looking at the personnel pyramid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Except that it's not a pyramid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I mean that there are a lot of junior
                        officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: A lot of very junior officers in relatively low graded positions. Then,
                    once you get toward the upper middle grades, say, FSO-2, FSO-1 and above, it's a
                    very narrow structure. This told me that you had to have huge numbers of people
                    doing consular work at the beginning of their careers who didn't intend to
                    continue as Consular Officers and who would probably resent, even more, the
                    drudgery and often emotionally numbing effect of a lot of consular work. They
                    would climb out of the visa mills and never want to go back and never think
                    kindly of people who elected to stay in consular work. These people hadn't liked
                    consular work and hadn't experienced the more stimulating parts of it — just the
                    nasty parts of it. So you always had junior officers who probably weren't able
                    to give you their best in this kind of job, because of the stresses
                    involved.</p>
                <p>I thought we should figure out a way to staff a lot of those junior consular,
                    visa, positions in some other way. I have gone through that war several times
                    and still go through it. You could reduce the total number of Consular Officers,
                    essentially by reducing the number at the junior levels, but not at the
                    mid-career, senior levels. You still have to have experienced, professional
                    Consular Officers managing it. Then the promotion opportunities for those who
                    chose the consular function would be much better. As individuals, they could
                    expect to receive the recognition that they deserve. They don't get enough
                    recognition.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I've always thought that Consular Officers were their own worst enemies in this
                    regard. There's too much whining. They tend to feel that if you allow family
                    members to have temporary commissions to do some of the ordinary humdrum work,
                    like taking notarials, doing some initial screening of visa applicants, taking
                    passport applications, or, in some cases, visiting incarcerated or hospitalized
                    American citizens overseas, this was taking away a critical part of their
                    functions. If you allowed somebody who didn't have a full blown commission to do
                    that, it meant that the commission didn't have value. I never saw it that way
                    because I thought that they had Foreign Service commissions that allowed them to
                    do a lot of things. And I knew enough Consular Officers who could do those other
                    things and do them well. I gave them a chance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll tell you, there's a different perspective, and, as an
                        old consular hand, I'll just put it in. I think that part of the
                        defensiveness about this function was due to a lack of respect for the
                        system, because the system would say, “Okay, these people, particularly
                        wives and other family members would be brought in at this level and
                        wouldn't stay on.” However, the old Consular Service—and I'm talking about
                        the Consular Service from the 1950's and 1960's, when I served in
                        Personnel—would give these people temporary commissions and then couldn't
                        get rid of them. The wives or other family members liked what they were
                        doing. After someone's spouse had been doing semi-consular work for a while,
                        they were allowed to get a regular commission. Nobody was going to say,
                        “No.” Pretty soon, people like this started to move up. Compared to regular
                        Foreign Service Officers, these people were not of the same caliber. They
                        tended to move into the mid ranks and poisoned the well. This was an example
                        of bureaucratic creep, you might say. This was the problem that some of us
                        Consular Officers saw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: But none of the persons that I spoke with put it as lucidly as you have,
                    just now. I still think that there are counter arguments. This interview isn't
                    the place to go into them. However, what I can say about this whole process,
                    because I pushed very hard to try to get them to change their minds, is that in
                    the mid 1980's the Department of State was encountering a problem which is still
                    acute and still has no good solution for it. The issue is what do you do with
                    spouses who are professionally qualified? This is not a problem unique to the
                    Foreign Service, the Department of State, or the United States Government. I
                    have run into exactly the same problem in conversations with university
                    presidents, who discover that they cannot recruit a Nobel Prize winner for the
                    Physics Department unless they can find a decent professorial appointment for
                    the physicist's spouse, who may be an historian. Universities lose when they
                    can't do both.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I've heard something similar, although much less severe, from private industry.
                    This is simply a late 20th century problem for Americans. We're already clear
                    that it was there in the 1980's in a way that it was not in the 1950's and
                    1960's. What it means is that the system, the institution, has to adjust itself
                    to the society that is providing its people and to meet the changes in
                    population at large.</p>
                <p>However, in any case, I had this notion. Joan Clark, who has been around a long
                    time, thought that I was spitting into the wind. However, she let me push the
                    issue as hard and as much as I wanted. She trusted me not to blow up the Bureau
                    of Consular Affairs in the process. I pushed it seriously but gently among the
                    senior career Consular Officers within the Bureau and with visiting Consuls
                    General when they came back from overseas. I got nowhere and left Consular
                    Affairs frustrated on that issue. I still think that we could have made some
                    changes that would have redounded both to enhanced reputation and to enhanced
                    careers and promotions for Consular Officers.</p>
                <p>I want to take up another element of the service in Consular Affairs. Some of the
                    nastier problems that we had to deal with were almost always politically
                    sensitive. They involved visas. There are always bad people applying for visas.
                    However, there are often good people applying for good reasons which our overly
                    complicated laws and regulations fail to recognize properly. We have
                    administrative patterns that people cling to and, in doing so, make them rigid.
                    A certain amount of good judgment needs to be applied.</p>
                <p>You know, if a rule could always be applied, exactly as written, and required no
                    judgment, we would require no people. A machine can apply a straightforward rule
                    — absolutely, accurately, and rigidly, every time somebody touches the rule. The
                    reason that we have people is because we have to exercise judgment.</p>
                <p>What I would run into — I'll give you one situation. General Motors and Toyota
                    built an automobile assembly plant at Fremont, California, on an exactly 50-50
                    basis. Toyota provided technical management, and General Motors provided some
                    wider managerial and financial oversight. The plant produced both GM cars and
                    Toyota Corollas. It still does. The visa regulations allowed foreign executives
                    to come into the United States to manage a business in which, at the time, the
                    foreigners have over 50% of the investment. In this case the plant was a 50-50
                    split, and the Japanese therefore didn't have over 50% of the investment.
                    Therefore, Toyota was having an impossible time getting its executives into the
                    US for this plant. The reason that GM had entered into this deal with Toyota was
                    to acquire a certain amount of technical know how in assembly efficiency from
                    the Japanese, who were taking GM to the cleaners in the marketplace.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>So I looked into the matter. I asked the Visa Office people why the visa
                    regulations said that the foreign investment had to be more than 50% for the
                    investor's executives to be able to enter freely. The Visa Office people said
                    the law required it. I said, “All right, show me the law.” I had a brief from
                    one of the legal people in the Visa Office, who referred to the law. He showed
                    me the law. The law didn't say anything about 50%. It only gave general
                    guidance. I said, “I don't see this in the law.” I was told, “Well, it's in the
                    regulations.” I said, “Show me the regulations.” The regulation was as he said.
                    I said, “Well, this doesn't make sense. The way the law reads, you could easily
                    give these executive visas to employees of any foreign company which has a 50%
                    interest. It doesn't have to be more than 50%.”</p>
                <p>I'm simplifying this somewhat to give you the picture. I said, “You've written
                    the regulations to state more than 50%, but the law doesn't require that. So
                    let's change the regulations and issue these visas.” The Visa Office paralegal,
                    a senior civil servant, said, “Well, you can't do that. The Congress won't allow
                    it.” I said, “How do you know that the Congress won't allow it?” He said, “Well,
                    we cleared this regulation with them when it was issued.” I said, “When was it
                    issued?” He said, “Oh, 15 years ago.” I said, “Fine, are there any Congressmen
                    left who remember it?” [Laughter] So I said, “Change the regulations.” They
                    didn't want to change the regulations. The Visa Office felt that, somehow or
                    other, that was a very bad idea. I told them that they would have to change the
                    regulation. Then I directed our Congressional liaison people to sound out the
                    staffs in the appropriate committees, explaining why I wanted to change the
                    regulation. Much to the chagrin of the people in the Visa Office, the
                    Congressional staffs came back and said, “Right. Get on with it. Let's 'save'
                    GM.”</p>
                <p>So then we had to go through the publication process concerning changes in the
                    regulations. It took about six months. We changed the regulations and issued the
                    visas. I'm glad that we got the regulations changed. I concluded, though, that
                    there is something in our system that deadens people who work in visa mills on
                    visa problems all of their working lives to the need to lift your head, search
                    the horizon, and understand how things change. Maybe they need to re-think some
                    of the rules, or rethink the way we use our employees.</p>
                <p>Every year we have in our authorization bill proposals for changes in the laws.
                    Every year the Bureau of Consular Affairs will come up with anywhere from five
                    to 15 elements of law that need to be adjusted to make things work better. The
                    ones that have good justifications are almost always approved by Congress. This
                    isn't a big deal. The Bureau of Consular Affairs has so much experience in this
                    that I was shocked that they wouldn't say, “Right, let's change the
                    regulation.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never was a visa expert. In a way maybe this reflects
                        it, but I found that, as a Supervisory Consular Officer, one of my major
                        concerns was not so much not having top caliber people making visa judgments
                        as that they tend to stick exclusively to the law and to learn the law,
                        rather than to use common sense. Often, common sense tells you, “Oh, for
                        God's sake, go ahead and issue the visa,” if there is some judgment
                        involved. The less imaginative people, I think, often take refuge in the law
                        and particularly in the regulations. That's what they learned, and that's
                        how they operate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. For some of them, and this was particularly true of some of
                    the people who were permanent staff in some of the Washington offices, these
                    regulations become their personal children. Psychologically, they want to
                    protect these regulations because they embody their own self-esteem and
                    personality. Their unique contribution is their ability to interpret their
                    children — the regulations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a matter of power, too, on the Protection and Welfare
                        side of the consular function, what we call American services. This really
                        involves the problems of American citizens overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I'm going to come to that in a minute, but there's one other thing that I
                    would like to mention. We've just been citing some of the negative sides of visa
                    work. I want to mention a couple of good things.</p>
                <p>First of all, I found Foreign Service Officers who were working on visas and who
                    had been overseas were always trying to think of ways to do it better, to be
                    humane in treating applicants, to be more efficient, to reduce costs, and the
                    whole works. We had constant experiments going on in different Consulates and
                    Consulates General around the world with physical and processing rearrangements.
                    There was an enormous and fruitful process of effervescence that was going on
                    there. These were serious people. They came up with a lot of good ideas. We
                    wouldn't be doing the volume of business we're doing today, with the funding
                    that we have today, if it were not for the imagination and the energy that these
                    supervisory consular managers were putting into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that it's one of the fun things in the consular
                        business. In many ways it's almost the one place where you can exercise
                        management on the ground and try out ideas. Whereas in the field of foreign
                        relations in general, it's a different mindset. This is for the active
                        person.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right, but I never found, in any of my overseas postings, a
                    Supervisory Consular Officer who didn't have some sense of the potential
                    political and public affairs implications of visa decisions and the visa
                    processing system at his or her post. They always understood that things could
                    go extremely well or very badly for the post, depending on how they managed
                    their area of responsibility. I can tell you that when I was a DCM, I was
                    certainly aware of this consideration. My sensitivity had been raised by my
                    first assignments, which were at consulates. These Supervisory Consular Officers
                    understood this point better than some of the Political Officers. The Political
                    Officers should have understood it better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if you're dealing with the problem. Should we move
                        to the Protection and Welfare problems of Americans overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I want to put on the record that I'm speaking as a person who was coned
                    as a Political Officer, although I spent at least two or three tours as an
                    Economic Officer. And, of course, my first couple of tours were as a Consular
                    Officer. All right, let's go to American Services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way we've got a problem on our plates today. Some
                        Cuban-Americans were shot down over Cuba. In a way, it's a big political
                        issue but, when you boil it down, it's a consular problem, when American
                        citizens get into trouble. Often our resources for dealing with problems of
                        this kind are minimal in working with other governments. How did you find it
                        during this 1983-1985 period? Were there any major problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I don't recall anything really splashy, but there were always problems.
                    For example, 1983-1985 was a period during which we were trying to launch the
                    whole series of bilateral agreements that we now have for mutual help on child
                    abduction. This typically involves parents who are splitting up in one way or
                    another. Often, in the American experience, it involves a foreign born father
                    who decides to take the children back to a country of origin against the
                    mother's will. The mother is here in the United States. The child is abducted.
                    It is an abduction if there is already a court order requiring that the child
                    remain in the United States or under an American jurisdiction. We set a pattern
                    for those negotiations and had some successful conclusions. Now, agreements
                    covering that sort of abduction are much more widespread, and there is a general
                    multilateral convention on the subject. That was a major effort.</p>
                <p>We had a continuing run of American-born women who had unhappy marriages to
                    Muslim husbands. In the Muslim societies of the world, where women have very few
                    rights and privileges, the American wives would sometimes have trouble escaping
                    their husband's family in order to return to the United States. There was a
                    whole series of problems that we were engaged in.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>We had, and the State Department still has, an Emergency Operation Center in the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs for individual cases that arise. For example,
                    somebody is hurt in an accident or falls ill, and something has to be done
                    immediately. There is always somebody there in the Emergency Operations Center
                    to take a phone call and respond. It is one of the most painful assignments a
                    person can have to be the person responsible for informing the family in the
                    United States that a spouse, a son or daughter, a parent has suddenly been
                    killed or died somewhere. We have extensive training programs and we have
                    manuals on how to break the news and how to deal with it. Invariably, there is a
                    series of instant decisions that the family has to make in a moment of extreme
                    stress. Emotionally, they're not capable of making any decisions wisely or
                    consistently. Yet we have to force the issue, because in many countries if a
                    person has died, the person must either be buried locally or prepared for
                    international shipment to return to the US within a very short period of
                    time—usually 24 or 48 hours. This involves a lot of expense and enormous amounts
                    of paper work.</p>
                <p>There were problems with burnout among the officers on the Emergency Services
                    Desk in Citizen Services in Washington. After a certain number of weeks of being
                    the bearer of bad news and receiving abuse day after day from bereaved family
                    members, our people would have to be taken off the line to have their batteries
                    recharged. They would have to be given a certain amount of emotional surcease
                    themselves, or they couldn't continue to handle it, and things would go wrong.
                    That is probably the single, biggest problem for those people doing Citizen
                    Services.</p>
                <p>There are other events that demand Citizen Services people who really know what
                    their business is. For example, whenever there is a crisis some place, like the
                    genocide in Rwanda, the threats in Burundi, or the threats to tourism in
                    Kashmir. I'm speaking of contemporary problems now, but there's always something
                    like that going on somewhere in the world. When it's a new issue, typically the
                    State Department puts together a Task Force in the Operations Center to manage
                    the issue. One element of that task force is a consular support operation which
                    will be very heavily involved on the Citizen Services side to deal with the
                    families in the US, to help the Consular Officers overseas to extend the
                    services that are necessary.</p>
                <p>The Citizen Services office in Washington is the smallest in the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairs. Its people typically work flat out much of the time. I've
                    described some of the down sides. There is, however, one thing in Citizen
                    Services which I recall from my own experience overseas. That is, when you have
                    saved an American overseas, when you've managed to provide real relief and
                    comfort to somebody in distress, there is a personal satisfaction in knowing
                    that you've done that. That is a source of elation — just knowing that you have
                    helped somebody in providing a benefit that cannot be bought. So it is both
                    extraordinarily stressful and extraordinarily rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a sort of classic conflict between the political
                        or geographic bureau in the Department of State, and often the Ambassador,
                        and the Consular Bureau and the Consular Officer on the ground in a country
                        where there's a real problem — particularly civil war, civil unrest, or
                        something like this. One might say to Americans that it's not a good idea to
                        go there, but this upsets the host country. I think that our attitude has
                        changed considerably now, but we're talking about this period in the mid
                        1980's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The answer is yes, but I didn't see that as often as I had seen it when I
                    was in Political Sections in the 1970's and 1960's. During that stage of the
                    1980's we were in the process of changing the institutional culture. I mean, the
                    institutional culture in the geographic bureaus of the Department of State and
                    in the political direction of our missions overseas. So they understood that the
                    first responsibility of an American Foreign Service post is the protection of
                    American citizens and their property and the prevention of risk to Americans
                    when that is necessary. I'll give you an example.</p>
                <p>Crime had become extraordinarily dangerous along the main north-south highway on
                    the western side of Mexico. The route connected Arizona to Mexico City. There
                    was also some substantial crime along the eastern route which ran from Texas,
                    through Monterrey, to Mexico City. American tourists were being stopped by
                    persons masquerading as police officers who then robbed, raped or sometimes
                    killed the tourists. One of the things that the Bureau of Consular Affairs does
                    is to distribute to the public notices regarding dangerous places in the world
                    and precautions to take. We needed to do that about the crime. We were having a
                    long series of problems with Mexico. We didn't need to rub additional salt in
                    their wounds.</p>
                <p>There were a couple of problems in Mexico City when we sent our draft notice to
                    the Embassy there for comment. I think that our Ambassador was John Gavin, a
                    person from Hollywood who did very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was well acquainted with Mexico.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He was bilingual in Spanish and English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His mother was Mexican, I think. So he was well attuned to
                        Mexico.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>ROWELL: However, in the end, and it didn't take very long to get to the end, the
                    Mexicans said, “We recognize that you have to put out a notice.” That experience
                    really paralleled the experiences we had in other places. No Embassy, no
                    Political Section really wanted to refuse to put out a notice of this kind. What
                    they wanted to do was to massage the language to make it as inoffensive as
                    possible without obscuring the core message. This was that, if you travel to
                    this area, there are some dangers that you have to be aware of. You ought to
                    think a whole lot about that before you undertake the travel. If you believe
                    that you need to travel anyhow, then think about how you're going to manage your
                    risks. That's usually the essence of the message. That's also consistent with
                    our own Constitution which, after all, guarantees freedom of movement. The
                    notices required some massaging, but there were no brick walls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were in Consular Affairs George Shultz
                        was the Secretary of State, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a lot of things on his plate. Did you find that he
                        had any interest in consular affairs or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: George Shultz was probably the best top executive manager the Department
                    of State has ever known. I think that career people, both Civil Service and
                    Foreign Service, still long for George Shultz. My personal contacts with him
                    were limited. They arose almost entirely in the Mexican context, but
                    occasionally with the Caribbean area and with China.</p>
                <p>At the time we had semi-annual meetings between the Presidents of Mexico and the
                    United States, and even more frequent meetings between the Mexican Foreign
                    Minister and our Secretary of State. I don't recall what the particular elements
                    of conflict were, but there were lots of them. I recall that one day I went to a
                    meeting in Shultz's office. I had to tell him that a whole series of consular
                    issues was unresolved and was likely to remain unresolved because we and the
                    Mexicans simply disagreed, and we had American citizens at risk. Shultz said,
                    “Fine. So what we have for this meeting of the Presidents is damage limitation.
                    I think that we'd better change the schedule and reduce the amount of time spent
                    between the two Presidents, because we're not going to get this issue solved
                    before they meet. They can raise it, but let's not expect President Reagan to
                    resolve it. We're just too far apart. The elements are too 'tender.' I'll have
                    to take it up in depth with the Mexican Foreign Minister.”</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>What was important about the meeting was this. Other parts of the Department of
                    State dealing primarily with our economic and business relationship with Mexico
                    and, to a more limited extent, some of our political relationships, all had at
                    least some good news. I had virtually none. I had lots of bad news and it was
                    germane to the meeting. Shultz's whole reaction was, “Okay, I don't shoot the
                    messenger. Make sure you keep me apprized of all developments, right up to the
                    last minute. Design for me a 'damage limitation schedule' in Consular Affairs.
                    Thank you very much.”</p>
                <p>I'm not unique. I'm sure he responded that way to everybody who brought problems
                    to his table. He gave directions on how he wanted us to manage the problems and
                    what his role would be in it. If it involved the White House, what the White
                    House role would be. Everybody went out and worked their fannies off. Every
                    single one of us would go back to George Shultz in an instant. We had a very
                    good sense of what it was that required HIS attention and what it was that we
                    would manage on our own.</p>
                <p>So Secretary George Shultz was a person who understood the first rule of
                    management. That is, to get the right job done well by working through others.
                    When you have a Secretary of State who spends all of his time negotiating
                    abroad, he is not managing. If you have a Secretary of State who does that, and
                    sometimes it is unavoidable, then you must have a Deputy Secretary of State who
                    does manage and who manages in the Shultz fashion. When you have a Secretary and
                    Deputy Secretary, neither of whom manages in the Shultz fashion, you have a
                    badly managed Department of State and Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're certainly talking about the present situation, but
                        we've had this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Not just this. I made a generic statement and I meant it to apply
                    generically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back, you don't find many good examples. I don't
                        think that the administration of the Department of State by Secretary James
                        Baker was very strong in this regard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The administration of the Department by Secretary Baker was very closed
                    in its operation of foreign affairs. I said that sometimes the Secretary of
                    State cannot escape these things. I'll give you an example.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>When Kissinger was Secretary of State during the 1970's, he set the precedent.
                    Succeeding Secretaries have been personally negotiating Mid-East peace.
                    Kissinger himself set the pattern in a way that convinced, for example,
                    President Assad of Syria that the only serious talks involving the US on
                    Mid-East peace would have to be with the Secretary of State and no one lower in
                    the hierarchy. Well, Assad is still there. When Syria is on the agenda, it's
                    probably necessary for the Secretary of State to do some talking with him,
                    because Assad will not listen seriously to anybody else. At least, not yet. Now,
                    that ought to change. After all, the establishment that made it possible for him
                    to be so difficult for so long, the Soviet Union, disappeared years ago. So
                    something has to bend. Maybe one of the things that has to bend is the level at
                    which various negotiations are conducted. There will be other events that demand
                    the presence of the Secretary of State. However, fundamentally, a top manager
                    has to manage and be involved in a limited number of negotiations. He has to
                    have an alter ego who is really managing the other events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other areas that we should cover regarding
                        your assignment to Consular Affairs, before we move on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Let me see. I don't think so. We can always come back if something occurs
                    to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left Consular Affairs in 1985. Where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I went as Ambassador to Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I was in Bolivia from August, 1985, through January, 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this appointment come about? For one thing, you
                        weren't an ARA hand at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I'd been out of ARA since 1970, so this is now 15 years later. On the
                    other hand, I had maintained my relationships with people in ARA. When I left
                    ARA, I had been in that bureau for over 12 years. So once you have established
                    yourself over such a period of time, you always retain a residual reputation in
                    the bureau. That's when it has value.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Ron Spiers was the Under Secretary of State for Management. He supported the
                    internal process by which the Deputies Committee and then the Secretary of State
                    decided whom the Department would propose as the career officer nominee for a
                    mission. Ron was determined to enhance the effective role of functional bureaus
                    in the Department of State. That meant that persons willing to take, say, Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State positions in functional bureaus should have a crack
                    at being a chief of mission. Ron was pushing that.</p>
                <p>His senior assistant in 1984, Bill De Pree, had been putting together the lists
                    of career officers to be considered as candidates to be Ambassador. I had known
                    Bill De Pree off and on in the corridors for many years. I bumped into Bill in
                    the corridor in early December, 1984. I hadn't seen him for some time. Bill
                    said, “Ed Rowell.” I said, “Bill, what are you doing?” He said, “I've been
                    working on chief of mission lists.” I suppose that something expressed itself on
                    my face, because I said nothing. He said, “Ed, would you be interested in being
                    included on one of these lists?” I said, “Of course I would.” Naturally. What
                    else does a career Foreign Service Officer want? Bill said, “Well, this is a
                    good time.” Within a week I had a call asking if I would be willing to be
                    short-listed for an Embassy in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what the term, short list meant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: When the Department of State is putting together a list of career
                    officers for various missions, they get a substantial number of names for each
                    mission. Typically they are doing lists for large numbers of missions around the
                    world. Even within a given geographic area there will be quite a few lists.
                    Sometimes there will be only four or five, but sometimes there will be as many
                    as 10 or 12, depending on the number of missions in the area. Candidate names
                    are solicited from all over the Department of State. For any one mission there
                    typically may be anywhere from 20 to 50 potential candidates. Then the Offices
                    of the Director General of the Foreign Service, the Under Secretary for
                    Management and the Deputy Secretary trim the lists down to five names for each
                    Embassy. These are the “short lists”. Each of them may contain from three to six
                    names. The Deputy Secretary's Committee will then recommend one from each list
                    to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State also sees the other options.
                    He picks the person whose name will go to the White House as the career officer
                    candidate to be Ambassador at each mission where there will be a vacancy. At
                    least this is the way it worked in 1985.</p>
                <p>De Pree was asking if I would consent to have my name put on that short list of
                    five or six potential nominees that the Deputy Secretary's committee would send
                    to the Secretary. They had to name the specific post for which I would be a
                    candidate. It turned out to be Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. That was
                    fine with me. You have to start somewhere. They came out of the Deputies
                    Committee with agreement</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 6, Side A, of the interview with Ambassador
                        Ed Rowell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Since I was getting feedback orally and informally, I'm not certain of
                    all of the details. However, I think that my name went over to the White House
                    for appointment as Ambassador in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>Now the Department of State sends to the White House Office of Personnel a list
                    of diplomatic missions that will become vacant with a career officer candidate
                    proposed for each of the pending vacancies. The Director of the White House
                    Office of Personnel then pulls out a list of non-career persons for whom the
                    administration is seeking places to appoint. Then there will be a meeting
                    between the Deputy Secretary of State and the Director of the Office of
                    Personnel at the White House. The White House Personnel Director will say, “I
                    have to have Embassies for at least x-number of non-career people.” Sometimes he
                    is quite specific as to which non-careerists should go to which Embassies.</p>
                <p>On the average, although this varies with the administration, what happens is
                    that, if you go over with a list of, let's say, 15 Missions to be filled in
                    Latin America over the coming 12 months and you have 15 career officer
                    candidates, the White House Director of Personnel will say, “Five of these
                    Missions have to go to non career people. Here is a list of the non-career
                    people we want to appoint.”</p>
                <p>In my case was that another career officer was bumped from a more prestigious
                    destination to make room for a non career appointee, and they decided to send
                    that other career officer to be Ambassador in Santo Domingo. So I no assignment
                    and my name went back to the Department of State.</p>
                <p>In the Department they said, “All right, we're going to have to go back to the
                    White House because there are several of these vacancies which are still
                    undecided. Is it all right if we go back to the White House and say, 'We want Ed
                    Rowell in Asuncion, Paraguay?'” I agreed. They went through the process again,
                    came back, and said, “Well, Ed, what's happened is that you can't go to
                    Paraguay. Somebody else, a career officer, is going to go there. However,
                    another career officer to whom we absolutely had to give a Mission was slated
                    for Ambassador in La Paz, Bolivia, but he can't go there for health reasons. So
                    the White House has agreed that you can go to La Paz, if you're willing.”
                    [Laughter] I replied, “On this one I've got to think for 24 hours.” You know, La
                    Paz is way up in the clouds somewhere, thousands of feet up. What are the health
                    hazards? It's a major coca growing area. There is the drug traffic and all kinds
                    of problems that make the headlines. So they gave me the 24 hours to consider
                    this. I talked it over with my wife and said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>This time word came back from the White House that they had agreed on me “in
                    principle” for La Paz. “In principle” meant that the White House Director of
                    Personnel agreed, but that the President had not yet been consulted formally. I
                    knew, though, that for a non-controversial career officer, “in principle” meant
                    “yes.”</p>
                <p>That information came back in January, 1984. The processing began immediately.
                    It's a long process because you fill out reams of paper on your background for
                    the Senate, for the President, for your security check, and so on. You have to
                    certify that you have no financial interests that could constitute a conflict of
                    interest. I had none. Then, eventually, when all the papers were together, they
                    all went to the White House. The White House Counsel's Office looked them over
                    to make sure that there were no conflicts of interest and that this appointment
                    was unlikely to raise any kind of a problem with the press or in public
                    relations terms. The White House Counsel's Office is a little more flexible if
                    there is a potential problem with one of the political or non career appointees,
                    because there is an assumption that there is strong political support for making
                    that appointment. Otherwise, that person would not be so highly regarded by the
                    White House Office of Personnel. Therefore, there is potentially significantly
                    more political support within the Senate that would allow a non-career candidate
                    to get over the hurdle. They are never so confident about political support for
                    a career officer, although some of them do have it.</p>
                <p>In my case the papers went over to the Senate in early May, 1984. There was a
                    major slow down in nomination and appointment hearings. Senator Jesse Helms
                    [Republican, North Carolina] had put a series of holds that, in effect,
                    frustrated the efforts of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold any confirmation hearings at all.
                    Eventually, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator
                    Richard Lugar [Republican, Indiana], stepped in and conducted the hearings
                    himself. I had my hearing in June, 1984. It probably took no more than half an
                    hour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any in-depth questioning on your
                        appointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Nothing significant. I can tell you that, by that time, I was working
                    very closely with the Bureau of American Republics Affairs, and particularly
                    with the Bolivia desk, as well as with the Bureau of Narcotics Affairs. I
                    prepared a long series of questions and answers. I went through the Murder
                    Board. That's where you sit in a room, and people fire nasty questions at you.
                    You answer them orally.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>For the hearing itself I prepared a written opening statement which I asked to
                    have entered into the record, and then made a complementary oral statement at
                    the beginning of the hearing. At the hearing I went to the witness table at the
                    designated hour (they were hearing two nominees per hour). The Committee Chair,
                    Senator Lugar, that they had received my prepared statement and asked if I
                    wanted to make an oral statement. I said that I did. I reviewed my Foreign
                    Service experience. I reaffirmed my own commitment to try to defeat drugs, to
                    try to help Bolivia to have a safe, democratic transition, to help Bolivia to
                    privatize its economy and move toward a market economy from the previous
                    socialist economy. I introduced my wife and cited the valuable partnership which
                    she has always provided me throughout my Foreign Service career and which I knew
                    she would provide if I were confirmed and appointed as Ambassador to Bolivia. I
                    also introduced other members of my family who were there.</p>
                <p>The Senators asked one or two, pro forma questions. They were really quite
                    friendly. They had a list of questions that had to be answered in writing, but
                    none of them was terribly difficult to answer. Obviously, whether replying
                    orally or in writing, the objective is to be forthright about problems and
                    policies, but in a way that doesn't hurt a new Ambassador's ability to pursue US
                    policies effectively with the authorities of the country where he/she is to go.
                    I was confirmed by the Senate about five or six weeks later. Ordinarily it can
                    take as little as two to ten days for full Senate confirmation following a
                    non-controversial hearing. But Senator Helms was still slowing down the
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that you've already answered this question in
                        large part. Most new chiefs of mission have a list of problems to try to
                        solve or do something about. When you went to Bolivia, what was your
                        agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: At the time of my confirmation Bolivia was having an election. This was
                    at the end of a period which really began in the late 1970's and continued
                    through the early 1980's. There had been a series of governments that had taken
                    office through extra-constitutional means — in other words, coups d'�tat. At one
                    stage there had been a military officer in government who was notoriously
                    involved in the drug traffic. That person had been succeeded by a President who
                    was a member of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement of Bolivia [MNR], a
                    socialist party affiliated with the Socialist International. The MNR had moved
                    more closely toward constitutional government, including the holding of
                    elections.</p>
                <p>They held a democratic election. No candidate won a majority of the votes. The
                    President then had to be selected by the lower chamber of the National Congress,
                    the House of Deputies. The candidate who had won a plurality of the votes for
                    President, Hugo Banzer, a conservative, lost to one of the founding fathers of
                    the MNR, Victor Paz Estenssoro. This was a constitutional process, fairly and
                    democratically conducted.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Paz Estenssoro had first become President in 1952 following the socialist
                    revolution that produced Latin America's first agrarian reform since the Mexican
                    Revolution of 1910. This, 1985, was the fourth time that Paz Estenssoro had
                    become President of Bolivia. Paz Estenssoro took office on a platform that was
                    dedicated to modernizing the economy and undoing the excesses that had crept
                    into the socialist revolution.</p>
                <p>My agenda was to reaffirm democratic, constitutional government; to support Paz
                    Estenssoro in implementing his platform and to work with Bolivia to straighten
                    out its economy, which was a disaster; and to do everything possible to cut back
                    on the production of coca leaves and cocaine precursor products, as well as
                    everything I could to break up drug trafficking. The country's disastrous
                    economy was propelling more and more of its citizens to become associated with
                    the drug traffic — just in order to survive economically. That was a big enough
                    agenda for any mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time the Reagan administration was pushing hard on
                        the problem of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and revolutionary groups in El
                        Salvador. This seemed to be the main focus of our foreign policy in Latin
                        America. Did this impinge at all on what you were up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Only peripherally in a very limited way. There was a Cuban representative
                    in La Paz trying to find out if there was a potential for a Nicaraguan type of
                    situation. Despite the socialist background of many people in the Bolivian
                    Government, they were not particularly helpful to the Cubans and Nicaraguans.
                    They received them but didn't give them a lot of help. The Bolivians had a lot
                    of their own problems, and neither Cuba nor Nicaragua was doing anything to make
                    life easier for Bolivia. So, as I say, although there was Cuban representation
                    in La Paz, and I think that there was a Nicaraguan office, although I'm not
                    certain. I'd have to look that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the President of Bolivia and
                        his government at this time? Was he there during the whole time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: He was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was sort of remarkable, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was. He and his government were all extremely open and accessible to
                    me. In fact, I flew to Bolivia as part of the US Delegation to the inauguration
                    of Victor Paz Estenssoro. We all agreed that, even though I had already been
                    confirmed, my predecessor would remain there as US Ambassador for the
                    inauguration. He had been there for almost four years. He had had some
                    extraordinarily difficult times. He deserved to see success at the end of his
                    mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Ed Corr. As the American Ambassador, he had done everything that an
                    Ambassador can do to reaffirm the democratic process and to help the Bolivians
                    to make their country succeed. It had succeeded. It was only appropriate that he
                    be there, as the US Ambassador, for the inauguration of a democratically elected
                    President. Nobody had any trouble with that arrangement. So he was there in
                    Bolivia. I simply went down as part of the US Delegation.</p>
                <p>I was well received, though. I met President Paz Estenssoro and the outgoing
                    President, Jaime Paz Zamora, as well as a number of senior Bolivian officials. I
                    went back to the US. Then, three weeks later, I returned to Bolivia. I presented
                    my credentials to Paz Estenssoro either on the day I arrived or on the following
                    day. Virtually immediately, in other words. So I was the functioning Ambassador
                    within 24 hours of arriving in Bolivia. That's what I regard as extraordinarily
                    forthcoming on the part of the Bolivians, in terms of the formalities of
                    presenting credentials.</p>
                <p>When I went to Portugal as Ambassador some time later, the Portuguese were
                    desperately anxious to have an American Ambassador. They knew me personally.
                    They told our Charg� d'Affaires and the Department of State that they were
                    elated that I was coming as Ambassador. However, it still took over two weeks to
                    present my credentials. The Bolivians signaled how anxious they were to have me
                    and to have a strong and effective relationship with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over the period of time that you were in Bolivia did you
                        see the President often or was it the type of government where you didn't
                        have to see the President? Or did the ministers also have some weight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: First of all, each of the cabinet ministers had some weight. Secondly, I
                    saw the President at reasonable intervals. Sometimes it was on social occasions
                    or at ceremonial affairs where I knew the President would be. If you can squeeze
                    your agenda to something small enough, you can discuss at a social or ceremonial
                    event even when it's meaty. However, for those issues that required that I go to
                    the President personally, I always asked for a private interview and I met him
                    in his office. On a very few occasions I met with him at his residence.
                    Sometimes that was to escape the eye of the press. Remember also that Paz
                    Estenssoro was 78 years old when he took office on this occasion. He was a
                    senior citizen. Sometimes I would meet him at his residence simply to reduce
                    stress on him.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>However, I did the bulk of my business with the cabinet ministers. They had real
                    responsibilities. I often worked with the Minister of Planning, Gonzalo Sanchez
                    De Lozada, for example, who had arranged for Jeffrey Sachs to come to Bolivia.
                    Sanchez de Lozada from Banzer's party and was the strong key to the country's
                    economic recovery and modernization. He is now President of Bolivia. Anyhow, he
                    and the Mayor of La Paz, Ronald MacLean, were from the same, conservative party.
                    The Mayor of La Paz had gone to the John F. Kennedy School of Government at
                    Harvard, had met Sachs there, and had proposed during the presidential election
                    campaign that his party bring Sachs down to help it to develop a program for
                    restoring the economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain who Jeffrey Sachs is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Jeffrey Sachs was a professor of economics at the John F. Kennedy School
                    of Government at Harvard. He helped Banzer's party to develop an economic
                    program for the conversion of the economy to a full market-based economy and for
                    the privatization of government-owned enterprises — the whole bit.</p>
                <p>When Paz Estenssoro was elected President, he had half expected NOT to be
                    elected. After all, Hugo Banzer had won a plurality of the popular vote. Paz
                    Estenssoro's party, the MNR, had not developed an economic program. Well, Paz
                    Estenssoro was elected by the Chamber of Deputies and entered office. He needed
                    a government that would command some support from the single largest block of
                    votes in the Congress — that is, the conservative party. He adopted the Banzer
                    party's economic program. To a substantial extent that program had been master
                    minded by the man whom Paz Estenssoro had appointed Minister of Planning,
                    Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.</p>
                <p>After the new government was installed in office, they brought Sachs down as a
                    consultant for the overall economic program. At that point inflation had gone
                    wildly out of control. They leaned on Sachs for advice on containing inflation
                    and straightening out government finances. Sachs came down twice, I believe, at
                    Bolivian Government expense. After that they still needed his advice, but
                    couldn't afford it. So Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada brought Sachs down to Bolivia
                    at least twice, maybe three times more, at his own personal expense. It cost
                    over $20,000 per visit.</p>
                <p>The Bolivian Government took Sachs' advice. They dealt with the inflation
                    problem. By the time I left Bolivia inflation was in the single digits, down
                    from 23,000% per year when I had arrived. That experience gave Sachs world
                    reknown as an inflation slayer and economy modernizer. It contributed directly
                    to a comparable effort he undertook in central Europe and, briefly, in Russia
                    after the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>

                    <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that one of your goals was privatization of the
                        economy. It's all part of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I want to emphasize that this goal was consistent with the program of the
                    newly-installed government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in a way, what did you do, outside of saying, “Go to
                        it, fellows?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: First of all, I tried to expand the economic assistance program to
                    provide technical assistance where the Bolivians could use it in the conversion
                    process. They had a number of ideas, and the AID Mission Director also came up
                    with some good ideas. Secondly, there were some old investment conflicts, the
                    most significant of which involved Gulf Oil and Occidental Petroleum. I talked
                    repeatedly with the government about ways to deal with them and to resolve them.
                    The companies were open in keeping me informed about their negotiations with the
                    government. The point I made to the government was, “Look, if you want to
                    privatize, that means that you want private investment to come in. You want
                    foreign private investment. It's going to be very hard to get that foreign
                    private investment in until you resolve these old problems. In terms of the
                    content of such a resolution, you and the private firms are not that far apart.
                    It's a very small step to closure.”</p>
                <p>I didn't attempt to become a negotiator but rather a kind of ombudsman and a
                    persuader. They did come to closure with the oil companies and resolved the
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How responsive were American companies in dealing with
                        Bolivia during your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I found that they were always happy to deal with the Ambassador. They
                    wanted to solve their own problems. The experienced companies would come to me
                    and say, “We're having this problem. We're not asking you to intervene. We want
                    you to understand the problem. If you see an opportunity to help us, we would
                    appreciate your letting us know.”</p>
                <p>For example, there were some limited problems involving the electric power
                    company, which was Canadian and American owned. This company needed a new
                    contract with the city of La Paz, so they needed to expand their capacity. This
                    represented a substantial new investment which meant that they needed a new
                    contract that would give them a reasonable time over which to amortize the new
                    investment. However, it was a difficult issue because it meant some guarantees
                    in terms of electricity rates, ensuring payment for the power produced, and all
                    the rest. These were typical of the problems which faced the utilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>There the issue was primarily with the city of La Paz, rather than with the
                    Bolivian Government. However, it was important to keep the Bolivian Government
                    in synch with the city of La Paz and avoid inadvertently doing something that
                    would complicate resolution of the problem. The Mayor of the city was reasonably
                    open, but he was politically constrained, to some extent. I talked with him,
                    with his opposition, and with the Bolivian Private Business Confederation to try
                    to create an atmosphere that would make it easier for the city of La Paz to
                    agree to a settlement. They managed to come to some agreements, but the problem
                    wasn't completely resolved when I left Bolivia.</p>
                <p>The government needed to privatize the mines. That meant laying off large numbers
                    of miners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even for somebody who has never served in Latin America, I
                        have heard about miners who run around with sticks of dynamite in their
                        belts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Exactly. In fact, a “miner's hot dog” is a half stick of dynamite with
                    the fuse lit. The government eventually laid off some 20,000 of these miners.
                    The miners got transportation to La Paz and demonstrated in the streets. They
                    threw a couple of “miners' hot dogs” at the Embassy. On one occasion the
                    explosion injured our Security Officer and several police and broke some glass.
                    On another occasion we had a dynamite stick dropped on the roof of the Embassy
                    from an adjacent building. It blew in a bunch of windows and narrowly missed my
                    wife and a number of other persons who had been in the Language Training Room at
                    the Embassy. They were having a coffee break at the precise moment when the
                    dynamite stick went off. I think that the timing was accidental. I don't think
                    that the person who dropped the stick of dynamite on the Embassy roof knew
                    anything about our internal schedule. Fortunately, although the explosion made a
                    mess of the Language Training Room, nobody was physically in it at that instant.
                    Still, it was stressful.</p>
                <p>We used the Food for Peace program to help the Bolivian Government to find
                    alternative work on useful infrastructure for those miners and their families
                    who were willing to work. For example, people in the program worked on water
                    systems and built drainage ditches and irrigation canals in cities and small
                    villages in the mining areas of Bolivia, in exchange for food. That gave their
                    families something to live on and made their living conditions a little bit
                    healthier. While this was going on, the government put together programs to help
                    relocate the miners to areas where they could find permanent work. That program
                    was very well received.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>I traveled to all of the sites where we were operating this program. I talked
                    directly with the workers, with their union leaders, and with their community
                    and social leaders in open meetings and with workers standing around. I had to
                    talk in Spanish because I didn't understand the Indian languages, Quechua or
                    Aymara, depending on the area. Their leaders all spoke acceptable Spanish, so
                    that I could do that. Universally, I found self respect, because they felt that
                    they were working on these Food for Peace projects and, at the same time,
                    improving their communities. They were grateful for the assistance. Even though
                    the country was going through a privatization program in the direction of a
                    market economy, I found a positive attitude toward the United States. If an
                    American company wanted to invest in Bolivia, the ordinary Bolivians were
                    positive about that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that, by the time you arrived in Bolivia, the
                        course of aggressive socialism had pretty well lost its luster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. People believed that Bolivia had lived some sort of
                    “socialism” ever since the 1952 revolution (with some time out for a couple of
                    military governments). Ordinary folk, the indigenous population, had their own
                    land, controlled their own villages. Their post-1952-revolution society had
                    plenty of problems. So, Ch� Guevara the Argentine Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
                    associated with Fidel Castro found rocky soil when he tried to foment a new
                    “socialist revolution” among the campesinos, poor country folk, in Bolivia. The
                    campesinos told the army where he was and he was killed. I guess you could say
                    that “socialism” had lost its lustre.</p>
                <p>But the Catholic Church and the universities in Bolivia, including those which
                    were Church-related, had absorbed substantial numbers of priests who belonged to
                    — what was it called in Latin America? — the Liberation Theology movement. The
                    universities in Bolivia had become sanctuaries for liberation theologians and
                    their secular allies, many of whom were Marxist/Leninists. They had received a
                    lot of support from Cuba and from Nicaragua over the years. They were
                    established and deeply rooted in Bolivia. They were affecting the thought
                    processes of substantial numbers of university students. They still had
                    considerable influence on many teachers in Bolivia's secondary schools.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>The Catholic Church, or at least some of the key Church leaders, as well as the
                    Papal Nuncio, were trying to attenuate the influence of the liberation
                    theologians. The country didn't have enough recruits in its seminaries to staff
                    its churches. So they were bringing in priests from other countries, including
                    European countries. They were working with this problem as well. I found, for
                    example, a Bishop of Andean Indian origin in a diocese near Lake Titicaca who
                    was trying to establish a new Church-sponsored advanced technical agricultural
                    school. He was putting up an institute that focused on farming and agricultural
                    economics. It was intended to help the children of indigenous laborers, almost
                    all Native American children, so they wouldn't have to attend the Marxist
                    seedbed at the big city universities. I worked very hard to support his
                    institute. The amount of help that we could give was limited. We used some Food
                    for Peace help in putting up his buildings. We tried to find ways — through
                    private organizations, not government — to assist in financing his faculty, some
                    of the needed equipment, and to get a new syllabus that would not be a
                    liberation theology syllabus but simply practical courses in farming and in farm
                    economics. The Bishop inaugurated the institute and opened the first classes
                    there before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, the first priority on your time there was the
                        drug situation. What was it when you arrived, and what could we do...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Coca growing was spreading rapidly. There is a whole bunch of myths in
                    terms of coca and cocaine economics. For example, we were assuming that the
                    production coefficients for coca and cocaine which we had discovered in Peru
                    were valid also for Bolivia. But it turned out that Bolivia was different. It
                    was less than half as efficient as Peru in terms of cocaine output per hectare
                    of coca leaf. It also had some vulnerabilities in terms of production and
                    transport that Peru didn't have. So we made some startling discoveries.</p>
                <p>However, the first effort was to get Bolivia to pass a law that would make coca
                    growing illegal — or, if not wholly illegal, then substantially illegal—so that
                    we would have a legal basis for trying to reduce coca production. We tried to
                    get Bolivia to upgrade its anti-drug police efforts and operations against drug
                    laboratories. We sought to reduce the effectiveness of the drug trafficking
                    community, particularly in terms of its ability to corrupt police authorities
                    and other officials. And, overall, to reduce the flow of drug-related products
                    from Bolivia. The products were mostly going to Colombia for final processing
                    and then on to the US. However, a lot of product was also going to other Latin
                    American countries and starting to flow to Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop at this point. The next time we get together we
                        still will be reviewing your time in Bolivia, 1985-1988. You've just
                        finished explaining what the status of the drug traffic was. So we'll talk
                        about what we were doing at that time to deal with it. One of the questions
                        I do want to ask you is this. You said that we were assuming that what was
                        happening in Peru in terms of coca cultivation and all of that was the same
                        in Bolivia. We can talk about what you found that was different in Bolivia
                        and then talk about efforts we were making in that direction. We've already
                        talked about the economic situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: There's one more thing that I'm going to talk about on the economic
                    situation. It relates to the small loan program.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is March 4, 1996. Ed, do you want to continue where
                        we were in our previous session?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. The critical intelligence on what made Bolivia different from Peru
                    was produced by the Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] through confidential
                    informants that they had developed. They deserve an enormous amount of credit in
                    this respect.</p>
                <p>First of all, we found that the coefficients of production for converting coca
                    leaves to cocaine were half as much in Bolivia as they were in Peru. I don't
                    know why. I don't know whether it was the type of leaf or the primitive way in
                    which they extracted the alkaloid from those leaves — although I imagine that
                    the initial extraction process it was pretty primitive in Peru as well. Whatever
                    the reason, the process of extraction of the alkaloid was only half as efficient
                    in Bolivia.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we were able to confirm that the people growing the leaf were very poor
                    and were doing it simply to get money and to survive. There was a down side to
                    that. I recall one set of remote mountain villages in a part of Bolivia that has
                    always relied on barter trade and still does today. The village agreed to
                    eradicate all of its food and fiber crops and to plant coca. They harvested the
                    coca leaf. The drug traffickers bought the leaf. Then, when the village went to
                    neighboring villages to buy food, the neighboring villages said, “We'll be glad
                    to sell you the food we always sell you. Will you please give us the fibers and
                    foods that you used to give us?” The people from the first village said, “Well,
                    we don't have that, but we have all of this money, and we'll give you a lot of
                    money.” In that region people said, “We can't eat money. Sorry. When you can
                    bring us some goods, we'll trade.”</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>This village was sufficiently remote that going down to the Lake Titicaca region
                    to buy food, or something like that, involved a major trek. It was very
                    difficult, and they didn't have much transport. A man I know, who was affiliated
                    with the United Nations, reported that within three years of the time the
                    village started growing coca serious malnutrition was observed among children
                    and child mortality more than doubled. This was not from abusing drugs but from
                    displacing itself from barter trade in an area that only had a barter economy.
                    This was an interesting development.</p>
                <p>We discovered that, for the most part, the poor people growing the coca leaf were
                    self-financed. That is, they would plant the leaf and would grow subsistence
                    crops between the rows of coca plants. When they harvested the coca leaf, they
                    would either process it themselves with chemicals that they obtained on a loan
                    basis or they would sell it to a person who would process it. However, they
                    received no cash compensation for their product until their product, which was
                    called coca paste [pasta de coca], a precursor product, cocaine sulfide, had
                    been converted into cocaine and marketed in the US Or elsewhere, and the money
                    had been physically flown back to Bolivia. So from the time that they delivered
                    the coca leaf until they got their money was sometimes four months. From the
                    time that they planted the coca plant to the time that they had their first full
                    harvest, was 24 months. This represented an enormous investment for somebody who
                    has little or no capital. They invested their time and a lot of sweat.</p>
                <p>We also found that there was an enormous vulnerability. We had been told and
                    convinced in Peru that if you attempted to destroy coca by whacking it off at
                    the stem where the plant comes out of the ground, it would grow back. However,
                    in fact, if you whack the plant off reasonably close to the ground, it does not
                    grow back. It has to be recultivated from seeds. Again, that was new
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That gave you a two-year hiatus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It gave us another destruction method, because, based on what we thought
                    we had learned in Peru, we were having to figure out ways to use chemicals to
                    destroy the coca which would simultaneously destroy all of the subsistence crops
                    nearby; or ways to bring in large plows to turnover the land and plow under the
                    coca in areas where you couldn't get the machinery in. The problems of
                    destruction, if you couldn't just cut it down, were enormous. This had been a
                    major inhibiting factor in putting together programs.</p>
                <p>We also found out a good deal about the ferrying mechanisms. At one time, for
                    example, most of the coca paste had been carted out of the growing area on
                    people's backs — sometimes on the backs of donkeys. The valleys where they were
                    growing coca were quite broad, and some of them even verged on being plains,
                    especially in the area toward eastern Bolivia. Access to these areas was
                    limited. The roads weren't there.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>There were some laboratories in Bolivia for converting the coca paste into
                    cocaine. The more efficient and more active laboratories were in Colombia. It
                    didn't make too much difference whether you flew the coca paste, the cocaine
                    sulfide, or refined cocaine hydrochloride out, because the paste converted to
                    cocaine hydrochloride, in terms of weight, approximately on a one-for-one basis.
                    Maybe it was one unit of paste to 0.9 units of cocaine hydrochloride, but that
                    was close enough. It wasn't a significant cost factor in deciding whether to fly
                    out paste or cocaine hydrochloride. What really decided the traffickers on which
                    they would do was more related to the chance of being interdicted. I talked with
                    some visiting Congressmen and made the point to them that we were frustrated in
                    Bolivia because we could not attack the laboratories which had been placed off
                    in the jungle. There was no way to get at them. There were no roads out there,
                    and we didn't have any helicopters. The Bolivian Air Force had only three
                    helicopters in their inventory. They were old, badly maintained, and unsafe. The
                    Bolivian Air Force itself wouldn't fly them.</p>
                <p>By the time I had spent three or four months in Bolivia, it was obvious to me
                    that we were doing nothing effective about coca leaf production. It was equally
                    obvious that Bolivian politicians were reluctant to alienate the peasant
                    population that was growing the coca. They depended on them for votes. I'm not
                    talking here about drug money and not talking here about bribes by kingpins of
                    the narcotics traffic from Medellin Colombia. I'm talking about politicians who
                    were elected by those people out there in the fields.</p>
                <p>I decided to develop a strategy that involved an early shock and a longer term,
                    follow-on program to try to get the peasants to give up coca growing and to go
                    into some kind of legitimate crops. I asked my Army Attach�, who was a veteran
                    helicopter pilot with service in Vietnam, to draw up a plan that I could propose
                    to the Southern Command [SOUTHCOM — the US Theater military command in Panama]
                    and to Washington to bring in helicopters. We could either lend them to the
                    Bolivian Air Force for the Bolivian Air Force to fly or have the US Army fly
                    them at first.</p>
                <p>The idea was to ferry the Bolivian Anti-Drug Police out into the jungle to
                    destroy laboratories that we might find. We had two principal ways of finding
                    them. One was information from confidential informants. Another was through
                    aerial surveys using various high tech devices to see through the jungle canopy
                    of trees.</p>
                <p>At the same time I asked the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy] to put
                    together a program involving the entire Country Team. That is, all of the US
                    agencies there in Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your DCM there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>ROWELL: My DCM at the time was Jeff Biggs, a USIA [United States Information
                    Agency] Foreign Service Officer. I asked him to put together an integrated
                    program that would involve components such as: putting pressure on campesinos to
                    cut down coca and stop growing; helping them to find alternative livelihoods;
                    and persuading the Bolivian Government to enact a law restraining or, ideally,
                    outlawing completely the cultivation of coca. Well, we knew that totally
                    outlawing it was impossible.</p>
                <p>There was a mythology in Bolivia that coca arrived from the Sun God and that the
                    Native Indian population would always have to have its coca, because this was a
                    sort of religious rite, and so forth. In fact, I later discovered that that was
                    a myth, too. Coca had been used by the Inca tribe as a favor bestowed on
                    certain, favorite people, who, in turn, bestowed it on other, favored people. It
                    was essentially a device to help control people. When the Spaniards arrived in
                    Bolivia in the early 16th century, they defeated the Inca and discovered coca.
                    They put it to work by using it on the native population, whom they put into
                    forced labor in the silver mines. This was done so that they could withstand the
                    cold outside, the heat inside the mines, and the hunger in their bellies — not
                    notice their discomforts and keep on working, producing silver and tin. So coca
                    was essentially a drug for enslavement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the opiate of the masses, aren't
                        we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, I hate to say that. Although people used coca, they used it for
                    quasi-medicinal purposes in the sense that they used it to alleviate physical
                    pain and hunger. That makes it different from the opiate of the masses. It was
                    not used in the way that alcohol is used, for example. So it was very different.
                    But that also puts a different caste on it for political purposes, because once
                    you manage to sweep away the mythology and you understand that coca was an
                    enslaving device, then it becomes easier to attack it.</p>
                <p>So we put together a program which involved trying to persuade the Bolivians to
                    pass an anti-coca law, have AID [Agency for International Development] put
                    together a program that would provide carrots incentives to the peasants, or
                    campesinos, if they would give up growing coca, as well as transition assistance
                    if they would give up coca. I regard transition assistance as not a motivator
                    but a facilitator. Obviously, our Public Affairs Office had to support the
                    programs that we developed and that we were negotiating with the Bolivian
                    Government. We used the Army Attach� and the Military Assistance offices to help
                    put together the interdiction program. First, this involved bringing in US Army
                    helicopters in an operation called Blast Furnace. Secondly, we planned to bring
                    in helicopters provided by funds from the State Department's anti-narcotics
                    program that were transferred on a long-term loan basis to the Bolivian Air
                    Force. Some people suggested giving these helicopters to the Bolivian Air Force.
                    I insisted that they be placed strictly on loan so that if, for some reason, the
                    program came apart, lost efficiency, or whatever, we could pull the helicopters
                    back and put them somewhere else where they'd be doing us more good.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>What other agencies were there? We used all of our intelligence assets in the
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] been involved in
                        this? The reason I ask this is that, from time to time, and particularly
                        with the end of the Cold War, which hadn't happened yet, there was a lot of
                        thought, to my knowledge, that CIA would have to concentrate on terrorism
                        and drug trafficking. Obviously, the Cold War had not played itself out as
                        yet in Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The CIA certainly contributed what it could in helping to identify drug
                    traffickers and elements of the drug traffic that might have vulnerabilities
                    that we might exploit. There was that sort of thing. However, they, as was the
                    case with all of us, were very, very careful, whenever a trafficking operation
                    was discovered that might eventually lead to a prosecution, to give it to the
                    DEA, as a law enforcement agency. So if we ever had to prosecute somebody in US
                    Courts, we would not get into that awful bind of having things there which
                    couldn't be turned over to the prosecution because, somehow or other, they had
                    been discovered by CIA. Everybody understood the rules. We followed them
                    religiously so as not to complicate any potential future prosecution.</p>
                <p>Now, CIA could also used some technical resources to help us locate the
                    laboratories in the jungle so the Bolivian Anti-Drug Police could attack them.
                    CIA worked very hard on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have the example of Colombia today, which is so
                        permeated with drug money and corruption, from President Ernesto Samper on
                        down. We're having a terrible problem with it. Could you talk a little bit
                        about the Bolivian Government as far as corruption within it is
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I'll talk about the corruption problem a little bit later. Let me finish
                    this comment about the drug laboratories. The drug kingpins operating out of
                    Colombia, and they really were kingpins of the drug traffic, basically used
                    Bolivia as a reserve supply source for coca paste, the precursor substance for
                    producing cocaine. Their primary sources were in Peru, Colombia, and, to a small
                    extent, in Brazil and Ecuador. However, the primary sources were Peru and
                    Colombia. The Bolivian supply of coca paste was there in case one of their other
                    sources suffered a catastrophe. It also was intended to keep down the price of
                    coca paste and to keep the people growing the coca in Peru and Colombia from
                    being able to jack up the price. So demand for coca paste in Bolivia fluctuated.
                    If things were going very well in Colombia and Peru and the traffickers were
                    moving all of the coca paste that they could make, then demand in Bolivia would
                    slacken. When demand was stronger than supply elsewhere, then the price would
                    strengthen.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>The Colombian kingpins stayed in Colombia. They sent agents to Bolivia as
                    necessary, so that at the time that I was in Bolivia, there was no indigenous,
                    cartel-like apparatus resident in Bolivia which was trying to call all the shots
                    as the cartel was doing in Colombia. So it was a very different situation.</p>
                <p>Now, back to the program that we put together. We had this long term program put
                    together by the Country Team and proposed a shock program to start it off. I
                    didn't hear from Washington for months after sending in my proposal for
                    helicopters just for the initial stage. However, I did hear from General Galvin,
                    who was the commander in chief of Southern Command [SOUTHCOM], about what was
                    going on in Washington. The State Department, the DEA [Drug Enforcement
                    Administration], and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] wouldn't tell me.
                    Of course, the DEA doesn't tell anybody except its favorite agents. But the
                    Defense Department keeps its senior commanders informed about what's developing,
                    so that when they blow the whistle to launch a program, they can take action.
                    Gen Galvin kept me informed.</p>
                <p>I received word from Washington in June, 1986, that the project that I had
                    submitted on January 1, 1986, was approved and that we were to launch it in two
                    weeks. That was two weeks to get Bolivian government consent, brief appropriate
                    authorities, bring in people and equipment from SOUTHCOM, establish operating
                    bases. That was the State Department. I was ready only because Gen Galvin and I
                    had been talking to each other regularly and he had known what was happening in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>So we launched the program. I might say that each of these programs, as we
                    attempted to implement them, was carried out with the full knowledge and consent
                    of the Bolivian Government, including the President of Bolivia, with whom I
                    cleared the activities personally prior to initiating them. He was the first
                    person I approached to get permission for Operation Blast Furnace. He gave us
                    his solid support. Then I followed up with the Bolivian Ministries that would be
                    involved, Defense and Interior. We had luck in getting the permission on such
                    short notice. The one person who might have blocked it, Planning Minister
                    Sanchez de Lozada, was in a Paris hospital recovering from an emergency
                    appendectomy. He feared that if we suddenly cut off the flow of drug money, his
                    efforts to restore the economy — and to make it capable of prospering without
                    drugs — would fail. I want to emphasize that his concerns were macroeconomic. He
                    was no friend of drug traffickers.</p>
                <p>We brought in US Army helicopters initially for a period of 120 days until State
                    Department helicopters could be brought in and loaned to the Bolivian Air Force,
                    and the Bolivian Air Force could fly them instead of having Americans flying
                    them. Our the initial strike destroyed a big coca processing laboratory. I don't
                    remember how many hundreds of kilos of coca paste were destroyed, but it was a
                    lot. Then two dry holes followed it. Then we destroyed a smaller sized
                    laboratory. Then there was a string of dry holes for about a week and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what a dry hole is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: A dry hole is a site that we attacked thinking that there was a coca lab
                    there, but which turned out to have nothing significant on the ground when our
                    forces arrived there. Most of the dry holes were laboratories from which the
                    equipment and chemicals had been removed.</p>
                <p>As we went through this process, incidentally, we discovered something else about
                    the coca paste laboratories. At one stage in the process of making cocaine, they
                    dried the coca paste into a powder to grind it up. The drying process requires
                    heat, and you can spot the heat with infrared equipment from anywhere and go
                    after it. To avoid detection, then, the laboratories stayed turned off until
                    they had a sufficient amount of product to operate at peak efficiency. So,
                    typically, a laboratory in the jungle might be turned off for two or three
                    months and then would run full blast for three weeks. Then it would go off
                    again. Microwave ovens were a problem. It used to be that the coca laboratories
                    would have to use an ordinary oven. Generally, they would be electric ovens,
                    powered by portable generators, which they bought in Brazil. Then microwave
                    ovens came along. Microwaves put out substantially less heat that could be
                    observed from a distance. And they are so cheap. They were as cheap as regular
                    ovens, for all practical purposes. As we destroyed the regular ovens, they were
                    replaced by microwave ovens, which were much harder to spot. So technology
                    complicated our lives.</p>
                <p>Something we always suspected, and which we were later able to confirm, was that
                    the drug traffickers who were operating airplanes flying between Colombia and
                    Bolivia had very sophisticated communications systems. They used these systems
                    when they were flying the coca paste out and the money in. They monitored all of
                    the radio communications that were in the air — ours, the Bolivian Government's
                    — everything. They monitored it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as if, to do that, you have to have a rather
                        sophisticated infrastructure in place in the country, don't you? Or could it
                        be done outside of Bolivia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You need a couple of sophisticated people and some fairly sophisticated
                    equipment. However, the equipment isn't terribly bulky. People could buy a Radio
                    Shack spectrum scanner for $300 to $400 for a top-of-the line model, which at
                    the time was as good as anything in the Defense Department. That is nothing in
                    the drug business. The drug traffickers could fly it out there, bring in a
                    generator that cost them $200 or $300, put some gasoline in it, spot the
                    frequencies, turn on another radio that probably didn't cost more than a couple
                    of thousand dollars, and listen. It's not that difficult and it's not very
                    expensive, particularly when you're selling stuff which is bringing in hundreds
                    of millions of dollars. It's not difficult to operate the equipment, either,
                    since it is so automated. If you have a serious problem, you just bring in
                    another radio. Don't even bother trying to fix the old one.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>We had some problems putting together information from various sources. Some of
                    it came from confidential informants who may have known when something was going
                    to be picked up. The pick up would be in a general area. We wouldn't know
                    exactly where and we didn't know exactly where it was going to be taken to. We
                    generally had aerial surveys. We had some old information that we had managed to
                    assemble. We concluded that one of the reasons that we were hitting so many dry
                    holes was that we were not doing what the fusing the information efficiently.
                    That is, the information from the various sources wasn't being integrated the
                    right way and quickly enough to be effective.</p>
                <p>So I set up an Intelligence Fusion Unit. The DEA, which was theoretically in
                    control of this operation, insisted that only its people should be in the
                    Intelligence Fusion Unit. I told them that there would have to be others in the
                    unit. Then the head of the DEA unit in the Embassy had a lot of difficulty with
                    his chiefs in Washington, who wanted to make sure that this operation had a DEA
                    stamp all over it. It was big news in the US when it was reported on television
                    and on the front pages of the newspapers. DEA wanted the credit, and I gave them
                    a lot of the credit. However, DEA is mostly made up of policemen. They're not
                    strategic intelligence people. Their tactical approach tends to be limited to
                    carrying out a raid against something. It doesn't contemplate a carefully
                    sequenced series of raids over a period of three or four months.</p>
                <p>I got some help from General Galvin, who sent me a couple of non commissioned
                    officers from the Intelligence Corps. Their job basically was to administer the
                    Intelligence Fusion Unit. I think that I told the DEA that they would have to
                    take that instead of being allowed to put it together all by themselves.</p>
                <p>We saw an immediate increase in hot spots instead of dry holes. We still had a
                    lot of dry holes. This was inevitable, but the ratio of successful operations
                    went up. When the US Army helicopters were pulled out and were replaced by the
                    State Department provided helicopters, we also let the Intelligence Corps NCO's
                    go back to SOUTHCOM, because by that time the intelligence fusion system had
                    been established. It was working, people felt comfortable with it, and the
                    people we had there on permanent assignment could do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But with the raids going in, when we had our military
                        people there, did they have to fight to get in to the hot spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. First of all, the helicopters were carrying Bolivian Anti-Drug Police
                    who had been trained in small-unit military tactics — jungle tactics. The
                    helicopters would have to go into some open spot nearby where they could land.
                    They would try to go in as close as they could to land without being heard.
                    Because even if they touched down only 100 yards from the lab, if they were
                    heard coming in, the drug traffickers could scatter into the jungle and you
                    would get nothing much. The drug traffickers might even take the coca paste. We
                    might get some equipment but we mightn't get much else.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>So the Bolivian Anti-Drug Police had to go in quietly. We bought a bunch of
                    inflatable rafts because the northern part of Bolivia is full of rivers in the
                    jungle area. That's where the labs were. So the helicopters would go in. The
                    Bolivian Police would jump out, and the helicopters would immediately withdraw
                    to a distance that we regarded as safe. They would wait there until they
                    received a signal to come back to recover the Bolivian Police. The Bolivian
                    Police were accompanied by DEA agents to provide technical guidance. If they
                    could walk through the trees to the lab target, that was fine. If the lab was on
                    a river, which was often the case, they would inflate the rafts and go down as
                    close as they could, sneak in, and conduct the raid. Carrying stuff out was too
                    difficult, so they destroyed everything that they found after taking photos and
                    making a rough written inventory. If they could capture somebody who was working
                    there, they would interrogate the person.</p>
                <p>Operations of this kind had a serious effect on the financial return to the
                    peasants who grew coca. Remember, all of that coca paste that the Bolivian
                    Anti-Drug Police destroyed at these labs had been produced at the expense of the
                    peasants. When the paste was destroyed, no money came from it, and the peasants
                    weren't paid.</p>
                <p>Destroying functioning labs had to be useful, we thought. But how long would it
                    take to replace them? Maybe two to three weeks — no time at all, since the drug
                    traffickers had the money to buy the gear. So it was an unending process.</p>
                <p>We brought in the State Department helicopters, we lent them to the Bolivian Air
                    Force, and we entered into a contract with the Bell Helicopter Company to have
                    civilian American-managed maintenance and support so that the helicopters would
                    continue to be safe to fly. The DEA people worked very closely with the
                    helicopter unit to protect the Bolivian Air Force people from drug abuse — that
                    is, from being suborned by the drug traffickers.</p>
                <p>I want to emphasize something else here. The Bolivian Armed Forces were
                    determined to stay out of the anti-drug business. They had had a very bad time
                    during the early 1980's when a general, who had later become President of
                    Bolivia, was implicated in the drug traffic. This involvement in the drug
                    traffic had corrupted the armed forces. It had hurt internal discipline and
                    unity in the armed forces. In effect, it was tearing apart an institution that
                    meant a great deal to the people who were in it. They said that the problem was
                    that they had let the armed forces get involved in the drug traffic. They didn't
                    want to have any part of being in the anti-drug effort.</p>
                <p>So, to protect them, we never told the Bolivian pilots where they were going to
                    fly until they had been in the air for some time. After the US Army helicopters
                    had been withdrawn, every one of the State Department helicopters that had been
                    provided to the Bolivian Air Force had a DEA agent on board. The DEA agents knew
                    where they were going and had a route plotted out. Typically, the initial
                    heading had nothing to do with the ultimate destination.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>When we were first doing Operation Blast Furnace, we had fuel bladders [large,
                    collapsible, rubber fuel containers developed for the US Air Force] which we
                    flew in DC-3's to remote areas of Bolivia for refueling. The helicopters would
                    take off from a central location, they would go out to a refueling point, and
                    then they would go off somewhere else. That gave them much longer legs endurance
                    and a less predictable radius of operations. DEA also had fixed-wing aircraft
                    and fuel bladders. We knew where we were going. But the helicopter pilots would
                    take off and land, only to discover that it was a refueling spot.</p>
                <p>You could never ask anybody in the Bolivian Air Force, “Where or when are you
                    going?” By agreement with the Bolivian authorities, didn't tell the pilots
                    anything. They were simply told that they had to be at the airport, on duty,
                    near the helicopters, every morning at a certain hour. If they were going to
                    fly, they were kept incommunicado after they reported to the helicopter pad. If
                    they weren't going to fly, they were incommunicado for the same couple of hours.
                    We did various things to protect the Bolivian air crews as well as to protect
                    the integrity of the operation.</p>
                <p>Because of the way the drug money flowed, we discovered that if we could
                    interrupt the operations of the small aircraft that were hauling cash back into
                    Bolivia, that really made a mess, and was a loss to the campesinos who produced
                    the coca. They operated on a cash basis. So we tried to interdict these pressure
                    points. AID [Agency for International Development] offered alternative crops to
                    the peasants, technical advice, and fertilizers. We set up a nursery in the main
                    valley where the largest amount of coca was being grown. We had on display all
                    of the plants which the peasants would be given to grow substitute crops, with
                    technicians there to tell them exactly how to work with them.</p>
                <p>For years AID had been running nurseries in Central America to help Central
                    American farmers diversify their crops. It had nothing to do with the drug
                    traffic. However, we were able to draw on the output from the well-established
                    Central American nurseries to bring in plants. So we had a ready source.</p>
                <p>Then we set up a program to help in the establishment of health clinics and
                    schools and to help to provide safe water and decent roads in the coca growing
                    area. But these services were to be delivered only if the campesinos first
                    destroyed the coca plantations. Of course, we had to persuade campesinos — whose
                    long experiences with government had taught them to disbelieve all government
                    promises — that we really could and would deliver the promised services if they
                    would destroy their coca plants. For example, we would put some equipment at the
                    edge of the valley, but it didn't operate until the farmers started to chop down
                    their coca. If we didn't see the coca being destroyed in a given area, there
                    would be no school, no health clinic, no safe water, and no roads. If all of the
                    farmers in a given area cooperated in destroying their coca, they got the whole
                    works. They either got everything or they didn't get anything. However, the
                    ability to deliver was physically placed where they could see it.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>The Bolivian Government had said that they would pay the farmers for cutting down
                    the coca. Payment was intended partly to provide capital to tide them over until
                    an alternative legitimate crop could start producing returns. Our government
                    said that paying the campesinos amounted to paying for sin and wouldn't have
                    anything to do with it. The Bolivian Government, on its side, said that it was
                    going to take its own resources and pay the farmers to destroy their coca
                    plants. I had a war with Washington over that because they wanted to stop the
                    whole program. I told the Washington agencies that they were crazy. The elected,
                    Bolivian Government was trying to get their people out of the one cash crop [i.
                    e., coca] that provided the farmer with a reasonable assurance that he would
                    have an income. There were no other crops in Bolivia that provided that degree
                    of assurance. I said that asserting overriding problems of sin and evil in
                    Washington wasn't going to stop the production of coca in Bolivia.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the Bolivian Government did send people down to coca growing areas with
                    the money to pay the peasants to stop growing coca. They would set up tables in
                    the open fields and say to the peasants, “Here's the money” if you stop growing
                    coca. Obviously, they had armed guards around them. Survey engineers would also
                    be on hand. If a farmer said, “I think that I am interested,” the survey
                    engineer could go out with the farmer. The farmer would say, “This is my crop
                    and this is my land.” The survey engineer would measure it and certify that
                    there was so much land involved. The farmers were paid by the hectare for
                    chopping down the coca. The engineer would say, “Well, when the coca is cut
                    down, call me back.” The peasants would cut it down, the survey engineer would
                    go back and say, “Yes, it's been cut down.” The farmer would go back to the
                    table and get his money.</p>
                <p>You had to be that physical about providing evidence of your good faith. Simply
                    promising the peasants that there was going to be a program had no effect at
                    all. There have been so many programs in the history of Bolivia that nobody
                    believes in programs as programs that work.</p>
                <p>We had problems because the Bolivian Government was convinced that perhaps
                    one-third of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) depended on the cash arriving in
                    the drug trafficker aircraft. I estimated that not more than half of the total
                    economy was in the money economy. The rest of the economy involved the use of
                    barter arrangements. If one-third of the money economy was drug-dependent, that
                    represented one-sixth of the GDP, still a hefty share. The Bolivian Government
                    was going through a terrible time, fiscally and financially. They were afraid
                    that everything that they were trying to do restore economic health, a
                    market-based economy and a strong legitimate private sector would collapse if we
                    succeeded in eradicating the production of coca.</p>
                <p>So the Economic Section of the Embassy worked closely with the World Bank, the
                    IMF [International Monetary Fund], the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB],
                    and the Bolivian Government itself to track the fiscal health of the money
                    economy to try to make sure that it didn't collapse.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>The Political Section worked closely with all of its contacts to encourage
                    passage of a coca eradication law. The Bolivian Congress passed such a law.</p>
                <p>USIS [the United States Information Service] worked closely with the media in the
                    field of public diplomacy, pointing out the damage that drug consumption was
                    doing to Bolivia and to Bolivian families.</p>
                <p>First, the US military carried out Operation Blast Furnace, and then they
                    provided some continuing assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Operation Blast Furnace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Operation Blast Furnace was the operation involving US Army helicopters,
                    flown by US Army pilots. That was the name of the operation.</p>
                <p>The US military worked with the Bolivian Air Force and eventually with the
                    Bolivian Navy. We brought in US Coast Guard people to help the Bolivian Navy
                    conduct river patrols.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this amount to? Bolivia does not exactly have a
                        Two Ocean Navy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. However, Bolivia had had Antofagasta, now in Chile, as a seaport and
                    a substantial stretch of the Pacific Coast of South America until it lost the
                    War of the Pacific to Chile in 1879. It has retained a Navy, with naval
                    officers, ever since to symbolize its right of access to the Pacific Ocean.
                    However, there are large areas of Bolivia where there are no all-weather roads
                    and surface transportation depends on Bolivia's rivers. The Navy operates river
                    patrols.</p>
                <p>Virtually everybody in the Embassy was engaged in the anti-coca effort. This was
                    a highly coordinated effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>How successful was it? We successfully encouraged the Bolivian Congress to pass
                    the anti-coca law. We slowed down and, for a period, stopped, the increase in
                    acreage planted to coca. But, for every hectare that was cut down, another
                    hectare was planted to coca somewhere else, so we didn't get very far on that.
                    We were able substantially to increase the risk of growing coca. That meant that
                    the drug traffickers had to pay a little bit more for it than they had been
                    accustomed to paying — but not enough to make a huge difference. We persuaded
                    the professional and upper classes of Bolivia that they were paying a horrible
                    social price by having drug production in their country. They were in a period
                    of denial, and we broke through that. They understood that their kids were being
                    destroyed. They understood that there were young children — particularly boys —
                    being abandoned all over the country, who were then being turned into permanent
                    social problems.</p>
                <p>These boys would be picked up by people who would hire them to stomp on coca
                    leaves in maceration pits where the alkaloid was leached from the leaves. The
                    boys would do it in their bare feet. They were promised pay, but the pay they
                    were given was a coca paste cigarette. In theory, they could go off, sell these
                    things, and have some money. In fact, they just smoked the stuff. The material
                    used to leach the alkaloids was any petroleum-based solvent. The preferred
                    solvent was kerosene, but you could use gasoline. Sometimes, when kerosene was
                    in short supply, they used leaded gasoline. Then, when the boys smoked this coca
                    paste cigarette, they also inhaled lead, which makes a mess of the nervous
                    system. They were getting hundreds of kids, ranging in age from 8 to 12,
                    stomping the coca leaves. Within six months they were like zombies. They
                    couldn't work, and they wouldn't die. This was a permanent, social sore. It was
                    just horrible. Bolivia awoke to what that danger meant, and there was a real
                    turn around in the attitudes of Bolivian professional and upper class
                    people.</p>
                <p>However, all of our efforts didn't affect the street price of cocaine in the US.
                    They didn't really affect the total flow of drugs to the US. So that's the way
                    it is. I drew my own sense of satisfaction from knowing that the Bolivians
                    themselves are sufficiently alarmed that maybe we would save a lot of children.
                    But I didn't kid myself about having changed the US and the drug problem in the
                    US. That sense, was a disappointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the fact that, despite our having
                        made this great effort, we were probably THE major market for cocaine. In
                        many ways the real failure is that we have not been able to control our own
                        society. Here you were, asking another country to try to help us help our
                        problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It's never bothered me to ask for help. I don't feel ashamed to ask for
                    help from anyone who can give it to me. I don't think that the US should be
                    ashamed to ask for help from a poor Bolivian Indian, if that's what it comes to.
                    If the US can pay for the help, I think that the US should do so — even more so,
                    if the US can give some real, human help in return. That's the way people should
                    behave toward each other. People should treat each other with dignity. It
                    doesn't make any difference if one person has no shoes, and the other one is
                    wearing patent leather. They might both be very smart. They might live in
                    different circumstances, but they're going to have to make do as well as they
                    can, given their relative situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would apply in any country, but in Bolivia I think
                        that it would be particularly up to you. We were doing everything we could
                        to defeat the drug traffic. We understood the political ramifications
                        locally about the coca growers and all of that. However, in the United
                        States a major crop that we sell is deadly. And that is tobacco. Yet one of
                        the reasons that we continue to produce and market tobacco, both internally
                        and in terms of exports, is the fact that the tobacco lobby is so powerful.
                        Did you ever give any particular thought to this particular subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. I thought about it but I never had to deal with it professionally. I
                    was never at a post or in a place where, somehow or another, American tobacco
                    exporters were suffering because of something that would require US Government
                    intervention. In fact, except for my service in Western Europe, I was never in a
                    place that didn't grow enough of its own tobacco to take care of itself. Well,
                    Honduras was a bit different, but this comment applies to the other countries. I
                    never had to make any representations on this subject. I don't smoke and never
                    have. I'm not enthusiastic about tobacco and I'm not enthusiastic about having
                    US taxpayers subsidizing tobacco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, beside the drug effort, were there any other...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Let me go on a bit further into this subject, because you raised the
                    question of corruption. Of course, what is corruption? It is very difficult to
                    deal with. However, the presence of corruption also reveals the presence of
                    uncorrupt people, who are very serious about this subject. For example, drug
                    traffickers would try to persuade crew members of the Bolivian National Airlines
                    to carry drugs into Miami. We monitored that subject very, very closely and very
                    tightly, in very discreet ways. We did not have anyone climbing on board the
                    aircraft in Bolivia, checking everything out, or going through people's pockets.
                    We did nothing like that. We discovered, frankly through confidential
                    informants, that substantial numbers of Bolivian Airlines crewpeople adamantly
                    and consistently refused to do anything at all for the drug traffickers. They
                    wouldn't touch drugs.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>There was a terrible time recruiting police officers to head the Anti-Drug
                    Police. What would happen is that a police officer would be brought in, he would
                    spend two or three months on the job, and the drug traffickers would be able to
                    reach him. Now people immediately assume that there was a big payoff here, and
                    everybody has a price. That's too easy. That's sort of a comic strip approach to
                    the matter.</p>
                <p>What would happen is that the Bolivian Police officer involved would discover a
                    picture of his child or his wife in his mailbox one day. It might be a Polaroid
                    picture. The picture would let the police officer know that they knew where the
                    members of his family were and when they were vulnerable. Next the police
                    officer would get a telephone call from someone who would say, “You're going to
                    get another picture in the mailbox.” And more pictures would arrive. Finally, a
                    message would come saying, “Don't go to the office next Monday. Be at home,
                    sick. If you're not in the office next Monday, there will be a substantial
                    reward for you. If you are at the office, take a look at this picture.”</p>
                <p>So what the guy was being told was to call in sick. Nothing more complicated than
                    that. If he didn't call in sick, something was going to happen to his family. If
                    he did call in sick, the typical payoff would be worth 10 years' salary.</p>
                <p>Now, I knew some of these police officers. I'm persuaded that they feared for
                    their families — nothing else. I don't know how you beat that kind of corrupting
                    pressure. Perhaps you beat it by arranging things so that people being targeted
                    have such limited power, influence, or foreknowledge of what's going on that
                    they're not worth corrupting. But that didn't happen, of course, to the guy
                    actually running the Anti-Drug Police.</p>
                <p>I've told you how the labs operate. They function briefly and for a short time.
                    So things could go along for two or three months, and nobody would care. Then
                    there would come a time when the drug traffickers were going to fly in the
                    money, fly out the coca paste, or bring in the precursor chemical, whatever it
                    might be. All that the drug traffickers wanted was a clear time window. It
                    didn't have to be very big. A few hours on a given day and a few more hours on a
                    day two or three days later, plus a few more hours in scattered spots over the
                    following week. That's all the drug traffickers needed.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>So there was a constant turnover of officers running that Anti-Drug Police Corps,
                    the way kids run through ice cream in the summer. They would be there for two or
                    three months, and then you would need to change them again. This process went on
                    over and over again. I don't remember the names of any of them and I wouldn't
                    want to, because I just don't feel that they were guilty or did anything
                    criminal. They were caught in a very difficult position. I often asked myself,
                    “What would happen if my daughter and wife were targeted in such a way that I
                    knew absolutely that the drug traffickers would get them. And if somebody said
                    to me, “All I want you to do is to stay home from work, and your child and your
                    wife will be all right. If you go to work, maybe you will never see them
                    again—or you'll see them maimed. Brutally maimed, but not dead.” Anybody who
                    wants to criticize people who've been suborned by the drug traffickers should
                    put themselves in the same position. Especially when you're 7,000 miles away
                    from the scene. When you're on the spot, you have to think about it. You have to
                    think of ways of getting these police officers off the spot. Otherwise, the
                    anti-drug operations won't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the American staff in the Embassy? Were you
                        targeted yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Two or three times I received information that I was being targeted. Not
                    very frequently. I had substantial personal protection, as did my wife. We had a
                    bodyguard. Whenever we left the Embassy Residence, whatever the time of day or
                    whatever day of the week, there was a bodyguard there. Even if we went to a
                    movie theater. Even if it was an unannounced trip to the movies, decided on
                    without notice. The need to guard us was so stringent that I was advised not to
                    take a personal automobile to Bolivia, because I wouldn't be allowed to ride
                    around in it. I rode in armored Embassy vehicles.</p>
                <p>At one stage a prominent, Bolivian naturalist stumbled on a major drug
                    laboratory. He was murdered by people guarding the laboratory. People went out
                    to find his airplane and spotted it from the air. It had been destroyed on the
                    ground to make it appear as if it had crashed. Somebody landed a light airplane
                    near his plane. When they got there, they noticed that the laboratory was there,
                    because between the time that the naturalist was murdered and his airplane
                    destroyed, other people started taking out some of the equipment from the
                    laboratory.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>The Minister of the Interior phoned me when it first came up. It was a Saturday
                    night. He asked if we could launch the US Army helicopters. This was during the
                    time of Operation Blast Furnace, when we still had helicopters with US Army
                    crews on them. The Bolivians wanted to take police out to the site of the
                    murder. It was in an extremely remote area. To get the helicopters there would
                    have required two refueling landings en route. It took us too long — 36 hours—
                    to get the Bolivian anti-drug police there. When they finally arrived, the lab
                    was still there with tons of precursor chemicals. It was a huge setup. However,
                    all of the drug traffickers were gone, and some of the other equipment was gone.
                    I called in a demolition team from Panama. They rigged it for destruction.
                    However, the Minister of the Interior held up the destruction. After three and a
                    half weeks, I had to pull the demolition team back, because I couldn't keep them
                    at this site. Eventually, the order was given to destroy the site. However,
                    nobody has any idea how much of it was actually destroyed and how much of it was
                    carted off in the meantime. When it was destroyed, it still made a big fire.</p>
                <p>This incident damaged the reputation of the Minister of the Interior in the eyes
                    of the international community — to such an extent that a number of governments
                    were worried about corruption. I'm not saying that he was corrupt. I'm just
                    saying that the way things worked, it created the wrong appearance, so he
                    resigned his post and left the government. That's the closest I came to the
                    question of drug-related corruption inside the government. Again, I'm not saying
                    that the Minister was corrupt. I'm just saying that it had the wrong
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>It was nothing like the experience we had before and we've had since then in
                    Colombia. Nothing like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning some of the other things that you did
                        during the time you were in Bolivia. Was small business one of these
                        matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. I wanted to talk a little bit about some really successful US
                    programs in Bolivia. One of them involved a small loan program. The idea wasn't
                    mine. It came from the Director of the AID [Agency for International
                    Development] Mission. Actually the concept had been around for two or three
                    decades, so it wasn't new. The idea was this. We would hire a Non Governmental
                    Organization (NGO) to come in and set up small loan circles. The organizers
                    basically recruit people who are at the poorest levels of society — typically,
                    in an urban environment, where the economy is a money and not a barter economy.
                    They organize them into mutual borrowing groups. Each group has from four to six
                    people. The members of each group are required to attend a course which teaches
                    them how to do simple bookkeeping, so that they know what prices they have to
                    charge to make a profit. Stated differently, they also learn at what point
                    they're making a loss and when they should just get out of the business, if they
                    can't do any better than that. It was very elementary.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>Then you make them loans. In economies like that of Bolivia the typical starting
                    loan was $50 for three months. If the repayments are being made on time, you can
                    double the credit line to $100 for the fourth through sixth month. You can
                    increase it again by another $50 for the sixth through ninth month. We had a
                    maximum of $500 which could be loaned out to any one borrower at any one
                    time.</p>
                <p>In the Bolivian case we hired a Boston organization called “Action,” or “Accion”
                    [in Spanish], to run the program.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 7, Side A, of the interview with Ambassador
                        Ed Rowell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Confederation of Bolivian Private Entrepreneurs pledged to provide
                    the administrative support for three years at the end of which, if the program
                    was working, interest on the loans would provide enough money to sustain the
                    program indefinitely. AID provided the seed capital for the loans
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>When I went through AID's program plans before they went to Washington for
                    approval, I discussed this aspect of the plan with the AID Director, who had
                    $500,000 committed to this program. I said, “Well, do you think this is going to
                    work?” He said he thought that it had a good chance. I said that I thought it
                    had a good chance to work and, moreover, if it did work in its pilot phase in La
                    Paz, we were going to want to extend it. However, we didn't know how many
                    participants we were going to get, but I said, “Make the first year's seed money
                    $750,000.” The AID Director didn't have any additional seed money planned for
                    succeeding years. I said that I wanted another $1.0 million ready in the second
                    year in case we could extend the program more rapidly outside of the city of La
                    Paz. If the pilot phase in La Paz didn't work, we could easily reallocate that
                    $1.0 million or give it back to Washington. However, if this program did work, I
                    wanted to catch the momentum and make it take off.</p>
                <p>I monitored that program very closely. We got it started, for example, with
                    Indian women who sold fruits in the local street markets. They pick up the fruit
                    at a big truck stop at the edge of the city of La Paz in the early morning.
                    Typically, they were given a sack of fruit by a truck driver, who was the middle
                    man. He would tell the women selling the fruit, “Here's your sack of fruit for
                    today, and you've got to bring me $20 by tonight, or you won't get another sack
                    of fruit tomorrow morning.” If the women could sell the fruit for more than $20,
                    they got to keep the difference. If they fell short, they owed the truck driver
                    out of future earnings. If they just broke even, they didn't make anything for
                    themselves, although I guess that they could eat some of the fruit.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>Under this small loan program, one of these women would borrow $50. She would go
                    to the truck, as usual. The truck driver would hand her the sack of fruit. She
                    would start to pick out the best oranges. The truck driver would say, “Hey, take
                    the sack and go. $20 is the charge.” She would say, “No, here are the $20, and I
                    get the fruit that I want.” He would say, “Hey, wait a minute.” Of course, there
                    were trucks all over the place. The woman would say, “I think that I can get
                    fruit from 'Juan' over there,” two trucks away. She would say, “Do you want the
                    $20?” — which she would wave in his face. She got what she wanted.</p>
                <p>The Indian women doubled their daily net income in two and a half weeks. They met
                    their loan obligations under the program. Then they doubled their money again.
                    There was a huge return on the money they had borrowed. Of course, the truckers,
                    the middle men, were seeing their income shrink somewhat, but they still were
                    doing very well.</p>
                <p>The program had a by-product which we hadn't anticipated but which delighted us.
                    We lent money to people in the poor parts of La Paz who were trying to set up or
                    run mini-businesses — a bicycle repair shop or “factory” making little tin ovens
                    for homes. The person setting up a bicycle repair shop would get a $50 loan, lay
                    in some spare parts, and buy some tools. One of the first things that he or she
                    did was to hire some kid to be repair assistants, so that they could repair the
                    bicycles more efficiently and do a lot more of them more quickly.</p>
                <p>The employment effects of this program were startling and came right up on the
                    employment statistics collected by the Bolivian Government. It was amazing. We
                    hadn't anticipated this, but it was a very good thing to have happen. It was
                    particularly welcome because of the mass unemployment related to the collapse of
                    mining and the tin industry.We made 2,000 of these small loans during the first
                    year. There was not one single default. Not one. There were people who couldn't
                    make their repayments, but the guarantors within their small borrowing circle of
                    four to six people covered for them until they could repay.</p>
                <p>And there was something else. At the end of the year we appraised every aspect of
                    the program. We made a fortunate discovery. We looked at all of the people whom
                    Accion had hired to be organizers of these small loan groups. We had hired
                    teachers who were out of work, lawyers who didn't have enough business and who
                    were moonlighting on the side, recent university graduates, tobacco shop
                    employees, traveling salesmen—all kinds of people. We looked to see which ones
                    had been most successful. Success was measured in the number of groups organized
                    and in the strength of the groups in terms of their ability to make the
                    repayments. We were stunned. We discovered that people who had been traveling
                    salesmen produced anywhere from two to five times as many successes as any of
                    the other people. That meant that we had discovered the key to expanding the
                    program rapidly to other cities in Bolivia, because we knew exactly whom we
                    needed to hire to get things started elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>As originally conceived, the program was to run for perhaps five or six years
                    before we went very far outside of the city of La Paz. Well, by the end of the
                    second year, we were operating in seven cities. It was a wonderfully success.
                    Even on the basis of administrative costs, it broke even by the end of two years
                    and well before the third year. The people borrowing money under the program
                    paid real interest rates on their loans and had a real rate of return above the
                    rate of inflation. They understood that what they were paying was an interest
                    rate. Remember, these were people who didn't own land. Under the traditional
                    banking system in Bolivia they could never have gotten loans from the banks. If
                    they had, the interest rates would have been substantially higher than they were
                    under this program.</p>
                <p>What does a program like that do? I've already told you about the employment and
                    income effect. It also reinforced the people's commitment to a market economy
                    and to the free enterprise system. When that system succeeds, their commitments
                    to democracy became much stronger as well. I regarded that as one of the most
                    successful programs that we ever had in Bolivia. I've heard that programs like
                    this have had comparable success elsewhere in the world.</p>

                        man. Was it his idea to hire the extra boy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. It was entirely his initiative and his idea. He was able to do it
                    because he had this loan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But nobody was sitting there saying, “Well, if you do
                        this, you can do this or that. If you think this can help you, here's some
                        money.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: We didn't do that. The only thing that we taught him in our courses was
                    how to keep books and how to understand whether he had a real business or just a
                    rathole. However, he had to understand his own business and he had to manage it.
                    The bicycle repairman, the Indian market woman — it made no difference. We
                    didn't tell them how to handle their businesses. They did it.</p>
                <p>Regarding the Food for Peace program, I told you earlier about miners out of
                    work. We put them to work using Food for Peace resources, putting in major
                    improvements in terms of water supply and minor improvements in transport in
                    their villages. This program took up some slack in the economy and assured poor
                    families that they would have food at a time when Bolivia wasn't prepared to
                    absorb the volume of unemployment resulting from the changes in the economy
                    which the government was making. They kept their dignity, they made real
                    improvements in their infrastructure, they maintained their health and their
                    ability to hold jobs.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>This program was a success, and it certainly did a lot of good for the US. There
                    were no towns, even small towns, in that country which didn't know that the US
                    was anxious to help ordinary people by helping them to help themselves through
                    the Food for Peace program. It was very good.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: That's it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Bolivia in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I left Bolivia in January, 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I went to Portugal. My wife and I had gone home to the US to spend
                    Christmas of 1987. We were at a house in Rehoboth, Delaware with our children
                    when George Vest, the Director General of the Foreign Service, telephoned me in
                    Rehoboth and asked if I would be willing to go to Lisbon. I said, “This is kind
                    of sudden.” He said, “It's very sudden. I need your answer now.” I said, “Can I
                    talk it over with my wife? What's involved?” He said, “If your answer is 'yes,'
                    the Secretary of State [George Shultz at the time] will talk to the President
                    and ask him to make a 'recess appointment,' so you can get there right away.
                    We've had no Ambassador in Lisbon for over a year. A number of problems have
                    arisen because we don't have an Ambassador. We need to get you there right now.
                    This is the time frame. We'll make a recess appointment now and you can be
                    confirmed later. However, we'll have an Ambassador there.”</p>
                <p>Well, I discussed the appointment with our children. I discussed it with a head
                    hunter who had me in mind for a very attractive position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A head hunter is...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>ROWELL: An executive recruiter. I had been in touch with him because I figured
                    that I had been an Ambassador and that was likely to be the final assignment of
                    my Foreign Service career. Very likely, I might not get another Embassy. So I
                    had started my job search. I was then in the third year of my assignment to
                    Bolivia, and, typically, three years would complete the assignment. So I had a
                    job offer in Washington, which was interesting and remunerative. Another
                    possibility, the one involving the head hunter, would have been even more
                    remunerative in Southern California. A lot of trade-offs were involved. So my
                    wife, our children and I took a long three-hour walk on the wintery beach
                    discussing the pro's and con's. Then I went back to the house and called George
                    Vest. I said that I would go as Ambassador to Portugal.</p>
                <p>So, right after Christmas, 1987—in fact, on January 2, 1988, my wife and I flew
                    back to Bolivia. I told the Bolivian President what was happening. I left
                    Bolivia 10 days later on January 12, 1988, stopped in Washington for 48 hours to
                    be sworn in as Ambassador to Portugal under a recess appointment, and went off
                    to Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us a little feel for the Washington
                        environment at the time? Why had there been a year's lapse in assigning an
                        Ambassador to Portugal? Normally, Portugal would be a place, if nowhere
                        else, that a friend of the President's could end up in, or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: A person had been nominated to go to Lisbon. In fact, he was a career
                    Foreign Service Officer. Some questions had arisen, and the nomination had
                    become very controversial. Frankly, I had been in Bolivia and hadn't been paying
                    any attention to the controversy. I knew vaguely that it had been going on since
                    early in 1987. When Congress recessed in December, 1987, the nomination died,
                    and the President's options were either to resubmit the name of the same person,
                    and probably go through another year without an Ambassador, or to nominate
                    somebody else. Because the whole process of confirmation is rather slow, if the
                    President had waited for me to be confirmed, we would have been without an
                    Ambassador to Portugal for another six to eight months. The Department of State
                    and the Defense Department felt that our relationship with Portugal was
                    important partly because of the use of Lajes air base in the Azores, partly
                    because Portugal was completing its transition to a modern, democratic, Western
                    European market economy integrated into the European Union. So that meant
                    selecting somebody who was already in the Executive Branch, with a full security
                    clearance, and saying to that person, “You go to Portugal as Ambassador now
                    before the Senate resumes session at the end of January so that the
                    constitutional requirements for a recess appointment are met.” The situation was
                    made to order for a career officer, someone who can be plugged into a hole when
                    you're desperate for a quick plug. I was the one whom they called.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>At the time there were probably only about three career officers in the Foreign
                    Service who had comparable fluency in Portuguese as I did, who already knew
                    enough about Portugal not to require much briefing, and who already had an
                    established a set of relationships there that could be used immediately to deal
                    with the problems that had festered for so long. So I went to Lisbon.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Lisbon—I don't recall the exact date. It was in January, 1988,
                    before the Congress reconvened. I presented my credentials within a week,
                    extraordinarily quickly by Portuguese standards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an agenda of what needed to be done in
                        Portugal, either one that had been made up in advance or just by quickly
                        briefing yourself on the situation in Portugal? You'd been away from
                        Portugal for three or four years, there had been a hiatus of more than one
                        year since your immediate predecessor left, and things had changed so much
                        in Portugal since then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The top issue on the agenda was US use of Lajes air force base and the
                    renewal of the agreement that permitted that use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lajes air force base is in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Azores. The agreement that permitted US use of the air base had
                    already expired. We were still using Lajes air force base on sufferance, but the
                    sufferance was growing thin. The Portuguese had made it quite plain that one of
                    the problems in arranging for an extension of the agreement was the absence of
                    an American Ambassador in Lisbon. We had an excellent Charg� d'Affaires there,
                    Wes Egan, who is now our Ambassador to Jordan. But the Portuguese wanted an
                    Ambassador, not just a Charg� d'Affaires. It made a big difference to them. So
                    the use of Lajes air force base was the first issue. It was the issue which was
                    the most consuming during my first year there as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>There were some other issues related to Portugal's entry into the European
                    Community. When Portugal entered the European Community, our sales of
                    agricultural commodities to Portugal fell by more than half. I think that I
                    mentioned that earlier in this interview. We were beginning to have some
                    problems with the European Community in continuing the trade compensation that
                    had been offered to the US to offset the loss of sales of agricultural
                    commodities in Portugal. Portugal was beginning to boom as a result of
                    investments flowing in from the European Community. A number of US businesses
                    were beginning to wonder about trade opportunities in Portugal. Some significant
                    business opportunities were beginning to open up. For example, Portugal planned
                    to expand its electricity generating capacity. Would American companies have a
                    chance either to build the plants or provide the fuel? Those were the most
                    critical elements on the agenda.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Apart from that, there was the problem of trying to stamp out civil war in Angola
                    and Mozambique. Remember that the Soviet Union and the Cubans were still there,
                    fueling their part of the war. There was a permanent watch, in Portugal as well
                    as in other countries, designed to restrict weapons deliveries to rogue
                    states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we stop at this point, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. To recapitulate, the main issue in the portfolio when I arrived in
                    Portugal in 1988 as American Ambassador was restoration of Portuguese confidence
                    in the US as an ally and interested party. They felt that we had lost interest
                    in Portugal because we had not had an Ambassador there for over 13 months. The
                    absence of an American Ambassador was due entirely to political controversy in
                    Washington and specific controversies regarding the nominee. The Portuguese,
                    ever in the European conspiracy mode of thought, believed that there must have
                    been some issue in this delay in the appointment of a US Ambassador related to
                    Portugal as well. So it was restoring their confidence in us.</p>
                <p>There was also the matter of sustaining our continued use of Lajes air base in
                    the Azores. There was also the matter of trying to find ways to enable US
                    investments and US international commodity brokers to take advantage of new
                    openings in Portugal because of its involvement in the European Union. There was
                    also the matter of putting the final touches on recovering markets lost because
                    of Portugal's entry into the European Union. Those markets had provided us with
                    almost $600 million annually in agricultural sales. For example, in the late
                    1970's and early 1980's it was $600 million per year. When I returned to
                    Portugal, our agricultural sales were about $300 million per year. The
                    difference was due to membership in the European Union. We've already discussed
                    the nuclear non-proliferation watch, as well as the effort to find peace in
                    Angola and Mozambique. This effort involved a lot of discussion with the Soviets
                    while I was there in Lisbon.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 25, 1996. This is a continuation of the
                        interview with Ambassador Ed Rowell. In the first place, I recall that there
                        was a problem between Senator Jesse Helms [Republican, North Carolina] and
                        Dick Viets. Was it Dick Viets who was originally nominated as Ambassador to
                        Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It was Dick Viets. He had been our Ambassador to Jordan and was nominated
                    around January, 1987, to be our Ambassador to Portugal. However, the nomination
                    went nowhere. I was in Bolivia during all of 1987 until I came back to the US to
                    spend Christmas with my family. Frankly, I hadn't paid any attention to what was
                    happening on ambassadorial nominations and not much attention to who was in
                    Lisbon. So I can't tell you very much about the nature of the controversy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, and I may be mistaken, and somebody can do
                        some research on this, Dick Viets had given some poor personnel ratings to
                        some of his junior officers who were unhappy with them, or something like
                        that. Somehow, this became a cause for Senator Jesse Helms. Did the fact
                        that there had been a controversy over the former Ambassador-designate spill
                        over onto you, or were you just sort of pulled in from left field and so
                        didn't have the same problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I came in from left field. When the Congressional session ended, the
                    Viets nomination died. He would have had to be renominated to be considered
                    during 1988. The Executive Branch concluded that the nomination was dead, and
                    Viets himself asked that his name be withdrawn. That was in December, 1987. Then
                    the decision that faced the President and Secretary of State George Shultz was
                    whether to find somebody else, nominate that person, and put him or her through
                    the usual, confirmation process. That would have cost at least another six to
                    eight months before we would have an Ambassador in Lisbon after having had a
                    hiatus of over 12 months. Or, would they make a recess appointment? If they made
                    a recess appointment, then it had to be somebody whose security clearance was
                    already valid and who, they could be confident, did not have some hidden
                    skeleton about to leap out of the closet. That really dictated a career Foreign
                    Service Officer as Ambassador to Portugal. The choice was limited in terms of
                    people who spoke Portuguese and who already had a basis of relationships to try
                    to dig ourselves out of the hole we had gotten ourselves into with the
                    Portuguese.</p>
                <p>I was lucky enough to get the call. George Vest called me and said that they had
                    decided that they wanted to go with a career officer and a recess appointment.
                    That meant that I would have to be in Portugal by January 21 or 22. In other
                    words, before Congress returned from the Christmas recess. This meant a very
                    quick turnaround.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: Let me talk about the threads. Wes Egan was the Charg� d'Affaires in
                    Lisbon at the time. Major Portuguese figures knew me fairly well. As soon as I
                    called George Vest back and said that I would accept nomination as Ambassador to
                    Portugal, the Department got the papers over to the White House within 24 hours
                    — even while I was filling in the formal documents. They used the documents
                    which I had filled in in 1987 before going to Bolivia. The White House said,
                    “Yes,” and within three days the Department had asked Wes Egan to get agr�ment
                    for me. Wes obtained agr�ment almost instantly by Portuguese standards. There
                    may have been a delay of perhaps a week, but it went amazingly fast there. But
                    then, you know, I knew the President of Portugal personally. I knew the Prime
                    Minister. I knew the Foreign Minister. I knew the chief figures in the
                    Opposition as well as in the government parties. So they knew what they were
                    saying “yes” to. They didn't have to ask somebody, “Who is this person?”</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Portugal, the credentials ceremony was already planned to take
                    place within four or five days so I could become fully functional immediately.
                    This was good, because Frank Carlucci, the Secretary of Defense, was due to
                    arrive in Lisbon within 10 days on an official visit. I needed to be able to
                    operate. The day after I arrived in Lisbon I went to a barber shop near the
                    Embassy Chancery building, the barber shop which I knew Mario Soares, President
                    of Portugal used to frequent when he was not in office. I went into the barber
                    shop and found a chair. Sitting next to me and having his hair cut was Mario
                    Soares. So we had a good and very friendly chat within 24 hours of my arrival,
                    even before I presented my credentials. We talked a little about the general
                    relationship between Portugal and the United States. I said how good it was to
                    be back in Portugal and see old friends.</p>
                <p>I walked in, unannounced, at the Goulbenkian Foundation for one of its regular
                    concerts a day later and bumped into a dozen friends — people in industry, in
                    government, in the foundation, in business. I had an impromptu reunion with
                    them.</p>
                <p>My wife hadn't yet arrived with me, because she was packing up our household
                    effects in La Paz, Bolivia and getting us out of there. When we flew back to
                    Bolivia immediately after Christmas and New Year's — I'd spent the intervening
                    days filling in papers in Washington related to my appointment to Portugal — I
                    had 10 days left. I got back to Washington, spent two and one-half days in
                    Washington, and was sworn in as Ambassador to Portugal by George Vest, Director
                    General of the Foreign Service. He told me that it was a great pleasure to swear
                    me in as Ambassador because normally all he did was to swear people out of the
                    Foreign Service. This was one of the few occasions when he, as Director General,
                    got to bring somebody into a new job. Then I left for Portugal.</p>
                <p>You were asking...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My other question was, what was the state of Portugal when
                        you arrived there in January, 1988? Could you contrast it with when you were
                        there before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Thank you, Professor, I always like questions like that. Regarding things
                    that had changed. First of all, there had been a real estate boom after Portugal
                    entered the European Union. Money began to flow in from the nasty winter weather
                    capitals of the European Union — from Frankfurt, Bonn, and even London and other
                    places. This happened as people who were doing very well decided to buy vacation
                    homes in Portugal. Also, a lot of business firms from other parts of Europe were
                    coming into Portugal. Those people were buying up space for offices. There
                    seemed to be jobs for almost everyone.</p>
                <p>Almost everyone had bought an automobile, so Lisbon, a city which had been a
                    little hair-raising when it came to automobile traffic previously, had become
                    much worse. There was no parking available. Cars were parked in the streets and
                    on the sidewalks. Cars raced around. It was nearly total chaos, really bad. We
                    had a communicator at the Embassy who insisted on riding a motorcycle on one of
                    the most notorious roads between the Embassy Chancery area and one of the
                    residential areas. Somebody probably tipped his motorcycle. He didn't know
                    exactly what happened. He wound up hospitalized and suffering from broken bones
                    for several months. It was very dangerous on the road.</p>
                <p>Air pollution was horrible, and restaurant prices were up, but there was a kind
                    of vibrancy, a confidence in the air. The Portuguese also knew that they were
                    well past the immediate post revolutionary phase.</p>
                <p>The aristocracy and the top financial leaders who had left Portugal immediately
                    after the revolution of 1974 had all returned and were reasserting their
                    financial authority. They were much more engaged in politics and were resuming
                    the old status that they had enjoyed before the revolution.</p>
                <p>A lot of roads were being built, as well as power lines, communications lines,
                    and schools. These were partially financed by the European Union under its
                    Structural Support Fund Program, which provides money to bring the least
                    developed parts of the Union's member countries up to the average economic level
                    of the European Union as a whole. This work was well advanced in Portugal. I
                    subsequently learned during my later stay as Ambassador in Luxembourg that the
                    authorities at the European Investment Bank and in the European Union in
                    Brussels thought that Portugal and Spain had done particularly well in managing
                    the funds under the Structural Support Fund program. The European Union had
                    provided money for infrastructure — a bridge, communications link, or a school
                    or hospital. They would come down three years later, and could see that they had
                    gotten exactly what they expected. They were pleased with the results.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>There were some things in Portugal that had not changed. One of them was the
                    belief among people in the Azores that somehow or other the US would always pay
                    substantial amounts of money to retain base rights at Lajes air force base. The
                    Portuguese defense establishment tended to rely on US military assistance to
                    make up Portuguese shortfalls in budgeting for defense purposes. Remember that
                    all of the military assistance was aimed at bringing Portuguese forces up to
                    full NATO qualifications to perform the missions assigned. They were to
                    participate in a Rapid Reaction Force. They also were responsible for maritime
                    patrol and protection of the sea lanes in a major quadrant of the Atlantic Ocean
                    that reached out to the Azores. So their expectations in terms of US military
                    assistance remained very high.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we were starting into a phase when US military budgets would
                    be shrinking. I had to renegotiate the base agreement in the Azores that had
                    already lapsed before I arrived. I did so. It took a year. It was one of those
                    things that went back and forth. The bottom line was that we had much less to
                    offer than we had been able to offer in previous years. We had to walk back from
                    some commitments that we had made in previous years. They were being stretched
                    out by the appropriations process itself. That made the process quite difficult
                    and even painful.</p>
                <p>I was in a situation in which I was de facto the principal negotiator on the base
                    arrangement in the Azores. I had taken part in base negotiations with Portugal
                    and Spain previously when I had been Director of Western European Affairs in the
                    State Department. At that time the principal negotiator had been an Assistant
                    Secretary of State in Washington who traveled over for negotiating sessions.
                    This time I handled the negotiations as the Chief of Mission on the site.</p>
                <p>When I left Lisbon, I recommended to the Department of State — I think much to
                    the chagrin of my successor — that the principal negotiator should NOT be the
                    resident Ambassador. The resident Ambassador needs to be a person who becomes a
                    kind of lightning rod and court of appeal. He should be a person observing the
                    process and perceiving where there is confusion and where there are real,
                    confrontational problems. However, when you make the resident Ambassador the
                    negotiator, then, if there is a real confrontation or difficulty, there is no
                    one to appeal to except the chief of state. Well, you don't appeal to Presidents
                    or Prime Ministers to resolve disagreements on social security payments for the
                    local labor force at Lajes air force base in the Azores.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Anyhow, the Portuguese designated the Secretary General of the Foreign Ministry
                    as their negotiator, and I was the negotiator for our side. As I said, the
                    negotiations took a year to complete. I frankly engaged in a lot of tactical
                    planning, since the core issue was to be the level of defense assistance that we
                    could provide. That meant that the US Defense Department was the principal
                    contributing party. The Defense Department played a significant role both in
                    preparing our positions and in helping to conduct the negotiations.
                    Periodically, a Defense Department representative would come to Lisbon, and we
                    would have formal negotiating rounds with the Portuguese. In between the formal
                    rounds I had a lot of informal discussions with the Secretary General of the
                    Foreign Ministry. He, in turn, was pulling together interested parties from the
                    Portuguese Defense Ministry, Finance Ministry, Regional Government of the Azores
                    — trying to work out something that would be acceptable. We exchanged thoughts
                    fairly frequently. At the end it came down to something between three and six
                    maritime helicopters and how many F-16 aircraft we would provide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The F-16 at that time was our top of the line fighter
                        aircraft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was our work horse fighter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was no longer really a top of the line fighter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: But it was our principal, work horse fighter in NATO. I told the US
                    Defense Department how many F-16's and maritime helicopters I thought we needed
                    to offer. They came back with a package. Then I went in and made an offer.
                    Frankly, I didn't offer what I was authorized to offer. I offered less, because
                    that's the way the Portuguese negotiate. If I had offered the whole package,
                    that would have become the floor from which they would have gone further. The
                    negotiations became very tight and went back and forth for several weeks. Since
                    I already had the authority, I went back to the Portuguese and increased the
                    offer but didn't go as far as I was authorized. Again, that offer didn't do very
                    well. I told the Portuguese that I had exhausted my negotiating authority.</p>
                <p>I knew that I was very close to the ceiling and I knew how tight our budget and
                    other authorizations were. I had a sense of the cost-cutting mood of the
                    Congress. I felt that since I had been the negotiator, what this required at
                    that point was somebody who would arrive on the scene like a deus ex machina and
                    say, “This is our last offer. This is the end of it.” So I told the US Defense
                    Department that I had not gone to the maximum which the Defense and State
                    Departments and the White House had authorized. I pointed out that we would be
                    having our semi-annual NATO meeting involving Defense Ministers within a month
                    at The Hague in the Netherlands. I said that I thought that that was the right
                    place and that Secretary of Defense Carlucci was the right person to conclude
                    the matter directly with the Portuguese Defense Minister, with others sitting in
                    the room. I thought that that would wrap up the negotiation.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>I went to The Hague for that meeting and gave Carlucci whatever advice that I
                    could on what was happening. Carlucci obviously knew all of the Portuguese from
                    his time there as Ambassador immediately following the revolution of 1974. He
                    didn't need to be given any of the background. He made an offer which went a
                    little bit beyond what I had been authorized to offer. This didn't surprise me.
                    I figured that the US Defense Department had probably been holding something
                    back. And the negotiation was concluded.</p>
                <p>The point I'm trying to make is that in conducting that kind of negotiation,
                    there always has to be some kind of appeal mechanism in reserve — some kind of
                    person who can come in, as a kind of deus ex machina, and say, “This is it” to
                    top level people on the other side. Because they are top level figures and the
                    final offer is a little bit better for one side and not too insufferable for the
                    other side, they can say, “That's it. That's the deal.” All of the subordinates
                    have to accept it, and you're home free. Basically, this was the strategic line
                    that I had adopted in conducting the negotiation after we'd been in it for about
                    six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard that in other base negotiations sometimes the
                        most difficult position for the Ambassador to be in is negotiating with the
                        US Department of Defense. Often this is on base rights and so forth.
                        However, I assume that in the case of the Azores the base rights had been
                        exercised for so long that they were no longer a particular issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The critical issue was the level of US military assistance to Portugal.
                    There were some problems in the Azores. We'd been held up in getting permission
                    to put up some relatively new and easier-to-maintain facilities for the
                    Americans stationed at Lajes air force base. We had a problem over the social
                    security payments for Portuguese personnel at the base in the local labor force.
                    The Azorean government was trying to claim substantial amounts of back payments.
                    Another issue was over a different local tax, but I don't remember what it
                    was.</p>
                <p>These issues were part of the environment in the negotiation, but they weren't
                    resolved in the negotiation. They were handled separately. In fact, I got them
                    all resolved. I had a very close relationship with the Portuguese Minister of
                    the Republic for the Azores, General Rocha Vieira, who later became the
                    Portuguese Governor of Macao. He is still there. He undertook to deal with the
                    Azorean authorities in a way that was suitably responsible from the Portuguese
                    perspective. As a general, he knew the Portuguese defense establishment. As a
                    cabinet minister he had the confidence of the President of Portugal and of the
                    government. He went ahead and handled the matter in the Azores. We were able to
                    find a workable solution on every one of these little ancillary issues that tend
                    to drive a base commander up the wall and always give the Pentagon a certain
                    amount of grief. So, in all of this the American Embassy in Lisbon did its
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the problem, which continues, that the Azores
                        are technically part of the NATO context, but we have interests there beyond
                        NATO. I think in particular of the Middle East and Libya. You might explain
                        the context involved. Were these subjects addressed in the
                        negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Since World War II the Azores facilities have had two functions. One was
                    to provide a platform for anti-submarine patrols and protection of the North
                    Atlantic sealanes. The other function was to serve as a refueling stop for
                    airlifts to other parts of the world — to Africa, the Middle East, South Asia
                    and Europe. For example, the Azores were terribly important during the buildup
                    before the Gulf War in 1990-1991. We used the Azores repeatedly for certain
                    flights — very often involving disaster relief — going into Africa. We always
                    used the Azores with the consent of the Portuguese. Under the terms of the
                    agreement a mechanism was provided for clearing flights through the Azores.</p>
                <p>When we were ferrying small aircraft such as F-16's to Europe — for example, Air
                    National Guard units going to Europe on a temporary basis — they would often
                    transit the Azores. There might be a squadron or two squadrons of F-16's, F-4's,
                    or whatever the aircraft involved. They could reach the Azores on one load of
                    fuel, refuel, and then get over to Europe. So a lot of air traffic went through
                    the Azores. The US component at Lajes air force base was operated by the US Air
                    Force. That is, the operations contingent at the base was run by the US Air
                    Force. It had a US Navy group attached to it for anti-submarine warfare. And a
                    US Army group ran the tugboats in the harbor. So the US Air Force ran the ground
                    installation, the US Navy most often was flying the airplanes in and out on
                    anti-submarine patrols, and the US Army was in charge of the tugboats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the issue come up of, say, supporting the
                        responsibilities, as we saw them, of resupply to Israel in case of an Arab
                        attack?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Obviously, it came up in 1973 during the Arab-Israel War of that year.
                    The Portuguese, as I mentioned earlier in this interview, had felt that their
                    compliance with the terms of our agreement, which allowed us to use the Azores,
                    had cost Portugal dearly in terms of its relationships with the Muslim
                    countries. As the Portuguese saw it, this seriously affected the reliability of
                    their energy supply which came primarily from the Persian Gulf at that time in
                    terms of oil. I don't recall, during my time in Portugal as DCM, that there was
                    any Israeli emergency that required the use of the Azores or during my time
                    there as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything in the negotiations implicitly saying
                        that if the US attempted to resupply Israel through the Azores, the
                        Portuguese Government didn't want us to do this? Did this come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>ROWELL: No. There was some discussion about the mechanism for clearing flights
                    through the Azores. The bottom line, and it was a kind of common sense bottom
                    line, was, “Look, the routine, normal use that goes on all the time, including
                    the weekly supply flight to Embassies in Africa and the periodic flights of Air
                    National Guard units to NATO bases wherever they were, in Sicily, Italy, Spain,
                    or wherever” presented no problems. The Portuguese wanted to treat these flights
                    almost as an air traffic matter. They left this to the Portuguese commander at
                    the air base, who was the overall commander of the facility. The Brigadier
                    General commanding our forces had to salute the Portuguese commander.</p>
                <p>If there was a potential controversy or political problem involved in the
                    activity, they wanted to be consulted, and preferably earlier, rather than
                    later. They didn't want any of these cases where we would get a telegram or a
                    telephone call one night, saying that there's going to be a transit tomorrow at
                    10:00 AM, local time, and it's going to some place where it could cause the
                    Portuguese a problem. During my time as Ambassador there were probably three or
                    four occasions where we did that kind of thing. I didn't have any control over
                    the timing of the requests.</p>
                <p>So the negotiation on transit rights through the Azores really involved how to
                    define this broad category of potentially controversial events so that it
                    covered everything, but without being too specific. The Portuguese didn't want
                    to be specific. You wouldn't know in advance with whom a problem might come up,
                    two years later. So there had to be a kind of generic definition. Secondly,
                    there would need to be some base lines for advance notification so that the
                    Portuguese could consider, with some degree of care, the implications. We
                    managed to negotiate that without any difficulty.</p>
                <p>There is a difference between political and legal style between the US and
                    Portugal. For the Portuguese the intent of an agreement and common sense
                    interpretation is what you rely on. If you rely on that, then you can presume
                    that you have the political will on both sides to make an agreement work. If the
                    political will is there, the agreement will work. If you attempt to provide for
                    every contingency through some clause in a contract, because you rely on the
                    contracts as you write them, you're not guaranteeing yourself anything in
                    dealing with Portugal. That's not the way they work.</p>
                <p>The fundamental issue is political will. We're dealing with sovereign powers.
                    There is no court to which one can appeal if the agreement doesn't work or one
                    of the parties doesn't comply with the agreement for some reason. In subsequent
                    years, after my departure from Portugal, the US didn't fulfill its commitments
                    on aid, but we still use the Lajes facility.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>The tendency of our lawyers is to try to nail down every last detail. Sometimes,
                    this effort goes too far. Our lawyers are right to want to nail down a whole
                    bunch of details, particularly in terms of the status of forces, customs
                    exemptions, and all of those kinds of things, where you'll have administrators
                    on both sides doing things. If it's all written down, they have no problem and
                    they just do it. If it's not all written down, then it can become political and
                    sticky. However, on the major issues we shouldn't assume that writing it all
                    down solves it, because it doesn't.</p>
                <p>I spent much of my two years as Ambassador to Portugal visiting the Azores,
                    talking directly with the Azorean authorities, from the President of the Azorean
                    Regional Government to the legislators and others, warning them over and over
                    again that the Cold War style of military assistance was finished. The agreement
                    that I was finally able to sign in January, 1989, was probably the last of any
                    generosity that they would ever see. However, they had to start making
                    provisions for the future, both in their budget and in their plans for the
                    development of the Azores which would be based on other ways to earn income,
                    because Lajes Air Force Base wasn't going to pay for it.</p>
                <p>I'd started the spade work, and some people had begun to believe it. The
                    Communists were beginning to use those statements to beat up on the regional
                    government for not being prudent in budgeting to take this changed situation
                    into account. I have to admit that it was my immediate successor as Ambassador
                    and his successor who finally brought this issue home to the present situation
                    in which, in effect, we're giving the Portuguese nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with the American troops on the
                        Azores in their relations with the Azoreans? We've just gone through a case
                        of rape and other problems on Okinawa, but it's a wholly different type of
                        military presence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Nothing of any notoriety occurred while I was in Lisbon. Obviously, that
                    had nothing to do with me but rather with the quality of military leadership and
                    discipline which the American military were showing in the Azores themselves.
                    There were occasionally incidents, but they were normally handled in the islands
                    and discreetly, under the terms of the Status of Forces agreement. Incidents
                    could cut both ways. Occasionally an American serviceperson would suffer a raw
                    deal at the hands of an unscrupulous landlord. Such problems were relatively
                    rare on both sides. I never had to become involved in anything like that. So I
                    never had a problem the way our Ambassador in Tokyo has had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the staff at the Embassy at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>ROWELL: The Embassy staff was well qualified. I had a superb Deputy Chief of
                    Mission, Wes Egan, who is now our Ambassador to Jordan. I had known him when he
                    was the second-ranking officer in the Political Section in Lisbon from 1970 to
                    1980 or 1981. The Political Counselor was very, very strong and one of those
                    unfortunate people who was being forced out of the Foreign Service because of
                    too long a period of time in grade. That is, he had not been promoted for a long
                    time. We always had someone in Lisbon with African experience assigned from the
                    Bureau of African Affairs because of Portugal's continuing interests in Africa
                    and our desire to coordinate whatever we were doing with the Portuguese,
                    particularly as it related to Soviet involvement in Angola and Mozambique. This
                    was still the period of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>The Economic Counselors were good. We had an aggressive Agricultural Counselor,
                    which was important because we were trying to recover agricultural business
                    which we had lost due to Portugal's entry into the European Union. The
                    Commercial Counselor was a strong figure. USIS [United States Information
                    Service] was always strong, and their FSN's [Foreign Service Nationals] always
                    played a critical role. I had outstanding access to Portuguese television and
                    press. I did TV and press interviews, all in Portuguese. USIS knew how to make
                    my language skills pay to the maximum.</p>
                <p>We haven't talked about the junior officers. I was encountering an entirely new
                    group of junior officers. This was, after all, 10 years after I had first
                    arrived in Portugal. In terms of basic preparation the junior officers were
                    very, very strong. Some had advanced degrees. They almost certainly had some
                    post-graduate college work. There was some unevenness in performance. Some of
                    them really weren't cut out for the Foreign Service. I remember one couple where
                    the wife wasn't cut out for the Foreign Service. Her husband had to choose
                    between being a Foreign Service Officer and being married. He chose the latter
                    and resigned. This was clearly a growing problem because, since officers were
                    entering the Foreign Service at a later age, there was a somewhat greater
                    likelihood that they would be married and that the spouse was someone who had
                    married an aspiring lawyer, an aspiring MBA [Master's degree in Business
                    Administration] candidate, or an aspiring historian. She didn't realize that she
                    was perhaps marrying the Foreign Service. This was new and different. Some of
                    them took to it, but many of them didn't. The later the age of entry into the
                    Foreign Service, the greater our recruitment and retention risks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it purely because of the marriage or was it also
                        because of the type of person who enters the Foreign Service? From your
                        observation there, did you see any officers who didn't have a problem with
                        their spouses but they just weren't cut out for the Foreign Service? How did
                        this show?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, when somebody isn't cut out for the Foreign Service, typically you
                    see a person who finds it very hard to get out of the office, establish
                    relationships with host country nationals, or wine them and dine them and come
                    back and produce something that has valuable information for us. Or you have
                    somebody whose household is dysfunctional. Things don't go well at home, and the
                    person arrives at the office tired or maybe late. And there is an unending
                    string of complaints and illnesses. Occasionally, I've seen people who would
                    come in, but if they were in a reporting function, such as Political or Economic
                    work, they would simply be unable to produce quality reports. That is, something
                    that reflects an understanding of what is relevant to American interests and can
                    state it concisely and in a useful, analytical structure for Washington. In
                    their reports they wander all over and produce a kind of stream of consciousness
                    reporting or something that was just based on a Memorandum of Conversation and
                    is limited to that. It had no particular relevance. Maybe memoranda of
                    conversation are significant if you've just been talking to the Prime Minister,
                    the Foreign Minister or the President. But they probably have only internal
                    research value when they record a talk with a senior person in one of the local
                    political parties.</p>
                <p>The officers were all good. There were the usual frustrations. Junior officers
                    generally don't enjoy visa lines. They would like more independent authority
                    than they usually get. If you have a Political Counselor who hasn't had any
                    training in management and how to structure political work, junior officers can
                    get frustrated. That happened at one stage — and did not involve the first
                    Political Counselor whom I referred to.</p>
                <p>However, on the whole I would say that it was a good Embassy. It was strong. We
                    had an AID person who was cleaning up the residual matters in Portugal and
                    working part time for AID in North Africa. He was a housing specialist, but he
                    was very imaginative and knew how to close down the program and how to shift
                    things over to Portuguese institutions, so that all the good that we had managed
                    to accomplish since the revolution would be preserved. He was also very good at
                    working closely both with the Commercial Attach�, when there were business
                    opportunities coming up, and with USIS at making sure that we got appropriate
                    kinds of credit for our efforts. He did this in a way that wasn't overbearing or
                    demeaning or somehow implying that we were kind of running things, as we used to
                    do too often in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about both the role of the Agricultural
                        Counselor and the whole agricultural problem? This was one of the major
                        items on your agenda when you arrived in Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Right. When Portugal and Spain entered what is today the European Union,
                    the United States negotiated compensation arrangements with the Union, because
                    we knew that under the rules of Portuguese and Spanish entry we would lose a
                    substantial share of our market for agricultural commodities. Most of these
                    commodities were used for animal feed — for fodder. This included soya cake for
                    animal fodder. However, there were some shipments of grains and oils for human
                    consumption as well. There were some types of agricultural goods, for example,
                    corn gluten, where the rules of the European Union didn't particularly inhibit
                    the import. Our Agricultural Attach� was out trying to develop Portuguese
                    interest in these other types of commodities.</p>
                <p>There was a transition period provided for in the agreement with the European
                    Union, during which Portugal and Spain gradually switched over to the
                    Community-wide external tariff. During this transition period our market in
                    Portugal and Spain for agricultural commodities declined but wasn't totally
                    closed off. So the Agricultural Attach� did what Agricultural Attach�s do.</p>
                <p>The other things that the Agricultural Attach� had to do was to talk with the
                    Portuguese authorities about the positions that Portugal would adopt in meetings
                    of the Agricultural Council of the European Community. That Council managed the
                    Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] of the European Union. To the extent that we
                    could persuade the Portuguese that they ought to adopt positions that would make
                    it easier for American commodities to come into the European Community, that
                    would help us. At least there would be one vote in the Community in terms of
                    that kind of trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How responsive did you find the Portuguese on matters
                        dealing with the European Community—representing not just our interest but
                        mutual interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Well first of all, the Portuguese look after their own interests. We're
                    responsible for our interests, and they're responsible for theirs. They would
                    receive our representations, but every member of the European Community has a
                    complicated calculus. Although they may be hurt by one set of Community rules,
                    the Community tends to compensate them in some other arena. So if the Portuguese
                    have to pay more for animal feed, and this is hurting their agriculture, then
                    the Community might find a way to increase the subsidy funds coming to Portugal,
                    either to help Portuguese agriculture, Portuguese agricultural education, or
                    transport that would reduce some aspect of agricultural costs.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>Since a basic policy of the European Community was to provide subsidies to
                    upgrade the less developed economies of the Community, Portugal was getting a
                    lot of that money. In the end, I think that the Portuguese — although I have no
                    written document that would prove this — would make their own judgment about
                    where Portugal's interests lay. They would say, “All right, if we can get this
                    much more from the European Community, that will more than offset what we might
                    be losing by having to pay more for American agricultural commodities and
                    foodstuffs.” Then they would conduct their negotiations at Brussels on that
                    basis and generally came out well from a Portuguese point of view. From our
                    point of view, we kept them aware of what the costs were, and that helped them
                    calculate more closely what they could get from the European Community — but
                    they always got it. We didn't get any important help from the Portuguese on
                    European Community Common Agricultural Policy questions.</p>
                <p>Our biggest sales triumph was in coal for new power plants that were going up.
                    There was also a kind of investment triumph in helping American companies to
                    negotiate attractive terms for establishing factories in Portugal. Of course,
                    Portugal was anxious to get that investment and negotiated in a very serious
                    way. The Embassy's role was primarily one of keeping an ear to the ground,
                    understanding the American firms' major concerns and interests, as well as
                    something about the competitive offers that firms from other countries were
                    making. Then we tried to understand what the Portuguese were thinking. There was
                    one investment project involving Ford Motor Company, for example, which set up
                    an automotive electronics factory. They kept me rather fully informed of their
                    interest from the beginning and the progress of their negotiations. There were
                    several occasions when I was able to telephone a point man, a former Foreign
                    Service Officer, Bill Kelly, and say, “Look, this is beginning to happen. The
                    Portuguese are beginning to think this way. I don't think that that squares with
                    what you told me the last time you and I discussed this matter.” He said, “No,
                    it doesn't, and thank you very much.” I was able to give American companies some
                    heads up advance notice like that.</p>
                <p>Ford had their own manager there, who was very good. However, there were times
                    when we would hear things that he didn't hear, even though he was a native
                    Portuguese and well connected — the right kind of family and all that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>My point in saying this is that even the biggest American corporations gain if
                    they can work comfortably with an Embassy. I know of many American corporations
                    who have misgivings about keeping in touch with an Embassy, because they believe
                    that Embassies misuse corporate proprietary information and sometimes leak it to
                    people to whom it shouldn't be leaked. Either to the government with which
                    they're negotiating or to their competitors. I've always treated corporation
                    confidential material as carefully as I treated US security classified material.
                    I think that Bill Kelly was able to persuade his superiors at Ford headquarters
                    that we had a very effective and helpful relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>I was able to help a couple of other American companies — Texas Instruments at
                    one point, Digital Computer Corporation at another point — sometimes by helping
                    them to cross talk with other American corporate managements within Portugal.
                    Remember that these factories were not all in one industrial park, so that the
                    management of a factory South of Lisbon normally wouldn't be talking to the
                    management of a factory near Oporto. However, I had a series of business
                    meetings that took place regularly which allowed them to cross talk. Issues
                    would arise.For example, Portuguese entry into the European Community meant that
                    Portuguese citizens were free to go to work in other countries under the new
                    European Single Act. Although this didn't mean much to hod carriers and grape
                    pickers, it meant a great deal to certified public accountants, production
                    engineers, and certain other professionals. Suddenly, companies in Portugal —
                    Portuguese as well as American — were discovering that if they didn't double or
                    triple the compensation they were paying to a senior professional, that person
                    might go to Madrid. The cost of living in Madrid was higher than it was in
                    Portugal, but the professional couldn't resist the much higher income. Or the
                    Portuguese professional might get an offer in Bordeaux or Lyon, France. So the
                    costs of companies established in Portugal were rising sharply in a way that
                    they hadn't anticipated. This problem was another issue that we took up with
                    American companies in Portugal.</p>
                <p>There were no major aircraft sales at that time, although I had been instrumental
                    in helping Lockheed to sell Tri-Star jet transport plane aircraft to the
                    Portuguese airline at an earlier stage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political situation in Portugal when you
                        were Ambassador? What were our concerns? This was a transitional period.
                        During this period we saw the Soviet Union cease to exist, or we were
                        getting close to that point. Portugal was working out the kinks of its
                        revolution. What were our interests? How did we deal with the various
                        political parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Glasnost [openness in Russian] and Perestroika [restructuring in Russian]
                    had arrived. From my point of view the most significant implication was that
                    there were openings to try to solve the civil and guerrilla wars going on in
                    Angola and Mozambique. We had a series of negotiations with the Soviets. The
                    negotiators sometimes met in Italy because Italy was a major factor in trying to
                    broker peace in Mozambique. Some of the meetings between the US and the Soviets
                    were held in the American Embassy residence in Lisbon. For that purpose it was
                    the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister for African Affairs, whose name doesn't
                    immediately come to my mind right now. The US negotiators were Frank Wisner and
                    the non-career Assistant Secretary of State, Chet Crocker, a well reputed
                    academician. They both came. Sometimes the sessions would last for three hours
                    at a time in that residence. Once or twice these sessions were held at the
                    Russian Embassy, but most of the time they were held at our Embassy residence. I
                    was present a couple of times but did not participate in them, for the most
                    part. The negotiations were not between me and anybody in particular. I was
                    providing facilitative assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>The Portuguese were delighted to have these negotiations taking place in Lisbon
                    in view of their deep involvements and major economic interests in both former
                    colonies. One of the interests the Portuguese had was the $400 million World
                    Bank loan they had taken out just before the revolution of 1974 to build the
                    Cabora Bassa Dam in Mozambique. The dam had been built, but Mozambique wasn't
                    able to make payments on the loan because guerrilla activities kept interrupting
                    the flow of electric power to South Africa, which was the principal customer. At
                    the time South Africa was still a pariah country. This meant that, since the
                    Portuguese Government had guaranteed the loan, Lisbon was stuck with making the
                    payments. They were anxious to get out from under that.</p>
                <p>I said earlier that in terms of internal politics, Portugal was well past the
                    immediate, post-revolutionary phase. The Portuguese Governments were lasting for
                    a full term of office. They had clear programs which basically were private
                    sector oriented toward integrating the country into the European Union and
                    making the most of Portugal's membership in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as if you could call this a very comfortable
                        relationship with Portugal when you were there the second time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. However, there was one aspect of my strategy for dealing with the
                    country, the defense relationship, which had been at the heart of our
                    associations with Portugal since World War II. This was now declining to third,
                    fourth, or fifth place in terms of daily business. The use of Lajes air force
                    base in the Azores might or might not go down, but the relationship involving
                    large transfers of US military assistance certainly was finished.</p>
                <p>I needed to find something else to sustain a relationship that, on the whole, had
                    been very positive. It had been good for us and good for Portugal. It was the
                    kind of thing that we needed to sustain. I looked to cultural and educational
                    relations to help to sustain that relationship. Obviously, to the extent that we
                    had American firms that felt that they saw an opportunity for investment in
                    Portugal, that was one major component of a good relationship. American firms
                    know their own business. I wasn't telling them to invest in Portugal because it
                    was good for the US. What I did tell them was that if it was going to be good
                    for them to invest in Portugal, I hoped they would do so. I knew that the
                    Portuguese would treat them well and would stick to their agreements. That kind
                    of association was what we had to have to sustain an easy, workable relationship
                    for the long term future.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>On much the same grounds I tried to use my role as a member of the Board of
                    Directors of the Luso-American Development Foundation to get the foundation to
                    increase resources allocated to Portuguese universities to help them enhance
                    their relationships with American universities. The objective was to ensure that
                    there were more exchanges among faculty members and somewhat more exchanges
                    among students — exchanges involving research projects that would be of interest
                    on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Although the foundation would provide seed
                    money, in the end we all recognized that these relationships would have to
                    become self-sustaining and that intellectual and personal ties would have to
                    take form. In future years this would lead to the creation of additional
                    research projects that might help Ph.D. candidates to obtain funding from the
                    kinds of resources normally available to universities. Such funding could come
                    from foundations, government research grants, or something like that, and would
                    not be dependent on the Luso-American Development Foundation. It definitely
                    would have nothing to do with our old defense relationship.</p>
                <p>The initiative on education worked reasonably well. I know that the Luso-American
                    Development Foundation still supports those kinds of relationships. In fact, the
                    Foundation occasionally sponsors lectures and meetings in Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Portugal, the Foundation was in danger of spending itself out
                    of business. We reversed that. Basically, this was done by reversing the size of
                    the American input. Before my arrival there had been a tendency to treat the
                    Foundation almost as an AID type operation. AID's philosophy, when it implements
                    a project, is to get the project started and then get out. There were some
                    people in AID who felt that, “Well, we provided all of the capital for this,”
                    and indeed we had. One of the areas where we short-changed the Portuguese on the
                    agreement that had been signed before I arrived was in the capital going to this
                    Foundation. We weren't paying into it, although we had committed ourselves to do
                    that. Of the funds we provided, some were used to subsidize the Azorean
                    Government and some went to the Foundation. Our appropriations shortfall was so
                    large that the Portuguese Government had to take out of its own Treasury funds
                    to make up for our shortfall in terms of subsidies to the Azorean Government. So
                    there was nothing left for the Foundation.</p>
                <p>However, the Foundation's Portuguese directors managed to get additional
                    contributions from the Portuguese Government. We changed the basic approach to
                    projects. There were more co-sponsorships. There was a smaller share, in terms
                    of seed capital for various projects, and there was more emphasis on technical
                    assistance. I am happy to say that the Foundation continues to function. I think
                    that it is a very good institution. The objective was to bring its expenses to a
                    level that the interest on the endowment could support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of foundations, you mentioned the Gulbenkian
                        Foundation. I think of Gulbenkian as being a wealthy, Armenian arms dealer
                        or someone of World War I vintage. Or was it oil that was the source of his
                        wealth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>ROWELL: It was oil. He traded in oil and he got five percent on every deal. That
                    was his margin. He had enjoyed living in Portugal from time to time, though his
                    preferred residence was London. When he was close to dying, he asked his lawyer,
                    who happened to be a Portuguese, a man named Azeredo Perdig�o, to propose to the
                    British that his beautiful but small art collection might be given to one of the
                    British museums in London — I don't know which one. This impressive collection
                    included antiques going back to 2,000 years before Christ, some of them Chinese
                    artifacts. Gulbenkian said that he would provide the money to build an
                    appropriate wing to house his collection. He would then provide an endowment to
                    ensure its permanent care and so on.</p>
                <p>The British said, “No.” They said that they ran their own museums. They would be
                    glad to have Gulbenkian's collection but they would manage it in their own way.
                    That didn't satisfy Gulbenkian. He asked, “Where should it go?” Perdig�o said,
                    “Why don't you put it in Portugal? Portugal's always been good to you, and I'm
                    sure that the Portuguese Government would accommodate your desires.” They did.
                    Gulbenkian set up the endowment and built the museum in Portugal. In 1988 the
                    endowment was worth between $1.2 and $1.5 billion. It included some assets that
                    were not producing much income but were appreciating in value. The Gulbenkian
                    Foundation was spending about $60 million a year on its various activities. So,
                    in addition to the original museum, it supported a performing arts program, a
                    resident orchestra and ballet company, visiting companies and performances, and
                    all kinds of good things. The Gulbenkian Foundation also funded some chairs of
                    Portuguese language at universities in the United States. It contributed to the
                    restoration of Portuguese installations in Asia which had been constructed
                    during the age of discoveries, including cathedrals and churches — that kind of
                    thing. It is a big deal in Portugal. It is, perhaps, the Portuguese equivalent
                    of the Ford Foundation.</p>

                    there was a murder at a meeting of the Socialist International in the Algarve

                    terrorist act. At this point I simply don't remember who was killed, but it
                    clearly involved a PLO-type assassination. I am reluctant to say the PLO,

                    the Middle East. That incident shocked the Portuguese. They suddenly realized
                    that there is no permanently neutral ground. You cannot always expect that
                    people will respect your territory because they need it as a place to base
                    themselves or get together. The Portuguese instituted more serious customs
                    inspection programs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Portuguese-Americans play any part in matters you were
                        concerned with? There are quite a few Portuguese in the United States,
                        particularly on the East Coast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: At the time the most prominent Portuguese-American was Tony Coelho, a
                    Democratic Congressman from the San Joaquin Valley in California. He was quite
                    high in the Democratic Party hierarchy in the House of Representatives. He
                    visited Portugal a couple of times during my tenure there as Ambassador and was
                    received very well. I think that he was the Democratic Whip in the House of
                    Representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that you're right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I would say that he was encouraged to come to Portugal. The Portuguese
                    understand the way the American Congress works well enough to know that having a
                    Portuguese-American in such a senior, influential position in the House of
                    Representatives was a good thing in any case and potentially quite useful.
                    However, I don't recall any specific instance in which this made a critical
                    difference.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: No. We didn't have that kind of problem. Coelho didn't represent enough
                    influence to make a complete exception for Portugal as we were cutting back on
                    our appropriations for defense cooperation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 8, 1996, and is a continuation of the
                        interview with Ambassador Ed Rowell. Ed, can you talk about Mario Soares
                        during your second tour in Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. You are asking about my impression of Mario Soares during the period
                    from 1988-90 and whether the man had changed. My answer is that the man was
                    remarkably consistent. He had mellowed quite a bit in the first years after the
                    revolution, when he realized that socialist ideology was inadequate for
                    governing a country or even for dealing with many of the problems of government
                    in the economic field.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier in this interview, he had at least twice pushed a
                    Socialist-led coalition government to take serious monetary measures to stop
                    inflation and get the country back on a healthy economic track. Each time the
                    coalition government paid the political price by being voted out of office.</p>
                <p>Now he was President of Portugal. He was seeing the issues of government from a
                    very different perspective. He had been one of the main contributors to the
                    post-revolutionary, Portuguese constitution. He had insisted on a structure
                    which paralleled that of the French Fifth Republic — what they called a
                    semi-presidential structure. Under this system you have a President with some
                    authority. You also have a parliamentary, ministerial style of government with
                    some authority. And the dividing line isn't always clear. When you have strong
                    personalities from opposite political parties in each office, that of the
                    President and of the Prime Minister, with different philosophies, you have
                    friction.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>There had been friction in Portuguese governments from the first day of the
                    ratification of their new constitution. The first President under the
                    constitution, Ramalho Eanes, had been the Army lieutenant colonel (and later a
                    general) who led the revolution. He had the feeling that the President needed to
                    be a power center, a powerful figure. This would have followed the pattern that
                    had been established by Salazar, for example, who had been Prime Minister under
                    a figure-head President. Well, the revolution was undoing everything. This was
                    to be a real President, elected to be President. Eanes felt that he should have
                    much broader powers, something closer to an American style presidential
                    system.</p>
                <p>Soares had disagreed with this view from his positions as Prime Minister, when he
                    was Prime Minister, and Foreign Minister, when he was Foreign Minister. He
                    attempted to moderate Eanes' view of the presidency. When he was in office as
                    President, Soares stuck to his guns. He felt that the presidency had real powers
                    but that he had to be very careful not to intrude on the powers that had been
                    written into the constitution for the government and the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>Soares was a Socialist. The government, when Soares was President, was Social
                    Democratic. There were times when the Portuguese Government did things that
                    Soares disagreed with, but he was careful to use his presidential powers
                    strictly within the limits of the constitution. He avoided overstepping those
                    powers.</p>
                <p>I had assumed that Soares would behave that way anyhow while I was en route to
                    Portugal to take up my post as Ambassador. During my first meeting with Soares
                    in the barber shop the day after I arrived in Lisbon, we talked a little bit
                    around this subject, but not in depth. I had a sense that I was right. When I
                    presented my credentials very shortly thereafter, and we had a private
                    conversation after the ceremony, I left that conversation, knowing that I had
                    been right. That brought me to the first major decision I had to make as
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Within a week after my arrival a major change was proposed for the charter that
                    governed the Luso-American Development Foundation. It was endowed primarily with
                    funds that had come from the Azores Base Agreement. The American member of a
                    troika of executive directors at the Foundation had wanted to stick very closely
                    to a developmentalist philosophy. The Portuguese executive directors — one of
                    them a Socialist and the other a Social Democrat — pushed for something that
                    came closer to meeting the political needs of the country. When Cavaco Silva, a
                    Social Democrat, became Prime Minister, he and the Social Democrat executive
                    director of the Foundation concluded that it was time to tighten up the charter
                    of the Foundation to give the government a little more say in its activities and
                    to reduce what Cavaco Silva perceived to be an excessive American role in
                    dictating the activities of the Foundation.</p>
                <p>The man who had been Charg� d'Affaires in the Embassy — at that point my DCM
                    [Deputy Chief of Mission] — came to me and said...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That was Wes Egan. Wes told me that a draft law to revise the charter of
                    the Foundation was moving through the Portuguese Government. The Foundation's
                    charter had been established by law. The effect of the law would be to increase
                    the size of the Board of Directors, increase the weight of the Portuguese
                    representatives, and thus make it more responsive to Portuguese national needs,
                    as perceived by the Portuguese directors. I was pressed to ask Mario Soares to
                    intervene and veto the law, which he could do. Then the law would have gone back
                    to the Portuguese Congress in a process similar to our veto override
                    process.</p>
                <p>I considered this and then rejected Wes' recommendation. I believed that it would
                    have put Mario Soares in a position of having to choose between the way he felt
                    that the presidency should relate to the government and a certain sense of
                    responsibility for Portuguese-US relations and the relationship with the US
                    Government. Never mind our personal relationship which, actually, was quite
                    good. It had been quite strong. I felt that this was not an issue that demanded
                    that weighty an outcome. This was, after all, a development foundation. It had a
                    limited endowment of $90 million whose purpose was to do good. These funds had
                    come from the US Government to the Portuguese Government under the Lajes Base
                    Agreements. In turn, the Portuguese Government had transferred this money to
                    endow the Foundation. Its purpose was to use the endowment as an instrument to
                    do good works that would have a Portuguese-American quality to them, in the
                    sense of long term cooperation. I felt that, had I supported Wes' request, we
                    would have been undoing that long term objective if I put the Portuguese
                    President in such an awkward position.</p>
                <p>This outcome would have been bad for the US-Portuguese relationship and,
                    ultimately, for the Foundation because a Presidential veto would have been
                    overridden in that particular case. It would have been the wrong thing to do. It
                    related to the way Soares was playing his role as President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about your relationship to the Portuguese
                        Government, in this case. What about your relationship to the American
                        Government? Where was the pressure for you to persuade him to veto this law
                        coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: On the whole, Washington didn't care. Washington would have cared if my
                    actions or my decisions had further complicated the situation affecting US use
                    of Lajes air force base in the Azores or had created some additional negative
                    aspects in the overall relationship, which could have complicated something
                    else. However, the kinds of concerns I have described were the kinds of things
                    that Washington usually left up to its Ambassador.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the pressure coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: It was essentially coming from the American executive director at the
                    Foundation, from some members of the American Community, and from within the
                    Embassy. They saw was a dilution or significant diminution of American influence
                    in the operations of the Foundation. They feared that significant politicization
                    in the use of its funds, corruption of its purposes.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 8, Side A of the interview with Ambassador Ed
                        Rowell. You were saying...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That was a real risk, and no question about it. In fact, there had been
                    at least one project, at the time I arrived in Portugal which had been approved
                    almost wholly on a political basis. It didn't have a good economic,
                    developmental, or people-centered purpose to it.</p>
                <p>However, in the end what I had counted on was the need of the Foundation and its
                    directors for survival. Survival would require that the Foundation not become
                    merely a political tool of any particular government, because when that
                    government fell the Foundation would end as well. Moreover, if the Foundation
                    had played that game, it probably would have started to draw down its endowment
                    at a rate that would have bankrupted it within a few years. In retrospect,
                    certainly during the time that I was there, there were no new special political
                    demands on the Foundation after the composition of the Board of Directors
                    changed. I really don't know what has happened since 1990 when I left Portugal.
                    This is now 1996, and I can say that the Foundation is active. It has projects
                    in the United States that help to tie American and Portuguese educators together
                    and to promote an understanding in the US of what Portugal is and its history.
                    The Foundation conducts other projects in Portugal and Africa. It has not
                    bankrupted. The Portuguese Government has changed, but the Foundation is still
                    in business. So I think that it has come out well.</p>
                <p>Now, back to the first question, which concerned Mario Soares. I've dealt with
                    the question of how he saw himself in the presidency. During his years as
                    President, and certainly during 1988-1990 when I was Ambassador to Portugal, he
                    sought to be the embodiment of the presidency as he had conceived of it when he
                    helped to write the constitution. So he was very circumspect in terms of when he
                    confronted the Government and when he did not. He tended to emphasize his role
                    in the foreign affairs field, which was a field substantially reserved to the
                    President, rather than to the Government. So much so that, for example, during
                    my two tours in Portugal, the Minister of Foreign Affairs typically would have a
                    meeting once a week with the President. In the conduct of foreign relations that
                    was a Presidential, not a Government responsibility, although the Government
                    maintained the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and provided its budget.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>Soares had become a kind of beloved, almost Teddy Bear like figure for the
                    Portuguese public. He is charismatic and warm. He puts his arm around people and
                    talks to them in a very human way. It is easy to see how he could be a
                    successful politician. People gravitate to him.</p>
                <p>During the period 1988-1990 he was nearing the end of his first five-year term as
                    President. He was going to run for a second term. The constitution permits up to
                    two consecutive terms. There could be more terms after a gap following the
                    second, consecutive term. He had undertaken a series of regional visits to
                    different parts of the country — to the Azores, to Madeira, to the northeastern,
                    remote part, the central, mountain part, and so on.</p>
                <p>I remember that on one Portuguese National Day — I think this was in June of 1988
                    or 1989 — he'd gone to a series of events in a place called Castelo Branco,
                    which is in the East Central part of the country near the Spanish border. The
                    weather was wet and cold. The town was going through a pageant that was part of
                    its medieval lore. There was Mario Soares, seated on a da�s, slightly raised,
                    with a cloak over his shoulders — the embodiment of a renaissance painting of
                    royalty in full regalia. There, on the stage, were lambs and kids [young goats]
                    with their feet bound so that they wouldn't run away. There were bales of hay,
                    baskets of potatoes, corn, and other foods, and a procession [passing the da�s]
                    of schoolchildren paying homage to the President in this medieval reenactment.
                    In the first place, it was touching. But it was also very funny that this
                    Socialist, who had helped to write a democratic constitution, was there in the
                    role of the king in that pageant.</p>
                <p>You need to remember that the Portuguese have a kind of myth about a man named
                    Sebasti�o, or Sebastian, who was a teen-aged king toward the end of the 16th
                    century. He led Portuguese nobles in a battle against the Moroccans at a place
                    in Morocco called El Ksar El Kbir, near the northwest coast of Morocco. Through
                    a series of misjudgments, the king and his nobles were all killed. There was no
                    immediate heir to the throne, and Spain took over the country. Portugal remained
                    under Spanish domination for the next 80 years or so. This is an important
                    element in a Portuguese schoolchild's history of the country. There are all
                    kinds of stories about Sebasti�o returning on his white horse from Morocco to
                    save Portugal — from what? Well, obviously, at the end of the 16th century, it
                    was from the Spaniards. But even today there is sometimes talk of Sebastianismo
                    — and that means dreaming about someone who arrives on a white horse to save
                    them from the crisis of the moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>Well, the Portuguese had been through a revolution and times were getting better.
                    However, for some people things were still tough, as they always are. For
                    somebody, in any country, things are always tough. So there was always an aura
                    of Sebastianismo about this. Soares was the man who, somehow or other, had led
                    that march down the Avenida da Liberdade in 1975, who had helped to write the
                    constitution, who had been Prime Minister, and who now was President. He was
                    sitting there, telling the Portuguese that things were going to be all right. He
                    was saying that Portugal was stable and was going to be safe. You could feel
                    that in the crowds. It was very, very interesting. Later the Diplomatic Corps,
                    including myself, accompanied Soares on a couple of his other regional visits,
                    including one to the Azores. These visits were good, but none of them had
                    medieval pageantry about them the way that event in Castelo Branco did. To me,
                    that one picture kind of summarized Soares' role in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew each other off and on for some years. Did he ever
                        talk to you about the American Government and the American presidency—just
                        to get a feel for how it worked? Did this ever come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. That subject never arose. His own model was France. He was aware of
                    the problems that France had encountered with its two constitutions of the
                    Fourth and Fifth Republics after World War II. He had attempted to deal with
                    those problems when he was helping to write the Portuguese constitution after
                    the revolution. Soares' education outside of Portugal had been in France. He is
                    a Francophile. He is very warm toward the United States but basically he is a
                    Francophile and was a personal friend of the late Fran�ois Mitterrand the former
                    French Socialist President, who held that job for 14 years. So he had looked to
                    France, both as a model and as a warning signal of the problems that could arise
                    in that constitutional model. He didn't really ask us how we worked. We are a
                    totally presidential system, as are the other governments of the Americas.</p>
                <p>He really didn't want a purely presidential style of government, partly because
                    he mistrusted it in the Portuguese cultural context. He feared that if you
                    concentrated as much power in one hand, as he perceived American Presidents to
                    have, then there would be a greater risk of a reversion to some new Antonio De
                    Salazar, Portuguese Prime Minister and de facto ruler from 1932 to 1968. He
                    deliberately split power between a Prime Minister and parliamentary government,
                    on the one hand, and the Presidency, on the other hand, to prevent any one
                    person from acquiring the level of power that Salazar had enjoyed. You need to
                    remember that during the Salazar-Caetano period, the President of Portugal was a
                    pure figurehead. The Portuguese President at that time had no power or authority
                    at all — much like the President of the Federal Republic of Germany today.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to capture something in a nutshell. You were an
                        American Ambassador. You grew up in the Foreign Service system. The
                        President of Portugal was a Socialist. How did you and, by extension, other
                        Americans, view socialism at that point—its strengths, weaknesses, and so
                        forth. Sometimes, socialism is almost a bad word in the American political
                        context.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The answer is that I've never bet on labels. I've always bet on what
                    facts and specific persons — how were things actually operating. Soares was a
                    dedicated Socialist, but he ran his governments and adopted policies geared to
                    market economy principles and to a limited role for government. Nobody ever
                    questions Soares' motivations or those of his party stalwarts who were in
                    government with him — nor, for that matter, the other democratic parties that
                    competed with them — in terms of their dedication to their country, to making
                    the economy work better, to seeing that people were better off, and to
                    consolidating democratic rule. Disagreements were on policies, how best to
                    arrive at the overall goals.</p>
                <p>So my problem as an Ambassador was to make sure that Washington looked through
                    the title of Socialist and at the realities. I met a lot of visiting American
                    businessmen who were coming through Portugal. We were actively promoting
                    American exports and, where it made good sense, American investment. I always
                    told them about the two times that Mario Soares was voted out of office because
                    he was straightening out the economy and cutting gross overspending. I said, “So
                    that's this Socialist. Think of him as the man who takes those kinds of
                    decisions when they're necessary. Don't think of him just as a socialist.”
                    That's a critical difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could talk a bit about the role of visits,
                        both official and others, to Portugal. I'm not talking about tourist visits,
                        but other visits, including Congressional visits. How did you as the
                        Ambassador structure these and what were you trying to gain from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I really have to break the answer to that into my two, separate stays in
                    Portugal. We had many more visits during my first years in Portugal in 1978-1982
                    than during 1983, and then during my return as Ambassador in 1988-1990.</p>
                <p>During those earlier years my objective was to get people to understand, first of
                    all, how close Portugal had been to a Communist take-over, and how much courage
                    the Portuguese has displayed in defeating that Communist effort. Second, I told
                    them what I just told you about Mario Soares as a Socialist. I wanted them to
                    understand that this was a man who was a democrat first of all. Third, I wanted
                    to help them see how the Portuguese were coping with all of the enormous
                    adjustments that they had to make following the revolution. Remember, in those
                    first years they did not yet belong to the European Community. They were having
                    to do things on their own as a separate country. They had had to absorb an
                    influx of people that amounted to roughly seven percent of the total population.
                    Think of that. If that were the US today, that would mean absorbing roughly 18
                    million people in the course of one year.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these people were hopping mad, too. We're talking
                        about the people coming to Portugal from the former African colonies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, they were mad, and so on. Portugal absorbed these people with great
                    skill. They had the resources to deal with them, but they also had liquidity and
                    budgetary problems. So my objective was the get American legislators and senior
                    American executive branch officials to see the scale of the problem in relation
                    to the size of the country. Secondly, to see how the Portuguese were addressing
                    these problems. Thirdly, to get them to see how the Portuguese were relating to
                    the United States, first of all, and then to the other NATO allies, since
                    Portugal was a NATO member. One of the prerequisites for being a member of NATO
                    was that the country must be democratic. There may have been some questions
                    about one or two of the members at one time or another earlier in NATO's
                    history, but at that point that was considered an absolute requirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Greece was one example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Finally, I sought to make sure that these senior American visitors
                    understood Portugal's role in NATO, both in terms of overall NATO strategy, and,
                    secondly, the role that Portugal had played vis-a-vis the United States during
                    certain crises, most particularly the Arab-Israeli conflicts in the Middle East
                    — the 1967 and the 1973 wars. For doing this Portugal had paid a certain price
                    in terms of its relationships with Arab nations. In that regard that had
                    affected the reliability of Portugal's energy imports, because Portugal has
                    always had to import energy — including petroleum products.</p>
                <p>So I regarded these visits as an opportunity for the visitors to see these
                    problems. The way I described them sounds as though I was reading from a book.
                    But these visits were an opportunity to meet the people who were managing these
                    problems. In other words, to meet Mario Soares, to meet a Prime Minister and a
                    Foreign Minister, and to make personal judgments about the caliber of these
                    people. Cavaco Silva has just left the government. He was voted out in December,
                    1995. He was Prime Minister for 10 years. He was the son of a gas station
                    attendant. He had managed to earn his education the hard way. He'd taken his Ph.
                    D. degree in economics at the University of York in England. He was a very
                    serious man with a very good sense of how you make a market economy work. He was
                    also interested in trying to make the system work so that the little guy was
                    taken care of; taken care of in the sense that he had his opportunities, was not
                    going to be allowed to starve, and his kids weren't going to die for lack of
                    inoculations or be crippled for lack of a doctor to set a broken bone. That sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>I wanted our legislators to sense, first of all, that the US had significant
                    security interests at stake. Secondly, that Portugal was a country whose values
                    meshed with ours. Thirdly, that it had leaders whose measure our Congressmen had
                    been able to take personally because they met and talked with them. The
                    Portuguese leaders knew what they were doing and merited our confidence. So, for
                    me, every one of these visits had a purpose and was useful. And, from my
                    personal point of view — and my wife shared that — it never hurts to know
                    another Congressman. We used these visits as opportunities to establish our own
                    personal relationships with individual Congressmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what context would you say that “it never hurts to know
                        another Congressman?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You never know when some Congressman is going to be sitting in a critical
                    chair in some committee or subcommittee that can affect our foreign relations.
                    Say that you've met the Congressman personally and he's sat with you in your
                    home. You've had a meal together and have called on significant personalities
                    together. You've followed this up by sitting down and chatting a little bit
                    about that meeting, about the personality involved, and what was going on. The
                    Congressman has had a chance to decide how good, or not so good, I was and to
                    know whether he feels comfortable with me, and so on. If the personal
                    relationship felt comfortable, I always felt that I could pick up a phone and
                    talk with the Congressman directly at some future time if that would help to
                    resolve an important foreign relations problem I was working on. Now, that might
                    not change the way things were going, but at least it gave me a real window.</p>
                <p>It's one thing, if you're calling cold and say that you're the Ambassador to X
                    country. The Congressman will be polite — he or she may not have met you. But if
                    he's met and talked with you, if he remembers you, that broadens the field in
                    terms of the ability to discuss the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems regarding Portugal in our Congress
                        during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The principal problems were related to the budget and the fact that it
                    was already shrinking substantially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the American budget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The American budget. We were cutting back dramatically on the types of
                    assistance that had been written into our agreements with Portugal. For example,
                    I had to renegotiate a base agreement to get the Portuguese to accept a lower
                    flow of assistance than we had promised. The year after I left that issue was on
                    the table again, and the assistance agreement was again being renegotiated down.
                    That was the main problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the French influence on Soares was
                        considerable. Portugal was part of NATO. The French were still playing this
                        game, begun by De Gaulle, of not being in the military part of NATO, yet
                        being in the North Atlantic Council. It was a very peculiar situation with
                        France. Did this have any impact on the Portuguese view and performance in
                        NATO, either military or political?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, France's decision to withdraw from NATO, the military structure under
                    the North Atlantic Treaty was strictly its own. The Portuguese were never
                    tempted to parallel it, for reasons of their own profound national interest.
                    First of all, they understood that the ability of the US to use Lajes Air Force
                    Base in the Azores to resupply Europe or Israel (as we had) or to ferry supplies
                    to the Persian Gulf area (as we had in 1990-91) was Portugal's single most
                    important contribution to NATO. They understood also that without that
                    contribution, there wasn't much of a Portuguese role in NATO, and Portugal's
                    status within Europe would decrease substantially.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, even though Soares and many Portuguese are Francophiles, raised in a
                    French-style educational system, Portugal's oldest treaty relationship is with
                    Britain. The Portuguese have what they call an Atlantic mentality, meaning that
                    they had looked to the sea. Their relationship with Spain is back to back. The
                    Portuguese spinal column is against the Spanish spinal column. Spain, as the
                    Portuguese presented it, was a Mediterranean country with classic Mediterranean
                    relationships with North Africa and with France. Portugal was Atlantic, with an
                    oceanic viewpoint that reached to Brazil and around the Cape of Good Hope to the
                    Indian Ocean and the Pacific Rim. So in terms of global situations and military
                    positions, strategies, and relationships, Portugal has kept itself allied with
                    Britain since the late fourteenth century. There were always tensions between
                    Portugal and Spain in the Iberian Peninsula. As I mentioned earlier in this
                    interview, the alliance between Portugal and Britain is based on one of the
                    oldest treaties still operating in the world. This set of treaties is still
                    called the “Treaties of Windsor,” dating from the 1380's. It is still in effect,
                    still invoked and applied, as of today at the end of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>Had Portugal attempted to do what De Gaulle did, the Portuguese would have been
                    ostracized in NATO. They weren't big enough to carry it off by themselves, and
                    they were never tempted to do it. It just ran totally against their “Atlantic”
                    interests as they perceived them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the role of the Portuguese Army
                        during this time. In the first place, during the time of the Portuguese
                        revolution, there was great concern in the United States, and I guess
                        elsewhere in NATO, about the Portuguese military sitting in on their plans.
                        It was felt that they might have a direct tie to the communists and, through
                        them, to the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. Had that had any impact? I
                        think that we had kind of frozen them out, hadn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>ROWELL: I think I answered this point earlier in the interview, but just for the
                    record...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm really talking about how they felt about it now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: After the revolution, when the communists were in key positions in
                    Lisbon, the Portuguese military representatives at NATO, unilaterally and on
                    their own initiative, absented themselves from those NATO meetings where, for
                    example, our nuclear strategy was being discussed. They refused to hold for
                    deposit, as they were entitled to hold, NATO documents related to NATO nuclear
                    strategy, as well as certain other military preparedness and planning documents.
                    They simply said that if they held the documents, they had to report to Lisbon
                    and forward them to Lisbon. They felt uncomfortable about that, given the
                    uncertainties surrounding what was happening in Lisbon. So they refused to take
                    possession of the documents. That was a decision unilaterally taken by the
                    Portuguese military representing Portugal in NATO. This decision wasn't
                    countermanded by Lisbon, because Lisbon was too busy in the immediate, post
                    revolutionary period.</p>
                <p>So NATO never had to say anything to the Portuguese military representatives.
                    NATO never took a resolution imposing anything on the Portuguese
                    representatives. NATO accepted this Portuguese initiative and lived by it.
                    During the 1980's and 1990's, those Portuguese military who were still on active
                    duty and who remembered the immediate post-revolutionary period — and remember
                    that I'm talking about it 15 years later — knew that what had happened had
                    occurred as a result of Portuguese initiative. They hadn't been run out of NATO.
                    They hadn't been chastised or had their personal relationships cut off or
                    anything like that. They had been treated with decency, and there were no
                    repercussions.</p>
                <p>They felt considerable frustration with NATO. They had not received the level of
                    military assistance that they expected, now that everything had settled down, to
                    help them convert their military structure to one wholly dedicated to NATO
                    purposes. By 1988 the main raison d'�tre of the Portuguese armed forces was to
                    perform a NATO role. That required an upgrade of the Air Force and the equipment
                    it had. It required a radical upgrade of the Navy and the equipment it had so
                    that it could play a much more significant role in the protection of the North
                    Atlantic sealanes in the context of anti submarine warfare. It meant some
                    significant reconfiguration within the Portuguese Army itself, so that it could
                    provide the rapid reaction forces that it had pledged to NATO.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>All of that required a lot of money. New jet airplanes are not cheap. Modern anti
                    submarine frigates are not cheap. Even modern Army equipment is not cheap. Take
                    a look at an American military unit, of the kind we have in Bosnia, for example.
                    Never mind the armor but just the battlefield electronics, which play an
                    enormous role today. The Portuguese Government didn't have the resources to buy
                    this kind of equipment. NATO pledged military assistance. It was slow in coming.
                    The process was cumbersome. The negotiation process on Portugal's three anti
                    submarine frigates ran on for six or seven years. That's where the Portuguese
                    armed forces felt their frustrations and resentments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Lisbon at the beginning of the crisis in the
                        Persian Gulf in 1990, when Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. I left Lisbon in April, 1990. Saddam Hussein did not seize Kuwait
                    until August, 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time that you were leaving Portugal, did you see

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The only cloud was the question of having to rewrite the base use
                    agreement covering Lajes Air Force Base in the Azores. US military assistance
                    had been cut well below the level that had been anticipated, and that primarily
                    impacted on the rate at which the Portuguese armed forces could equip themselves
                    for NATO missions. Although glasnost and perestroika had arrived, the Soviet
                    Union still existed.</p>

                    weapons, still a long way to go on the START II [Strategic Arms Reduction

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No. All of the consular functions ran normally. There was the usual flow
                    of Portuguese immigrants from the Azores and northern Portugal to areas in the
                    United States where Portuguese have typically concentrated. That is,
                    southeastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and California. There may have been
                    some shepherds from former Portuguese territories such as Cape Verde in Nevada
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The shepherds were usually Spanish Basques, but there had

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The flows were normal. There were no unusual demands for immigrant visas.
                    There was an aircraft crash in the Azores while I was in Lisbon as Ambassador, a
                    nasty one involving a charter airplane flying from Germany to the Dominican
                    Republic. I think that the aircraft was registered in the United States, so we
                    were involved. There were some Americans, although not too many, on that plane.
                    We had the usual emergency response team deal with that disaster.</p>
                <p>Apart from that there was the normal run of American citizen problems during the
                    tourist season, when people are being robbed, cars are broken into, and purses
                    snatched. It happens all over the world now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Where did I go and why did I leave Portugal? I left Portugal because the
                    President decided to appoint Ted Briggs...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was President George Bush.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>ROWELL: President George Bush had decided to appoint Everett E. [Ted] Briggs, a
                    career Foreign Service Officer, to Lisbon. Briggs had been serving in the White
                    House since May or June, 1989, the first year of the Bush administration. Some
                    time in August, 1990 President Bush decided that there needed to be a transfer.
                    Briggs had said that he wanted to go to Lisbon. The President approved his
                    transfer to Lisbon. Then the President told Secretary of State Baker to find
                    something for me, and the something they found was Luxembourg, which had just
                    come open because the President's nominee for Luxembourg, Frederick Bush — no
                    relation to the President — had withdrawn. The nomination was withdrawn during
                    the same week in which the President told Secretary Baker to send Briggs to
                    Lisbon. So this was a pair. That was it.</p>
                <p>I was appointed by the White House to go to Luxembourg on March 30 or 31, 1990. I
                    left Lisbon about April 1 or 2, 1990. I can get the exact dates from the record.
                    I went back to Washington, was sworn in as Ambassador to Luxembourg, and arrived
                    in Luxembourg in the third week of April, 1990. It was a very quick transfer. It
                    took less than three weeks, including my time in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to get this straight. You were in Luxembourg
                        from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I arrived in Luxembourg at the end of April, 1990, and I departed
                    Luxembourg at the beginning of August, 1994. So I was there for over four and a
                    quarter years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, when you were in EUR [Bureau of European
                        Affairs], Luxembourg came across your radar, but probably not as a major
                        concern.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No career officer ever thinks of going to Luxembourg. It is notoriously
                    one of those places where administrations send a non-career Chief of Mission. As
                    a career officer I couldn't refuse the offer of another mission without retiring
                    from active duty. So when Luxembourg arrived on my radar, at the end of August,
                    1989, I accepted the appointment. Luxembourg is in a pleasant part of Europe,
                    and I couldn't complain about that. But I did wonder, “What am I going to do
                    there? What does anybody do in Luxembourg?”</p>
                <p>The first feedback that I got came from my brother-in-law, an Exxon executive. He
                    said, “Well, it's a major financial center.” I said, “Oh.” And then, of course,
                    I got in touch with the desk in EUR which, in the case of Luxembourg, is a half
                    desk. The desk officer also covers another country. I asked the US Embassy in
                    Luxembourg to start sending me material on the country. My assignment to
                    Luxembourg became known almost immediately, because this was a rare case in
                    which the request for agr�ment went out before the security background check had
                    been conducted. I'm sure that it happened that way because both of us were
                    career officers. Each of us had had the full background check done before taking
                    up our then positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Ted Briggs and yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, Briggs and myself. So there was plenty of confidence that our
                    background checks would work out. So after having been informed about the change
                    in August, 1989, the request for agr�ment arrived within two weeks and was
                    accorded by the Luxembourg Government. In other words, virtually instantly. Each
                    mission in Lisbon and Luxembourg knew who the new ambassadorial candidate was.
                    In the case of Embassy Luxembourg they immediately began to send the Embassy in
                    Lisbon information copies of all of the principal messages they sent, so that,
                    by the time I arrived I would be well read in on whatever was going on.</p>
                <p>So what did I discover? I discovered that Luxembourg is extraordinarily friendly
                    toward the United States. It is indeed a major financial center in Europe. It is
                    properly jealous of its right to participate in all of the major international
                    organizations, including NATO, the European Union, the Western European Union,
                    the Council of Europe, and other organizations.</p>
                <p>Luxembourg takes seriously its role as a facilitator and plays it well. If I were
                    a mechanic, I would say as a lubricator. It is a facilitator among its partners
                    in all the international organizations it participates in, especially the
                    European organizations. In NATO the facilitative role hasn't had to be played
                    very often, but I can cite one example.</p>
                <p>In NATO the example arose when we wanted to deploy the AWACS, the Airborne
                    Warning and Control System aircraft. This happened before I arrived in
                    Luxembourg. The question was, “Where do you register these airplanes?” Each
                    country has its own rules on aircraft registration. Neither Germany nor any
                    other country wanted to have to register all of the AWACS aircraft. If some of
                    the aircraft were registered in one country and some in another country, that
                    would have meant that some planes had certain technical criteria to meet, while
                    others had other technical criteria. And NATO didn't want to have different
                    technical specifications for different aircraft in the AWACS fleet. The argument
                    was going around and around. Then the Luxembourg representative suggested a
                    coffee break. While the other members of NATO were busy getting coffee, the
                    Luxembourger went to a corridor telephone, talked with his Prime Minister, and
                    said, “I think that Luxembourg ought to take all of these aircraft.” When the
                    NATO meeting resumed, the Luxembourger came back into the room and told the
                    other NATO delegates, “Luxembourg will host the AWACS fleet.” That is typical of
                    the way that Luxembourg can make decisions. That was a conversation between the
                    Luxembourg representative to NATO and the Prime Minister. The whole decision was
                    made in 15 minutes. There were no problems within the Luxembourg cabinet or with
                    the Luxembourg legislature.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to your time in Luxembourg, was there any
                        problem in the withdrawal of an Ambassadorial appointee to be chief of
                        mission in Luxembourg? Often what happens is that political appointees are
                        sort of picked out of almost nowhere and, as things go, for one reason or
                        another they become less enamored of the appointment or the administration
                        becomes less enchanted with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: In the case of the nomination of Frederick Bush, some questions were
                    raised in the Senate about some aspect of his work. I think that it was with
                    HUD, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Just as in the case of my
                    transfer to Lisbon as Ambassador, I hadn't been paying any attention to that,
                    and I decided that it didn't make any difference to my role as the prospective
                    new Ambassador. So I didn't inform myself on whatever it was. But whatever these
                    considerations were, they were sufficient to convince Frederick Bush either that
                    he didn't want to drag all of that through the Senate hearing process or maybe
                    that he might not be confirmed. Whatever it was, Frederick Bush simply didn't
                    want to go through it, and so he withdrew. He later was appointed, I believe, to
                    a position that didn't require Senate confirmation, as the administration's
                    point man on US participation in the Seville World's Fair.</p>

                        invasion of Kuwait, as we mentioned before. Did Luxembourg become involved
                        in what became known as the Gulf War of 1990-1991?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. Two really big things happened in 1990. First, was the Iraqi seizure
                    of Kuwait in August, 1990. Second, was the physical collapse of the Berlin Wall
                    in November, 1990.</p>
                <p>In the governance of the European Union, then called the European Communities,
                    there is something called a troika. The troika consists of the current
                    President-in-Office (Prime Minister of the Presidency County) of the European
                    Union, his immediate predecessor in the Presidency and his immediate successor.
                    Each Presidency term lasts for six months. The Presidency rotates among the
                    member states of the European Union on a fixed schedule. Luxembourg entered the
                    troika in July, 1990. That first six-month period, as I said, saw the onset of
                    the Persian Gulf crisis which led to a shooting war in January, 1991; the
                    collapse of the Berlin Wall in November, 1990; and the dissolution of the Soviet
                    Union almost immediately after that.</p>

                <p>ROWELL: And the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and of the Eastern European
                    economic arrangement called COMECON [Council of Mutual Economic Assistance].
                    Luxembourg was President of the European Union during the first six months of
                    1991, when all of these things were impacting. Those were the same six months
                    when the Treaty of Maastricht was being drafted which converted the European
                    Economic Community into the European Union. Luxembourg presided over that effort
                    as well. So if ever you wanted action, Luxembourg had it — and I had it.</p>
                <p>It was an intensely active period. We were dealing with Luxembourg on a daily
                    basis, first in its role as a member of the troika, and then as Presidency
                    Country of the European Community on the European relationship to the military
                    buildup in the Persian Gulf. The US was handling much of the coordination of
                    Persian Gulf preparations in NATO, but we had to work closely with the European
                    Union, because it is in the European Union where the European powers coordinate
                    among themselves on their policies, including foreign policy (when they want it
                    coordinated, as in the Gulf case) and assistance policy. Even today, in
                    connection with the Middle East peace process, the West Europeans' very
                    substantial assistance to the Middle East is coordinated through the European
                    Union, not NATO.</p>
                <p>Our Embassy in Luxembourg was deeply engaged in terms of managing US-European
                    solidarity vis-a-vis Saddam Hussein during that five-month August-January period
                    Secretary of State Baker was attempting to persuade Tariq Aziz, Saddam's Foreign
                    Minister, to withdraw from Kuwait and not to force us to get into a shooting
                    war. During that period France kept wanting to talk separately with Saddam
                    Hussein and also with Iran. Luxembourg played a central role, its facilitator
                    role, if you will, in maintaining European solidarity and cohesiveness, a
                    cohesiveness that paralleled our own approach. That was intended to ensure that
                    Saddam Hussein would have no illusion that somehow the United States might try
                    to do something in the Persian Gulf area which the European countries wouldn't
                    support. It was also intended to make clear that he could not count on the
                    Europeans to prevent any serious measures from being taken against Iraq in
                    response to his aggression against Kuwait.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>Then, with Luxembourg as Presidency Country during the first six months of 1991,
                    we had the Gulf War, the immediate reactions to the dissolution of the Soviet
                    Union, including German unification, and the beginning of civil war in what was
                    then Yugoslavia. We were talking with the Europeans in NATO but also directly
                    and on a bilateral basis with the Europeans as they coordinated their policies
                    on assistance to Central Europe. We began to think about the relationship of
                    Central Europe to the European Union and about how to deal with a separate
                    Ukraine, Belorus, and the newly independent Baltic states. We were doing all of
                    that through Luxembourg. On the Yugoslav front, the Germans were insisting on
                    recognizing Croatia and Slovenia as independent countries. This recognition
                    triggered the flight to independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Serbs'
                    effort to create a “Greater Serbia”. There was major confrontation between the
                    Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, Montenegro, and between Macedonia and Greece. We
                    saw the start of ethnic conflict in Moldova and in the Caucasus. And a frantic
                    scramble to use every device available — for example, the Council of Europe and
                    the Conference (now “Organization”) on Security and Cooperation in Europe, CSCE
                    — to contain and deal with the emerging problems. It was a very busy period.</p>
                <p>The Embassy in Luxembourg was very small. There were three substantive officers
                    in the Embassy: myself; my DCM, and the economic officer. During my first two
                    years there the DCM was an FS-OC [rank of Counselor Foreign Service Officer],
                    and during my last two years he was an FSO-1 Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The first DCM was David Dlouhy. He was there during Luxembourg's period
                    in the troika. The second DCM was Bill Harris, William Harris. Dlouhy went from
                    Luxembourg to be DCM in La Paz, Bolivia. Harris later went to be DCM in
                    Asuncion, Paraguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your relationship with the Luxembourg
                        Government. In the first place, perhaps you could describe the Luxembourg
                        Government—the Foreign Ministry and how you felt about them. Say something
                        about their competence and how it worked. Each country has a different way
                        of working.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Right. Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy. The monarch is a Grand
                    Duke. The government is Parliamentary in structure. The legislature is
                    unicameral. There is a Chamber of Deputies but no Senate or House of Lords.
                    There is a Council of State that performs some of the functions that, for
                    example, Britain assigns to the House of Lords. The members of the Council of
                    State, I believe, are appointed for life by the Grand Duke, on the
                    recommendation of the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>Luxembourg's governments have been coalitions since the 1920's. They are
                    extraordinarily stable. Typically, a prime minister will serve for three and
                    sometimes four five-year legislative periods. As in all parliamentary
                    governments, a vote of no confidence can force an election, but there have been
                    no forced elections within memory. Governments have served the full five-year
                    period that the constitution allows governments to serve. The dominant party is
                    the Christian Democratic Party. Until 1980 the leading opposition party was
                    something called the Democratic Party, a liberal party in the sense of the
                    British Liberal Party. Since the mid-1980's the second largest party, and the
                    coalition partner, has been the Socialist Party. The Luxembourg Socialists are
                    social democratic in their policies.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Luxembourg, the Socialist leader (who was not the president of
                    the party) had taken over the Defense as well as the Foreign Ministry following
                    the 1989 elections. His name was Jacques Poos. In the previous 1984-89
                    government he had not held the Defense Ministry and he had criticized
                    Luxembourg's defense expenditures. I had a sense of deja vu, because I
                    remembered how Henry Kissinger had worried when a quintessential Socialist,
                    Mario Soares, became Foreign Minister and then Prime Minister of Portugal. I
                    knew also that my predecessor in Luxembourg had worried that the Socialists were
                    moving in, and maybe this would complicate NATO's life. She feared they might
                    even dismantle their army altogether.</p>
                <p>I told the DCM that I was going to talk with this man. My experience with Western
                    European socialists is that they are patriots first. They are democrats second.
                    And they are socialists third. I didn't think that we had to worry. I talked
                    with Poos and I knew immediately that we didn't have to worry. Besides that, he
                    was in a coalition government with Christian Democrats, about whom no one was
                    raising any questions. I told Washington immediately, “Stop fussing. This
                    country will do whatever is necessary to preserve NATO's integrity, to preserve
                    the integrity of Europe's defense, and to preserve Europe as a modern, market
                    economy, democratic structure.” I was correct.</p>
                <p>Luxembourg is a country that prepares its leaders extremely well. It picks them
                    way ahead of time and grooms them. All of their leaders hold advanced university
                    degrees. All of them have worked in the political vineyards for an extended
                    period of time. Beyond that there is a degree of national consensus that is
                    rare. That comes from being a very small country, a country slightly smaller
                    than Rhode Island in area and with a population of 400,000. They all know each
                    other personally and talk when they bump into each other on the street. Take the
                    man who was the Embassy's driver. I'm being very careful not to call him my
                    chauffeur, although he drove me on occasion. He did all of the other driving for
                    the Embassy, too. It was not an Embassy which had two or three drivers. There
                    was just the one driver. He had gone to high school with the Prime Minister.
                    They talked with each other on a first name basis. It's that kind of a
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>When they were preparing to fill the Presidency of the European Union, they
                    called in their Ambassadors from all over the world. Their Foreign Ministry at
                    the time had 60 people working for it, including all of their overseas
                    diplomatic representatives. That's the worldwide figure. They handed to each one
                    of their Ambassadors a portfolio. Somebody would watch the Latin America account
                    for the European Union. Someone else would watch the African, Near East, or
                    Asian account. They divided up the world and told their Ambassadors that during
                    Luxembourg's Presidency of the European Union, their sole priority was their
                    European Union portfolio. They handed out these portfolios a year before
                    Luxembourg assumed the Presidency of the European Union. Those Ambassadors were
                    already preparing for it when Luxembourg entered the troika. When Luxembourg was
                    in the Presidency, the Ambassadors were either in Luxembourg or in Brussels.
                    They were wherever they needed to be to chair the necessary meetings. They had
                    done their homework, they had learned their briefs, they had internalized them,
                    and Luxembourg ran a very tight ship.</p>
                <p>Luxembourg's present Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, was Finance Minister at
                    the time Luxembourg was President of the European Union. He is still Finance
                    Minister, in fact. During the first six months of 1991 he chaired all of the
                    meetings of the European Communities' Finance Council. Those were the meetings
                    at which the Treaty of Maastricht's provisions on Economic and Monetary Union
                    were drafted. The bases for monetary union, the rules for a European Monetary
                    Institute, the criteria for eligibility to be in the monetary union, the rules
                    for how to monitor the criteria were all written under the direction of
                    Luxembourg's present Prime Minister. He won enormous kudos from all of the other
                    Finance Ministers of the European Community. He was always fully prepared for
                    each meeting. He knew the agenda. He talked with each of the other Finance
                    Ministers privately before each meeting, understood the limits of their
                    flexibility, where there was consensus, and where there were differences.
                    Altogether, he ran a very constructive process.</p>
                <p>He is one of the people whom the Luxembourg political establishment spotted 20
                    years ago and started to groom. He is from an old political family. The
                    Luxembourg leaders bypassed several older members of his family who held
                    important, elective office. They said, “This is the one who has the real talent”
                    and they brought him along. He is also Minister of Labor and spends a lot of
                    time worrying about the welfare of ordinary working people.</p>
                <p>Other cabinet ministers have been equally well prepared, and certainly all of
                    their Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers, Defense Ministers, and Finance
                    Ministers. It's a very serious place. They know that they are small, and the
                    only way that they can perform any kind of credible role is by preparing well
                    ahead of time. They are the antithesis of Mediterranean improvisation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see also that Luxembourg has this role. It's not a
                        threat to the prestige of France, Germany, or Britain. That sort of thing
                        just wouldn't intrude because here is somebody who, nobody can say is
                        against them. Someone could say that Germany is one up on the French or vice
                        versa. However, no one could say anything like that about Luxembourg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: One of the roles that Luxembourg has played is as a go between between
                    France and Germany. They play this role by force of personality, not by power.
                    You are absolutely right. Luxembourg can't threaten anybody. So when Luxembourg
                    plays a facilitative role, you don't have the other parties, say, France,
                    Germany or Britain, immediately asking, “What's in it for them? Which national
                    benefit are they busy trying to scoop up now?” Even if there were a national
                    benefit involved, it couldn't be big enough to take anything significant away
                    from anybody else, anyhow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were able to interpret this role of
                        Luxembourg into an understanding back in Washington that we could help
                        Luxembourg be a tool? You mentioned a number of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: No, we don't have to help Luxembourg be a tool. Its way of operating is
                    in Luxembourg's national interest. They look after it. Their effectiveness
                    depends on their credibility with their European partners. They know it. There
                    is no way that we could make any difference in that. They have to deal with that
                    themselves. They retain their credibility by being a serious country, by having
                    competent people who are well prepared. They send good people to conferences and
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>They proved their utility within NATO on such things as the AWACS registration
                    issue. They proved their seriousness in the Yugoslav case, when the Europeans
                    finally decided that they had to send peacekeeping forces to Voivodina in
                    Slavonia, in eastern Croatia, on the frontier between eastern Croatia and
                    Serbia. The Europeans were having trouble deciding who was going to provide
                    troops, how many, and all of those kinds of things. The US was not participating
                    at all. Luxembourg participated in the Belgian battalion with a platoon, which
                    isn't a big unit. But they maintained a platoon there for two and a half years.
                    Relative to the size of their Army, this was a major contribution. When
                    eventually they had exhausted their manpower pipeline, they had to withdraw from
                    that participation for a year and a half or two years before they had trained
                    new forces to do the job. During the hiatus in their participation, they made a
                    cash contribution to Belgium to defray the cost of an additional Belgian
                    platoon. When we were in the Gulf War and were asking for contributions from our
                    European allies, I went in and asked the Luxembourgers to contribute to the
                    transport of forces to the Persian Gulf and then their return. Immediately, they
                    came back and said, “Yes. Here are $5.0 million.” This was from a country of
                    400,000 people. They gave us the $5.0 million and said, “If you can, try to use
                    our cargo airline's airplanes Boeing 747s. But if that doesn't work for any
                    reason at all, you're free to use it wherever you have to.”</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>Luxembourg has maintained an assistance program in Africa for many years. For
                    example, we had some significant programs going in West Africa. Their
                    contribution to one project was in-country transportation for the US AID
                    mission. They leased an airplane and provided the pilot, fuel, and maintenance,
                    so that our people in that country could get around to the project sites and
                    monitor them properly. In East Africa Luxembourg provided more direct assistance
                    of one kind or another. Typically, they provide assistance in cooperation with
                    other countries — again, because the size of the country doesn't permit them to
                    run a program all by themselves. Where they consider it important for Europe or
                    the world to do something about a problem, they put their money where their
                    mouth is. That is another way of earning credibility.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their role in the events that led to the fall of
                        the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Bloc, the end of the Soviet empire
                        and all of that during the time that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Berlin Wall and the Soviet empire fell because of internal rot. What
                    NATO had done was to maintain a containment vessel around the Soviet empire so
                    that eventually rot could resolve the matter.</p>
                <p>Luxembourg had always supported the integrity and cohesion of NATO. It had always
                    been positively disposed toward US initiatives in NATO. When there were problems
                    with the deployment of Pershing surface-to-surface missiles in Germany to
                    counterbalance Soviet SS-20 missiles, Luxembourg was not a problem, even though
                    there were people who worried about our transiting Luxembourg with equipment for
                    the Pershings'. Luxembourg was always on the side where Britain and the US found
                    themselves. If there was an intervention to be made and a vote was involved,
                    they always took the right side, although on strategic issues like that they
                    were not big players and they knew it. They tended not to say anything. However,
                    if we needed permission to transport nuclear materials across Luxembourg, we got
                    it. If something was going to have to remain in Luxembourg for a few days,
                    somehow or other it could always be arranged.</p>
                <p>The US maintained a major maintenance and storage depot in Luxembourg. It did not
                    include atomic material, but it had big tanks, heavy artillery, and that kind of
                    thing. There was never a problem with that. In fact, they were always very
                    helpful in terms of selecting the right site and making sure that the
                    transportation net was adequate and suitable.</p>
                <p>In the negotiations in Vienna on conventional forces in Europe; in what was
                    happening in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has
                    since become the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe; in the
                    surroundings and internal discussions in Vienna on nuclear negotiations with the
                    Soviet side — the Luxembourgers were consistently helpful in terms of what we
                    wanted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in this? You were talking about an
                        extremely competent government which was doing just what we would want it to
                        do. What did the American Ambassador to Luxembourg do during this really
                        important period as relationships were changing in Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: First of all, my role was to convey to the Luxembourg Government the
                    information that we had on what was happening behind the Iron Curtain or in the
                    Persian Gulf — and how things were moving. Secondly, it was to solicit what
                    their views were. Thirdly, ask how talks were moving within the European
                    Community and among the European ministers as they were concerting their
                    position — what problems there were and what we could do to enable them to stick
                    to positions that, from our point of view, would be most helpful. They discussed
                    the issues frankly, openly, and honestly with us. Things worked well.</p>
                <p>You know, in late 1990, as the Persian Gulf crisis became tighter, Saddam Hussein
                    of Iraq dug his position in deeper, and the French became more anxious to deal
                    directly and unilaterally with Saddam. A series of ploys emerged within the
                    European Community that, under the rules of the Community, forced the French to
                    concert with the other Western European countries — with Germany, Britain, and
                    others. The French finally broke out and sent a unilateral mission to Baghdad
                    only 24 hours before the bombing started. Up to then, by one device or another,
                    the French didn't send this mission. I attribute much of this to the internal
                    workings of the European Community and the way it managed its external affairs
                    on the political side within the European Council. In that regard the
                    Luxembourgers knew the rules of the game within the European Union and played
                    them well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense any feeling that the Luxembourgers at the
                        official level would prefer to have a professional Foreign Service Officer
                        sent to them as American Ambassador, as opposed to a non professional
                        Ambassador? One always thinks of Perle Mesta former American Minister to
                        Luxembourg—in other words, social type Ambassadors. Or were they too polite
                        to say anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Luxembourgers want a serious American Ambassador. They want somebody
                    who can get things done in Washington and who can make sure that their views are
                    taken with some degree of seriousness. They want to be seen as a serious player
                    on the European scene. Lord knows that their status as a financial center makes
                    them serious to their European partners. The way that they have played their
                    role in the troika and in the Presidency of the European Union when it has come
                    up also makes their partners take them seriously.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>I think that it is not so much a distinction between a career and a non career
                    Ambassador as between those Ambassadors who understand what role Luxembourg can
                    play and who support that kind of a role and other Ambassadors. Given the range
                    and complexity of issues we were confronting, it was important that the US
                    Ambassador be able to discuss the issues with the Foreign Minister in depth and
                    with substantial knowledge, confidence and insight. I played that role. I have
                    every reason to think that they felt that their relationship with the United
                    States was excellent and serious during my stay there.</p>
                <p>My successor is a non career Ambassador. However, he is extremely well connected
                    politically and has been effective in getting the Luxembourg Prime Minister in
                    to see President Clinton and the Secretary of the Treasury, his opposite number,
                    since he is also Finance Minister of Luxembourg. I think that they have had a
                    serious American Embassy to deal with as well.</p>
                <p>Luxembourgers also appreciate Ambassadors who get out into the countryside, who
                    talk to the mayors, visit the villagers, and that sort of thing. I did that, and
                    my successor has done that. I know that some of my predecessors did that.
                    Incidentally, Perle Mesta did that when she was Minister to Luxembourg. Because
                    she was known in Washington as a socialite, people tended to underrate her role.
                    Perle Mesta was a serious political figure in the United States. She happened to
                    play politics via a social mechanism. However, since she was a serious political
                    figure, she used that particular style very effectively as Minister to
                    Luxembourg at a time when that style was rare among diplomats. That upset a lot
                    of people, including people in the Department of State and our career diplomats.
                    There was a lot of friction between her and the career officers assigned to the
                    Legation in Luxembourg. However, in retrospect, she should be given a lot of
                    credit for what she accomplished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably one of the most divisive developments between the
                        European Community and the United States has involved agricultural issues.
                        Did you find yourself up to your neck in soybeans or the equivalent
                        thereof?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, although that's a field in which Luxembourg plays almost no role.
                    Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community a farm had to
                    operate at a certain level before it was eligible for Community subsidies.
                    Luxembourg's farms were too small to qualify for many of those subsidies. They
                    benefited from the price supports in a general way and received some subsidies
                    from the Luxembourg Government. However, total agricultural production in
                    Luxembourg is quite limited, even though it is a generally green country. Over
                    the years since World War II, for example, the area of Luxembourg that is
                    forested has risen from 10 percent of its surface to over one-third — 35
                    percent. Luxembourg has long had an agricultural subsidy program which allowed
                    farmers to do nothing more than just to keep agricultural land green.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Luxembourg farmers grow rape seed, they have dairy cattle and hogs, although
                    lately hogs have been unprofitable and the farmers have been getting out of the
                    business of raising pork. Luxembourg hams, Ardennes hams, are a famous European
                    commodity, although production of them has been going down because they haven't
                    been profitable enough. Luxembourg just isn't big enough to be a major actor in
                    that field. When we were busily engaged in fighting with the European Community
                    in the Uruguay Round of trade and tariff negotiations, and the critical sticking
                    points dealt with the Community's Common Agricultural Policy, what we got from
                    Luxembourg was some insight into what was propelling the French, German, Dutch,
                    and Belgian positions. Our enhanced understanding of the internal dynamics on
                    the European side, the realities on the European side of the equation, helped
                    the negotiations to conclude successfully. However, Luxembourg itself was not a
                    heavy hitter in those negotiations.</p>
                <p>When I speak of internal European dynamics, I mean something like the following.
                    The French would say that proposed reductions in the way the Common Agricultural
                    Policy was helping them would be catastrophic for France. The other European
                    countries would understand that without some concessions to the US on
                    agriculture, the negotiations would fail. They also knew there were many other
                    high priority European interests that depended on Uruguay Round success —
                    especially industrial and urban interests. So the other European countries would
                    begin to discuss with France how they could compensate for the expected losses
                    to its agricultural sector. That enabled the Europeans to arrive at a consensus
                    that allowed them and us to negotiate a successful conclusion to the Uruguay
                    Round.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the ties between the United States and
                        Luxembourg? During World War II the two major battles in Europe where
                        American troops were involved were D-Day the landing in Normandy in June,
                        1944 and then Bastogne the defense of a vital road hub during the Battle of
                        the Bulge in December, 1944. Did Bastogne, which is in Belgium, about two
                        miles from the Luxembourg border and the area around it play much of a role
                        from your point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Luxembourgers have a fondness for Americans that literally exceeds
                    anything anywhere else in the world. It is a country in which half of the
                    villages fly American flags because they want to. Virtually every village in
                    Luxembourg has a monument or a plaque dedicated to some American soldier who
                    died there, as the Luxembourgers see it, helping to liberate Luxembourg and to
                    save its children. United States forces have liberated Luxembourg three times:
                    once, during World War I, again, in September, 1944, and once again at the
                    conclusion of the Battle of the Bulge. That is to say, January-February,
                    1945.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>Luxembourg has had a history of being dominated for roughly 500 years from the
                    15th to the 20th century. As they put it to me, and to many other Americans, the
                    United States Army is the only liberating force that ever left the country
                    voluntarily. They really appreciate that. Luxembourg is a country in which a
                    uniformed American serviceman can go into a small village and discover that he
                    will not be allowed to pay for his beer. This is still the case today.
                    Luxembourger families that adopted the graves of American servicemen at the
                    American Military Cemetery in Hamm in the 1950s still maintain that adoption and
                    that commitment to this day. The grandchildren are brought to the cemetery and
                    told that every year you put flowers on this grave on the serviceman's birthday.
                    They may send postcards to the serviceman's family — although now they are sent
                    to the serviceman's grandchildren. So you see them decorating American
                    servicemen's graves there every year, with the whole Luxembourger family
                    participating, including grandparents, parents, and grandchildren. They are
                    still building monuments and putting up plaques to American servicemen.</p>
                <p>The Battle of the Bulge was a cruel experience in Luxembourg. The country had
                    mostly escaped damage in World War II until the Battle of the Bulge. The
                    American force that was in Luxembourg at the time of the battle was very thin.
                    It was the Pennsylvania National Guard Division, the 28th or Keystone infantry
                    Division. It had suffered grievous losses in the Battle of the Huertgen Forest,
                    which is East of the German-Belgian frontier in the vicinity of Aachen. It was
                    pulled out of the line and sent to Luxembourg to regroup, receive
                    reinforcements, and do a little refreshment training before going back into
                    battle. That Division was guarding a line 45 miles long, when the Germans came
                    through on December 16, 1944, in their final assault of the war.</p>
                <p>The German plan was to be past Bastogne in 24 hours. The American 101st Airborne
                    Division, the Screaming Eagles, Brig Gen McAuliffe's division (McAuliffe was
                    actually the deputy division commander but on scene and in command when the
                    battle started) is famous for its defense of Bastogne. But it was in northern
                    France on December 16 and didn't arrive in Bastogne until a day or two later.
                    The Pennsylvania 28th Infantry Division delayed the German assault by 96 hours
                    and was virtually destroyed in the process. That delay enabled the 101st
                    Airborne Division to get to Bastogne. Without control of Bastogne, the Germans
                    were unable to move enough supplies to the panzer tanks to enable them to get
                    all the way to the English Channel coast. The order came down from General
                    Eisenhower's headquarters to Division and Regimental levels, “You will hold at
                    all costs,” meaning, “Die if you must, but hold on.”</p>
                <p>The Pennsylvania 28th Division doesn't get nearly the credit it deserves for its
                    initial defense of Bastogne. It was an amazing feat, and the Luxembourgers
                    recognize it every year. In the end elements of some 28 US divisions were
                    involved in the final liberation of Luxembourg. They have the most moving
                    military museum that I have seen anywhere that focuses on the Battle of the
                    Bulge. It has incredibly realistic dioramas based on photographs taken during
                    the battle, plus letters and photographs of participants in the battle. American
                    veterans go to Luxembourg every year. They are received with incredible warmth.
                    Luxembourg is a very special place.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>Incidentally, since we're talking about World War II, the Grand Duke of
                    Luxembourg, who is a Colonel in the Irish Guards, landed with the British forces
                    in Normandy 24 hours after D-Day that is, on D+1 and was with those forces all
                    through the European campaign. It was an enormous risk for a royal house to take
                    with the heir to the throne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk about the precipitous recognition of Croatia
                        by Germany and that whole development from your perspective as one of the
                        nearby observers of the breakup of Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Federal Republic of Germany has had a sort of crisis of conscience
                    with regard to Yugoslavia and particularly with regard to the role which German
                    or Nazi forces played in Croatia and Serbia during World War II, especially in
                    Croatia. When Croatia was pressing for recognition as an independent country,
                    the German authorities felt that the demand from its electorate to recognize
                    Croatia's independence was irresistible. They felt that they had to do it. They
                    had wanted to recognize Croatia's independence as early as July, 1990.</p>
                <p>Then began a long, long process of trying to persuade them to hold off. Just as
                    Luxembourg and the other European countries had managed to keep France from
                    going unilateral in the case of Iraq in 1990, they kept holding the Germans back
                    on Croatia. During Luxembourg's presidency of the European Union they held the
                    Germans back until the middle of 1991. Finally, the Germans said that they were
                    going to recognize Croatia anyhow. All of the other Europeans understood that
                    the Germans were going to do it but had held off as long as they could until
                    they had to go ahead. Virtually everyone, including the US, told the Germans,
                    “Don't do it.” The Germans replied that for their own domestic, internal
                    reasons, they would do it, and they did it.</p>
                <p>When Germany recognized Croatia and Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro
                    declared their independence. That created a situation in which Serbia became the
                    rump Yugoslavia. Part of the assertion of Serbia's independence and integrity
                    then became a battle to extend its territorial domain, a thrust that Croatia
                    aped simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Now, I was Ambassador to Luxembourg, not Yugoslavia. There are others who know
                    Yugoslavia much better than I. However, I would say that Milosevic, the
                    President of Serbia, was driven primarily by political power and not by
                    nationalist motivations. However, he used nationalism as a device to gain power.
                    Similarly, President Tudjman in Croatia was using Croatian nationalism and
                    independence as devices to consolidate his own power. So once German recognition
                    had come, the collapse of Yugoslavia, the civil war, and the engagement of the
                    United Nations — all of that became inevitable. Who knows. Maybe it was
                    inevitable in any case.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Luxembourg see the problem as it was developing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Absolutely, as did everybody else. I must say that I had long
                    conversations with Luxembourger officials, and their appreciation of what was
                    happening in Yugoslavia was no different from ours. I think that we helped to
                    inform them. At a later stage, as things got worse, the European Union sent
                    negotiators to the newly-independent states of the former Yugoslavia. These
                    negotiators were trying to persuade them not to engage in a civil war and were
                    offering economic assistance as inducements. That happened during Luxembourg's
                    presidency of the European Union.</p>
                <p>A young officer in the Luxembourg Foreign Ministry became THE principal note
                    taker for these conversations. He was on the ground in the former Yugoslavia
                    week after week. When the European Union appointed Lord Carrington to be its
                    chief negotiator, Carrington insisted that the young Luxembourg diplomat be
                    seconded to him as his de facto aide de camp and head of office, or chef de
                    cabinet, in the French phrase for it. It's like a senior internal executive for
                    this matter. It was a tribute to the quality of the people that Luxembourg
                    appoints to its government service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 15, 1996. This is a continuation of the
                        interview with Ambassador Ed Rowell. Ed, could we mention money laundering,
                        COCOM, and plain bilateral relations between Luxembourg and the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Let's start with money laundering. Because Luxembourg is a major
                    financial center, we needed to look at how funds derived from drug trafficking
                    might have been channeled into or through Luxembourg. The United States
                    Government was trying to crack down on drug traffickers partly by interdicting
                    or seizing their financial assets. In fact, from information which DEA got by
                    infiltrating drug trafficking organizations...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: DEA is the Drug Enforcement Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>ROWELL: The Drug Enforcement Administration obtained this information by
                    infiltrating drug trafficking organizations inside the United States. They were
                    able to track the origins of certain bank accounts in the US. From those we were
                    able to go to the Luxembourg authorities with specific bank account numbers..
                    Under their law, when you came to them looking for particular accounts you could
                    then have access to the information. We then managed to track down over $40
                    million in drug trafficking assets. When we brought this to the attention of the
                    Luxembourg authorities, they promptly impounded them. Subsequently, they
                    indicted and prosecuted a couple of people related to the Colombian drug cartel
                    for money laundering. The persons indicted were convicted and served jail time
                    in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg authorities have cooperated in a large number of
                    ongoing indictments inside the US, providing some hard evidence and certainly
                    going through the deposition and letters rogatory process with persons whom they
                    had jailed in Luxembourg when they were caught for drug trafficking. This has
                    proved of inestimable value to various United States attorneys in different
                    districts of the United States.</p>
                <p>Luxembourg was a member of the Financial Action Task Force that drew up
                    guidelines for a new set of rules governing bank procedures and bank policy
                    among the members of the European Union. In the Luxembourg case they passed the
                    law well before the guidelines were approved. I might point out that the
                    Financial Action Task Force included representatives from the United States
                    Treasury Department. Even before those guidelines were developed and approved,
                    Luxembourg had changed its own national laws on the responsibility of financial
                    institutions to make it possible to certify to the bona fides of the ultimate
                    beneficiary of any account that might be opened inside Luxembourg. Their rules
                    on reporting transactions above a certain level were also very tight — tighter
                    than US rules, because in the Luxembourg case they included deposits of anything
                    of significant value, including gems or monetary metals — platinum, silver,
                    gold, and that sort of thing. If these items of value were deposited within a
                    certain time frame, this could constitute a significant amount of money.</p>
                <p>Because the ultimate Luxembourg unit of account in terms of transactions is the
                    European Currency Unit, the ECU, which is worth substantially more than the US
                    dollar, the reporting thresholds in their guidelines were lower than ours
                    according to the way the formulas worked — but don't ask me what the formulas
                    were. The Luxembourg guidelines were more comprehensive in terms of what
                    constituted value.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>Their system for enforcement is rather informal, but it works. Included in the
                    office of the Director of the Luxembourg Monetary Institute, which in essence is
                    the Luxembourg Central Bank, are persons responsible for monitoring banking
                    operations. These people call in the president of any Luxembourg branch of a
                    financial institution which is beginning to have deposit records that look
                    unusual or suspect. These officials of financial institutions are required to
                    show why the deposits are not unusual or suspect. The financial institution
                    officials are then cautioned and told that the banking authorities are going to
                    watch very closely both their activities, the transactions of the bank involved,
                    and so on. This has a chastening effect on bankers. I cannot tell you how many
                    times I received complaints from the heads of a number of financial
                    institutions, saying that they really did not enjoy the almost carte blanche
                    right of the Luxembourg monetary authorities to look over their shoulders and
                    second guess their judgments as to who is a bona fide depositor and who is
                    not.</p>
                <p>What put teeth in this practice is the fact that the bank officers were
                    considered criminally liable if their institution accepted a non bona fide
                    deposit. In this case bona fide means that the ultimate beneficiary of the
                    account is a person of good repute who did not derive the sums of money
                    deposited in an illegal fashion.</p>
                <p>In fact, subsequent to my departure from Luxembourg, the Luxembourg authorities
                    brought charges against the heads of a couple of banks in cases where the DEA
                    and the US Government were not involved. The charges stuck. So they take this
                    very, very seriously. Seriously, because Luxembourg depends on its reputation
                    for probity and as a safe environment in order to attract deposits from very
                    conservative people, like rural Germans. Luxembourg also offers bank secrecy,
                    reasonably attractive interest rates, and no tax withholding at the source. But
                    in the Central European psyche probity and conservatism are very important,
                    too.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: The Luxembourg Government supervises the financial community as well as
                    it can with its limited resources. To help maintain a high reputation for
                    probity, the government has been anxious to cooperate with the United States and
                    with its European partners in fighting money laundering.</p>
                <p>There was another case that involved the United States. That was the BCCI [Bank
                    of Credit and Commerce International], which was owned by one of the Arab
                    Emirates.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. It had branches in many parts of the world. Its original
                    charter in Europe was in Luxembourg, because it was an easy place to set up a
                    bank. In fact, its main operation center was in London. The office in Luxembourg
                    had perhaps 20 or 30 people. The one in London had over 500 people, to give you
                    some sense of scale. Nevertheless, under the old rules that prevailed within the
                    European Community, and now I'm speaking about the late 1980's, the country that
                    hosted the principal seat of a financial institution was responsible for
                    monitoring and supervising all of its activities. So technically Luxembourg was
                    responsible for monitoring and supervising the operations of that 500-person
                    branch office in London, as well as elsewhere in the world. Well, Luxembourg
                    couldn't do it and they asked the British authorities to help them. The British
                    were reluctant voluntarily to change the rule because they thought that it had
                    lots of implications for their relations with other countries and for the
                    burdens it would place on the British authorities. The formal British
                    responsibilities were less clear. I suppose that there was potentially room for
                    a counter suit or some legal defense against that kind of supervision.</p>
                <p>Since that time the financial authorities within the European Union have
                    addressed this issue. I believe that they now have agreed that when a bank has
                    branch offices that are very large the country that hosts such a large branch
                    will aid the country that houses the theoretical headquarters in supervising the
                    bank, if asked to do so. That agreement came too late to save us from the BCCI
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what the BCCI problem was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I don't remember all of the details. There were a number of illegal
                    transactions involving the bank. It had interests in several US banks. Somehow
                    the pyramid collapsed. Depositors lost huge sums of money, and some of the
                    shareholders lost large amounts of money. There were banks in metropolitan
                    Washington, DC, that were involved, as well as banks in the State of Georgia.
                    The whole thing started to fall apart when US banking authorities closed in on
                    what appeared to be strange transactions. That triggered the collapse of the
                    rest of the house of cards and brought people to Luxembourg to deal with the
                    issue.</p>
                <p>The question of compensating the depositors is still being considered in the
                    courts in various countries, including in Luxembourg. That's as much as I know
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you tell us what the term, money laundering, meant,
                        particularly in the context of the 1980's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>ROWELL: If somebody deposits money in a bank, and the money has come from a
                    criminal activity, the government has the right to impound the funds and may
                    even seize and confiscate them. The procedures for confiscating differ from
                    country to country and even from state to state in the United States. Money
                    laundering is the process by which money derived from criminal activity is moved
                    through the banking system to make it look as though it comes from legitimate
                    business. The aim is to make it easy to use the money in daily transactions
                    without attracting suspicion or investigation.</p>
                <p>Drug trafficking is clearly illegal, and money derived from it is subject to
                    confiscation.. Now, on the whole nobody pays much attention if you come into a
                    bank and deposit $500, a couple of thousand, or even $3,000. However, the large,
                    drug trafficking organizations handle tens of millions of dollars, even hundreds
                    of millions of dollars. Those are huge amounts of money to move, so they have to
                    find some way to make sure that the money cannot be traced to illegal activity.
                    To do that, they typically establish false front businesses that appear to be
                    legal — such as laundries, restaurants, transportation companies, commodities
                    dealers, almost anything. The false front businesses appear to pay large sums
                    for goods or services that in fact are never delivered. Those sums become
                    laundered money. Or the false front business will appear to have large receipts
                    for goods or services it never delivers. The apparent profit represents the
                    laundering of illegal funds. Then they pass the funds through a series of bank
                    accounts so that ultimately the money winds up in the account of somebody who
                    holds the funds for a drug cartel.</p>
                <p>Suppose, for example, a fictitious company which has nothing but a brass plate on
                    a door in a tenement building. It maintains two or three bank accounts in Miami.
                    The company deposits money in the bank accounts. It appears, say, to be in the
                    air cargo business. Then it appears to pay for the supplies or services it
                    receives. Perhaps aircraft maintenance, fuel, oil, and so forth. This will be
                    falsely invoiced by other store front companies, and then they go through a
                    money laundering process. The companies are not all in Miami. There will be
                    companies in New York and Chicago. Eventually, they will have a fictitious
                    relationship with some companies in Europe which have accounts in Luxembourg,
                    London, Paris, Frankfurt, or wherever. So the money goes through a whole series
                    of bank accounts. Of course, the longer the chain between the point of origin
                    and the ultimate bank account the harder it is to track.</p>
                <p>You have no idea of the enormous volume of the funds involved in regular
                    transactions that take place every single day. If you had a computer printout,
                    it might take more than the entire population of the United States to be able to
                    read every line of these transactions each day. That's the volume of the
                    transactions we are talking about. So how do you distinguish the bad ones from
                    the good ones which, in terms of the whole, represent an infinitesimal
                    proportion?</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>It's tough to do this. I guess that my point is that virtually all of the funds
                    that arrive in Luxembourg's international banks — not their domestic banks,
                    which are really very small in size — come by Electronic Financial Transfer
                    [EFT]. There is a steady flow of modest deposits physically carried into the
                    Luxembourg banks by persons from neighboring countries who typically are from
                    the professional classes, including doctors, dentists, lawyers, architects, and
                    civil engineers. They maintain personal accounts to avoid taxes in their
                    countries of residence. That's what's involved. But those accounts are easily
                    identifiable and have nothing to do with money laundering. Everything else comes
                    by an Electronic Financial Transfer. With the help of the Luxembourg
                    authorities, we were able to interdict some money laundering involving
                    Electronic Financial Transfers from US banks.</p>
                <p>I make that point because very often, in our frustration in getting very few
                    results from interdicting the financial resources of drug trafficking, we have
                    passed laws demanding that countries with which we deal force the banks to
                    report deposits above a certain level. The way the laws are written, it's clear
                    that the intent of Congress is to make sure that the bank reports CASH deposits
                    above some level, say when someone walks in with $5,000 or $10,000 in
                    cash—something like that. That's not the way that trafficking or money
                    laundering works. So the law is pointed at an irrelevant target. It complicates
                    things but it doesn't really do any good, the way it's written.</p>
                <p>When you try to interdict Electronic Financial Transactions, as I said, the
                    farther from the point of origin that you get, the harder it is to know the bona
                    fides of the persons involved in the transaction. What the Luxembourg bank has
                    to do, for example, is to go back to the bank, say, the First National Bank of
                    Chicago, and ask, “Can you certify the bona fides of this transfer?” Then the
                    Chicago bank has to go back to identify whoever transferred the money to it —
                    maybe a bank in Singapore. Or the chain goes back to a bank in San Francisco,
                    and then back to a bank in St. Louis. Eventually, the chain gets very fuzzy, and
                    nobody can swear absolutely that the funds involved were legally or illegally
                    derived. That's a big part of the problem. So that's money laundering.</p>
                <p>Let's talk a little bit about nuclear non proliferation, controlling the export
                    of certain goods. COCOM [The Coordinating Committee] was created during the Cold
                    War to prevent the export of valuable technology or goods to the Soviet Union or
                    Warsaw Pact countries. Then these controls were applied to some countries such
                    as Communist China and later, but with much more difficulty and in a much more
                    limited way, to some other countries with which the US had poor relations, such
                    as Iraq, Libya, and Iran. The purpose was to stop terrorism or to reduce the
                    risk that weapons of mass destruction could fall into the hands of unscrupulous
                    and conscienceless persons.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>During the Cold War the Soviet airline, Aeroflot, used Luxembourg as a principal
                    transit point to the Western Hemisphere and occasionally to Africa. It also
                    stopped in Lisbon, for the same purpose. Luxembourg was apparently chosen by
                    Aeroflot because it had no transoceanic international airline of its own, except
                    for an air cargo line, and it was easy to get to from any point in Western
                    Europe. It had long been a landing point for odd-ball airlines. The one best
                    known and beloved to Americans was Icelandic Airlines, the backpackers' airline
                    that allowed hundreds of thousands of American students to get to Europe for a
                    price that they could afford. The same thing that helped Icelandic Airlines, the
                    same lack of a national investment in a particular airline that made it easy for
                    Luxembourg to become the haven for NATO AWACS aircraft, also made it a transit
                    point for Aeroflot.</p>
                <p>From time to time the Russians attempted to pass through Luxembourg, often via
                    Aeroflot, certain goods that probably were on the COCOM list. I personally don't
                    have much in the way of details, as what we detected in this regard came from
                    intelligence sources which I can't talk about.</p>
                <p>The fundamental point is that there was probably always some trickle of goods
                    prohibited by COCOM. We paid a lot of attention to it and wanted to make sure
                    that nothing really significant was escaping through that hole. Again, we had
                    full cooperation from the Luxembourg authorities, but their ability to police,
                    monitor, and investigate was really very, very limited. So, from time to time we
                    would become active on that front in Luxembourg, whenever there was any
                    potential movement that might have been significant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any cases that came up during your time in
                        Luxembourg which you can talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I remember a couple of cases, though I don't remember their names. I
                    remember a shipment involving some computers, for example, and something else.
                    In each case the tendency of the Luxembourg authorities, when properly alerted
                    to a problem shipment, was to send it back to the point from which it had been
                    shipped to Luxembourg. So they never seized anything. Luxembourg was not a
                    manufacturer of these goods, in any case, so there was nothing coming from a
                    domestic Luxembourg company. It was always material in transit. By sending the
                    goods back to the point of origin, they made their point to the shipper. Beyond
                    that, I don't have a whole lot to say. My recollection is that Luxembourg didn't
                    play any sort of large role in COCOM, precisely because it didn't have any
                    manufacturers and basic producers of the goods in question. Luxembourg companies
                    were not major world traders in any of the commodities or goods involved in
                    COCOM controls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the banking side, did Luxembourg stand in any contrast
                        to Switzerland at the time, which was sort of the preeminent bankers'
                        state?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes, but not in terms of law enforcement. Well, I don't know how to make
                    the comparison in terms of law enforcement, because I never served in
                    Switzerland. I was in Luxembourg. So I can't do that.</p>
                <p>As far as being the tax haven that it is, Luxembourg, of course, is a member of
                    the European Communities, now the European Union. Switzerland is not.
                    Switzerland has an age-old reputation as a tax haven for persons from other
                    countries, off in other parts of the world — in the Western Hemisphere, Asia,
                    Africa, or wherever. Switzerland is notorious for producing only modest returns
                    on capital deposited in its banks. In some cases it has had a domestic tax of
                    one or two percentage points on the capital on deposit in its banks. This was
                    the case precisely because the Swiss knew that people were depositing these
                    funds to escape the authorities elsewhere, and these were very rich people.</p>
                <p>Yes, there are some rich people who are depositors in Luxembourg. But if you just
                    look at numbers, probably the largest share of depositors there are professional
                    people who are citizens of neighboring countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose deposits would be modest, say, compared with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: That's right. And the rates of return paid by Luxembourg financial
                    institutions have typically involved low, real rates of return. They are
                    significant, not outrageously high the way you sometimes get in the Cayman
                    Islands or the Channel Islands, where people understand that you run the risk of
                    associating with a fly-by-night institution. So you get a premium on the return
                    on the money you risk. There aren't any fly-by-night banks in Luxembourg that I
                    know of. It's to the interest of Luxembourg to make sure that such institutions
                    stay out of the country. However, the Luxembourg financial institutions do pay a
                    serious rate of interest which compares favorably with the rates paid in
                    Germany, France, the Netherlands, Britain, and other countries like that.
                    Whether Luxembourg rates are as favorable as rates paid in the US really depends
                    on the way you want to bet on the movement of the US dollar in terms of European
                    currencies. That is, the exchange rate parity, as well as how you want to bet on
                    forthcoming actions of the Federal Reserve Bank compared to forthcoming actions
                    of, say, the Bundesbank, the German central bank. That is a different set of
                    gambles. Sometimes, the return on long term deposits in Luxembourg has been
                    better than in the US and sometimes it has been not quite as good. If you're a
                    European, you probably tend to keep your money in Europe. If you're an American,
                    you probably tend to keep your money in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>Other bilateral issues. The Luxembourg cargo airline has long wanted a long-term
                    license to operate certain regular routes to the US. The US Department of
                    Transportation has regularly granted them a temporary license, renewable on a
                    year-to-year basis. The fundamental reason is that no US airline had had any
                    particular interest in scheduled flying to Luxembourg. The US Department of
                    Transportation doesn't give away licenses to foreign airlines unless it can get
                    a quid pro quo that is valuable to a US carrier. So that remains a permanent
                    problem in terms of our bilateral relationship.</p>
                <p>There are occasional investor problems where a US investor has put money into a
                    company registered in Luxembourg. There may be complaints about whether the
                    investor is being treated fairly or not. I don't recall any reverse cases, with
                    Luxembourg investors feeling unhappy with what happened to money that they'd
                    invested in the US. However, I think that you could count on the fingers of one
                    hand the number of problems in this respect that arose during my four and
                    one-half years in Luxembourg — although one of them was quite large. So that's
                    how that went. Now, what else did we have on our agenda?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't think of anything else. You certainly talked about
                        the NATO and UN role. Perhaps it's time to talk about your retirement. When
                        did you leave Luxembourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: I retired at the end of August, 1994. I left Luxembourg at the beginning
                    of August, 1994, after being there as Ambassador for four years and four
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've had a number of posts in the Foreign Service. I
                        think we discussed this at one time. Do you have some reflections on the
                        work of the Central Intelligence Agency, the control exercised and
                        relationship of the chief of mission with the CIA Station in his Embassy?
                        Would you like to talk a little about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: Yes. In fact, I'd like to talk about the control exercised by the chief
                    of mission in relation to all of the agencies that might be represented at a
                    post.</p>
                <p>In my experience a chief of mission has no problem maintaining direction and
                    overall control in a mission, despite the variety of different agencies that may
                    be represented. The truth is that Americans posted overseas by and large need a
                    community of friends with whom they can live comfortably. The chief of mission
                    controls the resident official American community to a substantial extent. All
                    that a chief of mission has to do is to make sure that his mission is reaching
                    out to all of the attach�s and other people from different US Government
                    agencies, properly respecting them and making the best use of their work. He
                    finds a very responsive cadre.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>Military personnel, particularly those in a Military Assistance Advisory Group,
                    are uniformly responsive to a chief of mission. The military institution is
                    structured on hierarchy. You salute people who have higher authority and
                    responsibility. When military people are assigned to an Embassy, they understand
                    that the Ambassador is in charge. There really isn't a problem. When,
                    occasionally, difficulties come up, normally they can be resolved well enough.
                    The Military Assistance Advisory Group, for example, reports to the nearest
                    Theater Commander. Well, the Theater Commander doesn't want to put his colonel
                    at a particular Embassy in an impossible situation vis-a-vis the Ambassador.
                    This really can't help the military advisory operation, can't help the Theater
                    Commander, and can't help the colonel. So when the Ambassador goes to the
                    colonel and says, “Look, I have a problem with this issue. We need to fix it. It
                    needs to be changed in some way, I can't approve it.” Or, he may say, “I wish
                    that you would look after this.” The colonel goes back through his chain of
                    command and says, “How do we deal with this?” They always find some way to deal
                    with the problem.</p>
                <p>Similarly, military attach�s know whom they're supposed to salute, although the
                    service divisions within the attach� group at a diplomatic mission may make it a
                    little harder to impose discipline. In fact, one of the unfortunate things that
                    I had to do during my tenure as Ambassador in Lisbon was to require the early
                    departure of a service attach�. This caused me no problems with the other
                    service attach�s, nor with that attach�'s successor.</p>
                <p>AID is the same thing. In fact, AID doesn't have a program in a country unless
                    the Ambassador approves the program. Any Ambassador has the right to look at the
                    program in whatever detail he or she may wish and to suggest changes or
                    modifications, set additional criteria, or whatever they want. Normally, to the
                    extent that the Ambassador pays real attention to the AID operation, the AID
                    people are pleased, delighted, and elated because too often they feel ignored
                    and unappreciated by the State Department components of an Embassy. My only
                    gripe with the AID operation is that they still call themselves by early Cold
                    War, post World War II titles, like Mission Director, as though they are somehow
                    separate from an Embassy. They're not. The Americans assigned to the AID Mission
                    are part of the Embassy. The Mission, as they call it in AID, is a part of the
                    Embassy. They may not think so in AID/Washington, but every Ambassador thinks so
                    and makes it happen that way. So, again, that's not a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>Where we tend to get problems is sometimes with the law enforcement agencies,
                    domestic agencies such as the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], DEA [Drug
                    Enforcement Administration] or Secret Service. Sometimes they will send overseas
                    an agent who has had a number of domestic assignments, sometimes a distinguished
                    law enforcement career, but who hasn't had any overseas experience and doesn't
                    have a clue how the different parts of an Embassy have to work together or how
                    to interface with host authorities most effectively. Such agents sometimes
                    arrive overseas still operating as a subcompartment of a barony within another
                    cabinet department of the United States Government. They tend to regard
                    everybody who is not part of their particular micro institution as somebody to
                    be polite to, but not necessarily to salute in a serious way. Getting a handle
                    on that is a little bit trickier. But, again, you're dealing with people who are
                    operating in one- and two-person offices in a situation where in a variety of
                    very human ways they need the support of the larger Embassy complement.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Ambassador always has the ultimate weapon of saying, “I won't
                    accept this particular person” or, “I won't accept this position.” Or, “This
                    person has caused me too many problems. Get rid of him or her.” Ambassadors can
                    use that weapon too often, but if they apply it once in a while, it has a
                    salutary effect.</p>
                <p>Problems come up over and over again in the NSDD-38 system [National Security
                    Decision Document No. 38] which was approved several administrations ago.
                    NSDD-38 says that whenever an agency of the US Government wishes to position one
                    of its people at an Embassy or in a foreign country, the position cannot be
                    established for residence in that country and a person may not be assigned to
                    that country without the consent of the US chief of mission. From time to time
                    chiefs of mission may say, “No, this assignment is a bad idea.” Every time they
                    do that, in my experience, they have failed to receive the necessary support
                    from the Department of State or the NSC staff. Eventually, something tends to be
                    forced down their throat. But that's a Washington question.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, Ambassadors don't resist, partly because they feel that they need more
                    resources and they can't get them from the foreign affairs agencies [e.g., the
                    Department of State]. So they take resources from wherever they can get them.
                    Sometimes they don't resist because they figure that in a serious case
                    Washington will not back them up. Then there are other Ambassadors who resist
                    whenever they think that it is proper, and they don't care how the ultimate
                    decision goes.</p>

                <p>Obviously, I haven't talked yet about the CIA. In my experience their Chiefs of
                    Station [COS] mostly fulfill their responsibilities to keep the Ambassador
                    informed of what they are doing in the country of assignment. They also fulfill
                    their responsibilities — sometimes after a great deal of friction and effort not
                    of their making — to provide overall supervision for all US intelligence
                    gathering in the area. For example, they are responsible for any aspect of the
                    activities of Legal Attach�s [FBI representatives] not specifically related to
                    law enforcement cases. They are responsible for anything done by any element of
                    a US intelligence agency, uniformed or civilian. So typically an Ambassador
                    relies very heavily on that Chief of Station to perform that function, because
                    it's not a function that the Ambassador or the DCM should perform directly.</p>
                <p>On a couple of occasions I have run into a couple of really incompetent people.
                    In one case the incompetence was so gross that the individual was failing to
                    perform his official responsibilities to me out of fear that I might leak what
                    he should have told me. He was unable to form valid judgments. He left the post
                    on regular rotation before I could ask for his recall. That was the worst case
                    and, curiously, it was in the smallest operation that I ever had where it didn't
                    amount to a hill of beans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes, I think that those persons assigning people in
                        Washington do not fully appreciate what the consequences of their actions
                        may be. I know that I've been in assignment positions where we tended to
                        take care of our not-so-competent people by sending them to huge posts where
                        we felt that they would be swallowed up. Sometimes, there was a cumulative
                        effect from making several, such assignments. At one time, when I was in
                        charge of consular assignments, I think that the Embassy in London had far
                        too many people who really were on their last legs in career terms. Or else,
                        we might arrange to have such people shipped out to small posts, in the
                        view, “How can they screw up anything in Luxembourg?” Fairly or unfairly,
                        this is what is sometimes thought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: You're absolutely right. That's true in virtually every agency that
                    exists. You either bury persons of low capacity in a very big place or in a
                    place where, no matter how awful a screw up, it can't hurt us too badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the perception is that it can't hurt us.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>ROWELL: Well, you never know until it happens. I think that's why such
                    assignments are made. When a particular CIA station is facilitating something
                    that transcends the boundaries of an Ambassador's responsibility, the rule about
                    what the station has to tell the Ambassador is rather unclear. This is a
                    situation which happens very often. Somebody is passing through a given place.
                    Say, a meeting is going to be held, following which the participants will go off
                    to where they live, which is not in the area of the Ambassador's responsibility.
                    Technically, they are not conducting any operations on anything related to the
                    Ambassador's responsibilities. However, the Station Chiefs I have known have
                    kept me informed on those things just in case an accident or something else were
                    to bring one of the visitors into the public domain. Sometimes I have not been
                    informed, especially if things are happening on very short notice. The Station
                    Chiefs really watched out for anything which, if discovered, could potentially
                    embarrass us or create some collateral problem that I would have to take
                    cognizance of. I never had any such embarrassment.</p>
                <p>This was true even of a couple of Station Chiefs who were just good, medium
                    quality sloggers. They consistently produced good work but were far from
                    brilliant. They told me what they should have told me, and it was fine. We never
                    had any trouble distinguishing between how much I needed to know and operational
                    details I didn't have to know, except in the one case that I mentioned where one
                    person was way out of his depth. I must say that it wasn't simply a lack of
                    knowledge on my part of what he was doing. It was clear to me when I went back
                    to his supervisors, that part of the problem was that he wasn't doing anything.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>There is one more question. The intrinsic question is, “Should an Ambassador be
                    kept informed?” Aren't there times, for example, when it would be better if an
                    Ambassador isn't told, because then, if something goes wrong, the Ambassador can
                    cite unawareness and non-culpability. My answer is, “Absolutely no.” The
                    Ambassador must be informed. When something goes wrong in the country of
                    assignment, it doesn't make any difference whether the Ambassador approved,
                    disapproved, knew, or was ignorant about it. It doesn't make any difference at
                    all. The Ambassador is responsible. He or she still has to explain and to make
                    amends. He or she has to do both, not just in the country of assignment, but in
                    a possible report to the Congress of the United States, and other agencies. The
                    chief of mission cannot escape having to explain. If the explanation is, “My
                    staff didn't tell me,” the answer is, “You were an incompetent leader or an
                    incompetent Ambassador, if your staff was able to keep secrets from you that
                    could cause that much trouble.” There is no excuse. On two or three occasions I
                    had a DCM come to me and say, “I don't think that you really want to know the
                    details on this.” I just gave the same lecture to the DCM. I said, “Don't ever
                    think of making a decision on a subject like that without telling me as much as
                    I need to know, making sure that I'm given that opportunity to decide before you
                    do it.” The DCM's learned very quickly how to handle such cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>ROWELL: God knows. No doubt, when I read the transcript...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can always add something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROWELL: One last thing. This has to do with the money laundering question. When I
                    had my hearings for confirmation before going to Luxembourg as Ambassador, money
                    laundering was very much on the minds of the Senators. They asked if I would do
                    something about money laundering in Luxembourg. I told them that my number one
                    responsibility in Bolivia had been to try to stop drug trafficking. I had been
                    deeply engaged in that and was totally committed to it. I said that I had lost
                    none of my commitment during my stay in Portugal. I said that I would certainly
                    continue to pursue it in Luxembourg.</p>
                <p>So, in a sense, when I arrived in Luxembourg, I had an instruction from the
                    Senate to be very tough on money laundering and to do everything I could to make
                    sure that we were interdicting it. I kept my word.</p>
