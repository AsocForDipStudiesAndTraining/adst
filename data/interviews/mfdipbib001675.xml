                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, let me express our appreciation to you for giving us
                        time to add to our collection what I believe will be a very valuable
                        contribution. Let me start with some questions about your beginnings. When
                        and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I was born in 1933 in Lakewood, New Jersey. I was the last of seven
                    children. The oldest, 20 was already a junior in college.</p>
                <p>Both my father and mother immigrated to the U.S. from Lithuania - Russia in those
                    days. They had come from a small Jewish village.</p>
                <p>My father was a ritual slaughtereone who was qualified to slaughter animals
                    according to Orthodox Jewish practices. My mother was a home maker. Neither of
                    my parents spoke English when they landed in the U.S. in 1915. They both learned
                    imy father much better than my mother. She understood English, but she never
                    really learned how to speak it well. We spoke Yiddish at the house, although all
                    the children who were still at home when I became old enough to talk, spoke
                    English. I spoke to my father in English and in Yiddish to my mother.</p>
                <p>I went to school in Lakewood - elementary through high school. Lakewood, at the
                    time, was a small town of more than 4,000 inhabitants. It had a sizeable Jewish
                    population, mostly orthodox.</p>
                <p>All my brothers have died from heart attacks as did my father. One of my sisters
                    is still living although she suffers from Alzheimer's, which my mother also had.
                    So both heart disease and Alzheimer runs in the family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any particular subject that caught your
                        attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Baseball was my first passion starting in third grade. I knew all the
                    statistics. I did become interested in foreign affairs quite early the first
                    year of high school probably. I had the usual subject - history, geography, etc.
                    which all increased my interest in foreign affairs. The second war certainly
                    added to it. I remember becoming quite interested in events in Czechoslovakia,
                    particularly when Jan Masaryk was thrown out of the window of his office in 1948
                    at the beginning of the Communist take over. That night in particular grabbed
                    me.</p>
                <p>I studied a good deal of history in the 11th and 12th grades. I am not completely
                    sure how my interest in foreign affairs developed, but it did. I followed
                    contemporary affairs; and read many newspapers and magazines. I started with the
                    sports pages, and went on to the front pages and more substantive matters. I
                    think for a kid I was well acquainted with world affairs.</p>
                <p>We had some heavy debates among my friends who followed current events. Some of
                    them were very informed, which made for lively discussions. My family was also
                    interested in what was going on, particularly in Europe. All of my siblings were
                    well educated. My parents spent almost all their money on the education of their
                    children. It paid off for my brothers. They all became successful in their
                    careers and made plenty of money. I was the exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Lakewood High School in 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Right. Graduation day was about a week before the North Korean tanks
                    crossed the border into South Korea.</p>
                <p>I knew that I would go to college and major in history or political science. I
                    don't think that international relations was then recognized a separate major,
                    but I certainly intended to focus on that area.</p>
                <p>I applied to a number of colleges - Yale, Tufts and Stanford. I was not accepted
                    by Yale, but Stanford offered me a full scholarship, which paid for almost all
                    of my college expenses. That was very important because I needed all the
                    financial help I could get. I had never seen Stanford, but it had a sort of
                    romantic appeal. My brother-in-law got his PhD in Physics from Stanford and he
                    was very enthusiastic about the school. I had never visited the campus, but for
                    some reason, Stanford seemed to be the right place for me besides the financial
                    inducements. I thought it was the right time to get away from home although I
                    admit that sitting in Lakewood, NJ, Stanford felt as far away as an American
                    university could be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find when you arrived at Stanford?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I am afraid that I did use my undergraduate years very well. I was a
                    “nerd” I studied all the time. I doubled up on courses. That allowed me to
                    graduate in three years, but I did miss a lot campus life by being so
                    book-bound. I spent little time on parties, even though at the time, Stanford
                    was know as a “a party school”. I made up for this neglect when I went to
                    graduate school where I spent a lot of time away from books. So you can see, I
                    did things backward. I should have partied more as an undergraduate and been
                    more serious in graduate school.</p>
                <p>I majored in history and economics at Stanford. I really liked most of my
                    professors. I was particularly fond of H. Steward Hughes, the son of Charles
                    Evans Hughes. He taught courses on European history, with an emphasis on
                    European intellectual history. Later he taught at Harvard, he became a very
                    liberal Democrat, and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Massachusetts. I took
                    two independent reading courses from Hughes in political philosophy and theory.
                    Those were probably my most stimulating courses at Stanford thanks in great part
                    to Hughes - a great intellectual and a very gracious man.</p>
                <p>At Stanford, I started taking courses in Chinese. They were mostly a waste of
                    time because Chinese is not something one picks up just by taking a college
                    course here and there of three hours a week. It requires full immersion. If I
                    were learning Chinese again, I would have gone directly to Taiwan - we could not
                    go to China - to spend a year or more studying Chinese and completely immersed
                    in a Chinese culture and life-style. Learning Chinese at Stanford and later at
                    Harvard -in retrospect, was a poor use of time with little return.</p>
                <p>By my sophomore year at Stanford, I had decided that the U.S. was not paying
                    enough attention to China. There was, of course, considerable debate about such
                    political issues as “who lost China”, but that was hardly a fundamental question
                    on China's future. I thought that we were not paying sufficient attention to
                    that future, even though it was clear that this huge country was likely to
                    become a major player in the world. I thought that China would require major
                    attention and would eventually loom large in world affairs. But it was still a
                    subject that had barely been touched in academia. I didn't start with much
                    interest in the rest of East Asia, but as I progressed in my academic studies, I
                    became increasingly convinced that the whole area would be of increasing
                    importance to the U.S. and a good focus in career terms. These academic
                    interests fit well with my increasing interest in joining the Foreign Service.
                    My professors were more interested in my attending graduate school, and they all
                    urged me to follow my pursuits of China. Regrettably, I was not a good language
                    student; I never could speak Chinese well, but I did become quite comfortable
                    reading Chinese.</p>
                <p>I took more and more courses on East Asia and although my major was still
                    history, my emphasis was unmistakably the Far East as it was the known. I took a
                    lot of courses from Professor Arthur Wright who was a distinguished historian of
                    China and a real source of encouragement. Mrs. Wright was the curator of the
                    Chinese collection at the Hoover Institute. Both urged me to attend Harvard
                    after my undergraduate days at Stanford.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished undergraduate school in three years. What
                        degree did you earn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I got a BA in history and economics. A large portion of my course
                    work was on East Asia, but I also took courses in European history, American
                    history, economics and philosophy. I was certainly not an academic economist.
                    The theoretical aspects just didn't really interest me and probably escaped me.
                    I was interested in institutional economics - business, labor - the history of
                    economic development. I took a number of courses in those areas - the minimum in
                    theory - enough to qualify me for a degree in economics as well as history.</p>
                <p>As I said, at the urging of some professors, I went to graduate school. I would
                    have gone even without the urgings because Harvard, at the time, was becoming
                    the center for Chinese studies in the U.S. John Fairbanks was, of course, the
                    leading light in that development. He built up a center at Harvard which also
                    offered for the first time a degree (MA) in regional studies.</p>
                <p>At this time, the Ford Foundation had become very interested in East Asia
                    studies. McGeorge Bundy was developing programs for the study of the USSR and
                    China. So I got a fellowship from Ford to pursue my studies; I think it was a
                    generous $2,500 which pretty much covered my graduate school expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At either Stanford or Harvard did you meet any members of
                        the Foreign Service which might have stimulated your interest in the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I do remember one senior Foreign Service officer who came to Harvard
                    to get graduate students interested in the Foreign Service. I don't remember
                    what he said, but I was impressed both by the officer and his presentation.
                    There were about twenty of us at that lecture. I was in my first year at Harvard
                    and still debating whether I should pursue a PhD or go to work after receiving
                    my Master's. In any case, some graduate work was good preparation for the
                    Foreign Service, which, as I said earlier, was always my first career choice. I
                    don't know precisely when I reached that conclusion, but it followed logically
                    from my interests in world affairs. It was a very active period in world
                    affairlots of exciting things were happening. It was a choice that I made
                    without much input or influence from outside forcee.g., faculty, Foreign Service
                    officers, family, etc. Indeed, some of my family thought I was crazy.</p>
                <p>My time at Harvard also led me to the conclusion that a life of an academic was
                    simply not for me nor did I feel particularly talented for it. I completed my
                    course work, chose my thesis topic - China's first modern bank - which I found
                    so boring that eventually I lost interest and never completed my dissertation. I
                    took the general exam for the PhD, passed it, but never wrote the thesis.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I spent three years at Harvard. My major decisions while there, as I said
                    earlier, were to confirm that the academy was not for me, even in Chinese
                    studies and that I did want to join the U.S. government, specifically the
                    Foreign Service. At that timvery different from today - entering government
                    service was viewed positively - by your peers, and society. That has not been
                    the situation for a decade or more, I am sorry to say. The Foreign Service had a
                    great intellectual attraction as well a real sense of purpose and of service.
                    The Cold War was still in its early stages and that surely had an effect on the
                    country's view of the Foreign Service. I am not sure I could make the same claim
                    today.</p>
                <p>My professors, although expressing their interest in pursuing an academic career,
                    were certainly supportive of my F.S. interests. We used to have a weekly
                    afternoon social discussing contemporary affairs at John Fairbank's house.
                    Sometimes Teddy White would be there; sometimes John Stewart Service would be
                    there. The McCarthy “hunts” were in the headlines at the time, and the 1954
                    hearings deeply engaged everyone. Conversation at the Fairbanks would always be
                    lively and stimulating. Despite the beating the State Department was taking, and
                    particularly the loss of the “China hands”, my interest in the Foreign Service
                    did not wane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take the Foreign Service exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: In 1957, in Washington, DC. I passed it. Marshall Brement, who also
                    entered the Foreign Service, was sitting next to me. I took it in Washington
                    because that is where I was at the time. I passed the oral in 1958. After
                    leaving Harvard, and having no job, I took a management intern appointment at
                    the Labor Department. I knew when I accepted that position that I would not stay
                    at Labor very long, but I needed the income. This appointment also required
                    passing an exam - the junior management intern exam - which allowed various
                    departments to offer special jobs to those who had passed. It was the
                    sought-after way into the government for recent college graduates. I took
                    Labor's offer for a position in its international affairs division. An
                    additional complication was the fact that I knew that I would be called soon for
                    military duty.</p>
                <p>Just as I was about to be drafted, the government opened a new program which
                    allowed people to serve in the active forces for six months and then in a
                    reserve status for seven years. I had been accepted for naval officer training
                    at Newport, although I must say that I had a hard time imagining myself in that
                    role. Then this new program opened, I opted for it, a week before I was to
                    report to Newport. I left Labor after six months and joined the Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I was first assigned to Fort Dix for two months of basic training and then to
                    Fort Chaffe in Arkansas for six months as a clerk-typist, during which time I
                    managed to catch pneumonia. I still don't understand how I managed to last that
                    long, much less being nominated as “soldier of the month” at Fort Chaffee. My
                    friends and I chuckled at this. I was still a clerk-typist when I joined the
                    Reserves. (Ironically, when I took a Presidential appointmenas a FSO - I was
                    automatically discharged from the Reserves. So I was on active duty for six
                    months and in the Reserves for eighteen months.</p>
                <p>When I was discharged from active duty, a position in ICA (AID's predecessor)
                    opened up and I took it. I also took the oral exams for the Foreign Service in
                    1958, but State stopped hiring new FSOs in that year. I did not get appointed as
                    a Foreign Service officer for two years, I spent one year at ICA's headquarters
                    in Washington in 1958 and then one year with the ICA mission in Taiwan in 1958
                    as an assistant program officer. In 1960, I was finally appointed an FSO and
                    moved across the street, so to speak, from the ICA mission to the embassy.</p>
                <p>In ICA I started in the Office of Chinese Affairs - i.e., working on Taiwan. I
                    stayed in Washington for one year, participating also in a training program.
                    Most of my time was spent working on the “desk.” I learned a good bit about the
                    operations of the Washington foreign affairs bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>My boss at ICA was a wonderful woman, Laura Hughes, who taught me a lot about
                    operating in the USG. She devoted considerable amount of time to my training and
                    development - she even asked for my views on occasions. It was a small office -
                    only three of us. I was really an add-on to the regular staff; that is there was
                    no formal position for me.</p>
                <p>In ICA Taiwan, I became responsible for the management of the commodity import
                    program, which was a large part of our assistance effort to that country. I
                    analyzed Taiwan's needs, proposed which commodities to finance, and worked with
                    the Taiwan government to make sure all came to pass. I also prepared that
                    portion of the mission's annual AID request.</p>
                <p>The Taiwan program was a large one. We must have had about 1.000 employees in ICA
                    headed by Wes Haraldson an FSO and a very good and determined AID director.</p>
                <p>I liked the Taiwan assignment, one I had prepared for. It was sort of the
                    “Promised Land.” I was finally in a Chinese environment, learning the language
                    and culture and traveling around the island. I had the opportunity to put my
                    academic training to use, which was not always relevant. I met with many Chinese
                    officials, learned a lot about doing business with bureaucracies in Taiwan and
                    the U.S. It was my first overseas experience. Many of Taiwan's officials of
                    course were refugees from the mainland; in fact, they made Taiwan the economic
                    success it became. They were outstanding technocrats and their consistent
                    contributions provided the essential spark to Taiwan's economic success
                    story.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>The principal aim of the assistance program was to reduce the rate of inflation.
                    It was a real economic challenge. The economy had been running out of control
                    because of huge defense expenditures. This was the main justification for the
                    commodity import program; i.e., importing goods at low prices would drive down
                    the price of all commodities, thereby dampening inflation. The commodities
                    covered the whole range of economic activity, but especially agricultural
                    products. In addition ICA helped develop and finance Taiwan's new infrastructure
                    and expanded farm production. On the whole, our assistance program was well
                    thought out, executed with skill, and instrumental in starting Taiwan on its way
                    to become one of East Asia's “tigers” like South Korea and Singapore. The
                    Taiwanese economy far outpaced economic development efforts in most
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You seem to credit the Taiwanese officials for much of the
                        economic success.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Absolutely. The top ones were honest, smart, and dedicated to making
                    things happen. Most, but not all, came from the mainland. One of the principal
                    institutions involved in this economic development process was the JCRR (The
                    Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction). That was run by a very prominent
                    Chinese intellectual, but was a joint U.S-Taiwan organization which managed a
                    nation wide agricultural development program which turned out to be very
                    successful and often held up as a model for other countries. It was actually
                    started on the mainland but fell a foul of the Chinese civil war.</p>
                <p>I am not suggesting that economic development by itself produced political
                    growth. When I was there Taiwan was a very authoritative country run by the KMT
                    (Kuomintang). There was a huge divide between the native Taiwanese and the
                    “mainlanders” who followed Chiang Kai-shek from the mainland after the Communist
                    take-over in 1949. That divide still remains but has been significantly reduced
                    by Taiwan's overall development and the very significant rise in incomes of the
                    whole population.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Taiwan after a terrible incident in 1957 when a number of Taiwanese
                    were killed by the Nationalist forces. Chiang Kai-shek ran the country from the
                    day he landed until 1975 when he died. The military which had followed him from
                    the mainland were his enforcement mechanism. On the other hand, the economy grew
                    and grew. The U.S. tried to encourage more democratic approaches to political
                    development on the island but not very aggressively. We treaded carefully in the
                    political landscape. As Embassy officials we were instructed to be careful with
                    whom we talked publicly. Some of our contacts had to be “out of sight.” We could
                    not be viewed as encouraging a Taiwanese political identity. Such activity was
                    frowned upon by the Nationalists and by our own ambassador, Everett Drumright.
                    In my perhaps unfair view he had a strong case of “clientitis.” It was not
                    simply a matter of caution. I think he felt the nationalists would one day
                    return to the mainland.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The ICA-Embassy relationship was very good, conducted mostly at higher levels
                    than mine. We far outnumbered the Embassy and our building was much larger. The
                    embassy Political Section had four or five officers. Same for the Economic
                    Section. Perhaps more importantly, ICA had the resources to dole out which made
                    us key players for the government. The Embassy, of course, had an important role
                    in the AID program; it had to approve the level and composition of the
                    assistance program and at times requested changes. I don't remember much
                    friction between the two organizations; they seemed to work cooperatively and
                    present a united front to the KMT government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the social life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: We were young and just married and all was interesting. Sheppie and I
                    were engaged before I left the States. Sheppie, however, didn't join me until
                    after our marriage. Three months after I arrived in Taiwan, our embassy in Burma
                    requested that an economic officer be sent to Rangoon to conduct an economic
                    survey of the country. I was asked whether I would be interested in this
                    assignment. I said sure and took off to Burma in the summer of 1959. I stayed
                    for three months and worked up the annual country economic report for Burma
                    which was required as a justification for an assistance program.</p>
                <p>I essentially made up most of the economic data as best I could; much was just
                    not available in Burma, as it was not in many underdeveloped countries. I
                    covered about ten years both retroactively and prospectively. I developed GNP
                    figures and the supporting data. It took me about two months to complete this
                    report and then I was given permission to travel around the country. That was
                    enormously interesting, but not entirely a happy experience. On returning from
                    Mandalay on a train I got quite sick with a terrible toothache. I got to the
                    Strand Hotel which was a marvelous relic left over from the days of the British.
                    By sheer luck, the manager of the hotel was a Stanford graduate. In fact, one
                    summer he and I had driven across the States from Stanford to the East Coast.
                    Small world!!! I don't know which of us was more surprised when we met. I called
                    him at 2:00 in the morning and told him I was in very bad shape and needed help.
                    He immediately got me in touch with a friend of his - a practicing physician at
                    the local university hospital. He took me to that hospital at 3:00 a.m. where I
                    was examined. I had an abscess in one tooth. He prescribed a pain killer and
                    told me to see a dentist as soon as possible. My friend recommended a dentist
                    who gave me some more drugs and told me to seen an oral surgeon as soon as I
                    returned. A few days before this incident, Sheppie and I had decided to get
                    married; so I returned not to Taiwan but to the U.S. We got married in September
                    1959 while I was undergoing drug treatment. As a matter of fact, the day after
                    our marriage, I went to see the dentist. That was the beginning of a long and
                    continuing marriage. Eventually, I lost that tooth but only after all the drama.
                    Fidel Castro was in town that day and we went to Lafayette Park to hear him.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I returned to Taiwan soon after the wedding and was joined by Sheppie. We spent a
                    lot of time with our American and Taiwanese colleagues and a number of Chinese
                    friends. There were a number of American academics working in Taipei with whom
                    we became friendly. Through them, we met a lot of Chinese scholars. We traveled
                    extensively throughout the island. So we learned a lot and made many Chinese
                    friends. Although this was the first time in the Far East for both of us, we did
                    not find it difficult to adjust to a different society and culture. We had a
                    good time.</p>
                <p>When I went to Taichung for language training, I wrote my first public article.
                    It was on the Taiwan economy and its progress. Although I had it cleared by the
                    Department, I used a fictitious name, Sheppard Glass, which was Sheppie's maiden
                    name. It was published in a new Journal - The China Quarterly - and was well
                    received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you decide to move to the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: As I mentioned, I waited for two years to get my security clearance
                    and more importantly, for State to find the funds to hire me. I kept getting
                    letters from the Department telling me that I was still very much on their
                    minds, but that they wouldn't be able to hire me in 1959. Finally, in 1960, I
                    got a letter that the Department was ready to embrace me and that I could join
                    the A-100 course (the introductory course offered to incoming officers) when I
                    returned to Washington. I was appointed as an FSO-7 rather than FSO-8. I was
                    given credit for my previous employment as well as my graduate school work.</p>
                <p>I was sworn in as a new Foreign Service Officer in Taipei and assigned to the
                    consular section of the Embassy. It was supposedly part of a rotational training
                    program, starting with consular work and then being assigned to other sections
                    of the embassy.</p>
                <p>Many new officers, including myself, viewed an assignment to the consular section
                    with some skepticism. In fact, I found that time in the consular section to be
                    of enormous help. For one, I wrote a number of messages to Washington on our
                    concerns regarding visa problems we were encountering in Taiwan. At the time,
                    these messages received considerable attention; I don't know if they would
                    today.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>My second fortuitous circumstance came because my boss knew how to write and
                    taught me what he knew. He was a very smart Foreign Service officer, but not an
                    ambitious one. He really didn't care much about his career; he just wanted to
                    reach retirement age having enjoyed what he had done regardless whether he had
                    accomplished much or won any recognition. He had been a political officer but
                    somewhere along the line had drifted into the consular business. His name was
                    Tom Dehart and he had been the head of the embassy's consular section for a few
                    years. We became friends and he really helped me immensely to sharpen my writing
                    - systematic organization, clarity of thought, etc. I think his talent was
                    wasted, but he preferred a sort of easier life. I have always owed him a real
                    debt for his tutoring.</p>
                <p>The consular section was a very busy one due primarily to some very serious visa
                    fraud problems. Chinese students would get a short-term student visa and never
                    return to the island. I must say that I had great sympathy for them - jobs in
                    Taiwan were hard to come by then. Nevertheless they were clearly in violation of
                    U.S. law. I was a very lenient visa officer! I must say that no one complained
                    about my actions or attitude. Whether others were in sympathy with my views or
                    whether there was little oversight, I don't know, probably both. In any case, my
                    generosity seemed to be acceptable. I never violated U.S. laws, but where I had
                    some leeway, I was lenient.</p>
                <p>It was not my visa issuance work that attracted the embassy's attention, but
                    rather my writings in that section. I focused on broader policy issues which
                    individual or groups of visa applications raised. For example, one dispatch was
                    on the pervasive problem of visa fraud in Taiwan. A lot of people on that island
                    made money from the visa issuance process. It was these think pieces, plus my
                    background in economics, which eventually led to my early reassignment to the
                    economic section. That had been part of the original rotation plan which allowed
                    me to use my economic background.</p>
                <p>Of course, at the time, even though the economy was obviously beginning to grow,
                    the “grass seemed greener” on the other side of the fence. Now of course, the
                    trend seems to have been reversed. Many, probably most, U.S. trained Chinese
                    return to Taiwan to seek their fortune.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in the economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I had a good time. I talked to all sorts of people, high and low. I
                    didn't talk to the president or his son, but I talked to many senior government
                    officials. I had a pretty free hand in selecting subjects I wanted to focus on.
                    I covered financial issues - one of the major disputes between Washington and
                    the embassy concerned inflation. Louis Marks was the Department's expert on the
                    subject - a very smart guy. He was convinced that Taiwan had licked inflation
                    and he was right. Many in Taiwan and the U.S. did not agree with that analysis.
                    I wrote a number of pieces on the subject, one, I remember, when the Taiwanese
                    introduced a 100 Taiwan dollar bill the previous highest note was 10 Taiwan
                    dollars. That was an indicator used by many to show that inflation was really
                    creeping in; it was not the case.</p>
                <p>My boss was Paul Storm an very interesting and unusual fellow. He pretty much
                    left me to my own devices and I picked what I thought was important. There were
                    some mandatory reports, such as the weekly economic report, to which we all had
                    to contribute. We also in those days had something called CERP (Comprehensive
                    Economic Reporting Program) was required periodically with listed reports. But
                    in general, I was pretty much able to pursue economic issues which were timely
                    and of real interest to me. There were four officers in the section. Two of us
                    were junior officers, Herb Horowitz and me. We divided up the reporting.</p>
                <p>Taiwan was a very interesting economic post and had enormous activity and
                    dynamism. The place was changing into a modern economy. You could see the change
                    right in front of your eyes. You didn't have to watch the grass grow; it
                    boomed.</p>
                <p>The political progress, to the extent that it existed, was not noticeable from
                    the outside. The KMT and the President ran the place. But improvement in
                    education and a growing economy was creating intellectual and psychological
                    change in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>For me good governance, dedicated people, and free-market oriented policies were
                    the driving sources of the expanding economy. I would particularly give credit
                    for this phenomenon to the effective and determined governance. It turned out to
                    be a key to changing society. The ability of people to run their own affairs and
                    to make things happen impressed me tremendously; that impression of a superb
                    economic team has stayed with me for these many years.</p>
                <p>Taiwan had an excellent intellectual and physical infrastructure. Most other
                    countries at a similar stage of development did not have such an infrastructure.
                    The Japanese provided Taiwan an effective agricultural system, and good
                    transportation. Many of the mainlanders who fled to Taiwan were highly educated
                    and the school system was quite modern for its time and place. So Taiwan had the
                    good fortune to be a “new” country with a reasonably effective economic
                    structure. Too many other “new countries” started with a low-base and were
                    forced to deal simultaneously with major political problem (or problems) and
                    economies that were barely functioning. Taiwan could develop its economic base
                    and it had an established if authoritarian political system. In retrospect, I
                    think the Taiwanese managed their entrance into the family of successful
                    countries pretty well.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Political development was gradual. It was a dictatorship. The expansion of
                    democracy came slowly but it came. The economic dynamism, the benefits of rising
                    incomes helped expand the middle class, which stimulated a growing interest in
                    political issues. The improving educational system - education was widely
                    respected as it is in much of East Asia - contributed enormously. All this
                    provided a basis for a remarkable change in the KMT, which continued and
                    accelerated after I left. Eventually, the KMT turned itself into a democratic
                    party. Many hope that will be repeated on the mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the rise of a middle class have any impact on the
                        development of a democratic political system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Yes, as I said it was beginning to expand. There were many
                    middle-class people who had come from the mainland. The Taiwanese themselves had
                    something of a middle-class primarily in rural parts of the country, where
                    agriculture had been developed by the Japanese. By the time I arrived, whatever
                    devastation had been created by the war had pretty much become history, so that
                    the native population was able to partake in the economic boom. I think the
                    economic expansion started in the early fifties. By the time I arrived, one
                    could see clear evidence of an “economic success story.” And that visible
                    improvement continued while I was there and vastly enhanced the middle class
                    with ensuing political benefits. That was one benefit of serving in Taiwan. Many
                    of my Foreign Service colleagues would go to a country for two or three years
                    and see no change in the economic situation.</p>
                <p>On the political side what we mostly watched was the growth of a communist state
                    on the mainland, (then) in bad economic shape. That further increased the
                    division between Taiwan and the mainland. The mainland was a one-party country,
                    but one which fought and won a civil war.</p>
                <p>While I was there we witnessed the last gasp of Taiwan's “return to the mainland”
                    policy. That of course was Chiang Kai-shek's dream. In 1962, in light of the
                    serious problems Beijing was encountering in the country especially in the
                    agricultural sector and the policy squabbles in Washington about our China
                    policy, Chiang Kai-shek decided or wanted to convey the notion that he was
                    preparing to attack the mainland. Our Station Chief, Ray Cline, was very
                    supportive. Finally, Washington told Cline to shut up and conveyed to Taiwan the
                    need for caution. I don't think anyone thought that Chiang Kai-shek would
                    actually do what he threatened, but we were concerned enough to throttle it. We
                    didn't want any trouble in the Straits or in the area for that matter. We
                    supported Taiwan's economic development program, but not its stated ambitions to
                    return to the mainland. We would not publicly state such policy, but I don't
                    think the Taiwan government had any doubts about what the U.S. would support and
                    what it wouldn't. In retrospect, it might have been Chiang's effort to muster a
                    stronger U.S. commitment to Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I should mention here that my relationship with the CIA station was essentially
                    social. I had very few, if any, business contacts with agency personnel. I made
                    friends with a few of them; I knew Cline slightly - I got to know him better
                    later in my career when I introduced him to Elliot Richardson to be considered
                    for the INR directorship.</p>
                <p>After Drumright left the ambassadorship, we had two charg�s for a long time -
                    first Joe Yager and then Ralph Clough. It was good to work for both of them.
                    They carried out policy, but were open-minded enough to listen to the staff and
                    discuss the issues. The most contentious probably being the Embassy's relations
                    with the Taiwanese community.</p>
                <p>I mentioned the bitter disputes in Washington about our China policy. I was not
                    much aware of the battles in Washington between various agencies except with the
                    CIA in 1962. In Taiwan, although various agencies and people had different
                    positions and perspectives, no one, as far as I can tell, “free-lanced” or took
                    any intra-mission debates public. At least, that is what I observed from my
                    vantage point which was that of a junior officer in a large U.S.
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did developments in Vietnam have any impact on our China
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Our involvement in that war had not begun while I was in Taiwan. We
                    were concerned by developments there - but Vietnam did not rank high on our
                    working agenda; that changed by the time I got to Hong Kong. Then it became a
                    big deal indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the issue of the UN seat come up during your
                        tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Indeed it did. The embassy strongly supported Taiwan's desire to keep
                    the “China” seat at the UN. The issue arose annually and the embassy took the
                    same position year after year. There wasn't any opposition within the embassy to
                    our position. Had we taken a different view, and had it been approved by
                    Washington, that would have had a corrosive impact on our relations with
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>In 1958 Bob Scalapino wrote what became known as the “Scanlon Report.” Scanlon
                    was a private consulting firm. He essentially concluded that a future foreign
                    policy course should be to support a “one Taiwan” policy with its claim to the
                    mainland. Not surprisingly that report was created considerable furor on the
                    island. Today, Taiwan would warmly support that conclusion in a minute. I
                    mention this because the future status of Taiwan was, and will continue to be a
                    major foreign policy issue for the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Given that context, the question of Taiwan giving up its UN seat was just not an
                    issue ripe for serious discussion in Taipei. The politics of the situation also
                    barred any serious discussion in either Taiwan or in the United States of any
                    changes in the current practice or any alternatives to the status quo. As far as
                    I was concerned, the UN seat issue at that time was not an issue meriting much
                    consideration. That would change with President Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many contacts with Washington during your
                        Taiwan tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: A few. I did return to Washington to take the A-100 course during my
                    home leave in 1961. That was a rather unique experience, because by this time, I
                    had been in the government overseas for a couple of years, unlike most my
                    colleagues who were brand new to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>It was during this time that I became more closely acquainted with some of the
                    Washington heavy weights on China - people like Lew Marks and Joe Yager, who had
                    been the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and the charg� in Taiwan and then
                    assigned to Washington to run the Taiwan desk. In Taiwan, most of my contacts
                    with Washington were via correspondence on specific issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you summarize your tour in Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I refer you to a lecture I recently gave at Harvard which covers this
                    point. I said: “For me it was an exciting period, not only because Taiwan was my
                    first time living in Asia, but also because there was still a deep exhilaration
                    in public service - the sense, at least in East Asia, you were contributing to
                    building something and you could see results. I was also the first generation of
                    FSOs after the bloodletting of the State Department's China expert - John Paton
                    Davies, John Stewart Service, Oliver Edmund Clubb among others - and the focus
                    on security during the Dulles years. There were enhanced security tests in
                    general and a cautious atmosphere on anything to do with China. The atmosphere
                    had eased somewhat when I joined the Department in 1960. In Taiwan you could
                    pretty much speak your mind in private, but one had to be careful: we called
                    Taiwan “China” and China “the Mainland”; public criticism of the Nationalist
                    government was to be avoided, and consorting too much with the nascent and
                    harassed Taiwan nationalist movement was “verboten.” It is remarkable to
                    remember now Bob Scalapino then writing the famous “Scanlon report” which
                    advocated for “one China” and “One Taiwan.” Because it denied KMT sovereignty
                    over China, it was pillories in Taiwan. Taiwan would love that situation
                    today.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk briefly about the A-100 Course. How long were
                        you in it and who were your colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I was in the course for two months. My colleagues were all white; I
                    don't remember any minority representation. We did have three or four women in
                    the class. Winston Lord was in the class and we have been long time friends. I
                    have been asked on several occasions whether being Jewish made any difference to
                    my career in the Service. I can honestly say that I never perceived an issue or
                    problem for me in the Foreign Service. As far as I remember, it rarely crossed
                    my mind.</p>
                <p>The course was not particularly interesting for me since I had already been
                    overseas and was acquainted with many of the aspects covered by the lecturers.
                    The trips that the class took - to the UN, etc. were useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had you taken your oral entrance examination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: In Washington in 1958. I don't remember who was on the board that
                    examined me, but I do recollect some of the questions that were asked. One was
                    whether I liked to “go out with the boys.” I answered that I preferred to go out
                    with the girls. This was an insidious question. You have to remember that this
                    time homosexualism was a key issue in the Department. Scott McLeod was the head
                    of security and was in the headlines for his “hard line” stance. In any case,
                    the board passed me and I was so informed a few minutes after the end of the
                    examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you returned to the economic section of the embassy
                        in Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: That is correct. I stayed in Taipei until the middle of 1962, when I
                    went to Taichung to our language school there. I got out the following year,
                    having passed the course, although, as I said, I am not a great student. I don't
                    have a “good ear” which is particularly challenging when you are trying to learn
                    a tonal language. I could read well; I never mastered writing. In any case, for
                    the work that we were being trained for in Hong Kong, reading was the essential
                    skill. In Hong Kong, I read Chinese newspapers all the time for my work.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were people like Stapleton Roy. He and his brother David had
                    been brought up in China and were almost bi-lingual. David taught at Harvard and
                    later at Chicago. Stape, of course, became one the Department's top experts on
                    China and a superb FSO. The Gleysteen brothers were of the same background; sons
                    of missionaries who were mostly bilingual. In fact, before the McCarthy era, it
                    was the sons of American missionaries in China who were the backbone of the
                    Department's China expertise. After McCarthy, the Department still had some of
                    this talent, but less and with a much lower profile.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The school tried to immerse you in Chinese. We were supposed to speak only
                    Mandarin, but lapses were inevitable given the composition of the student body.
                    I must say that the course was infinitely better that anything that I had taken
                    at Harvard or Stanford, but it was not total immersion.</p>
                <p>We studies Mandarin Chinese, the language used for official purposes. Mandarin
                    has been so widely taught over the last 40 years, that one can get along in
                    China using Mandarin exclusively. People still speak Cantonese or other Chinese
                    languages, but most everyone except perhaps senior citizens, now communicate in
                    Mandarin. At the time I took language training, that was not the case.</p>
                <p>Mandarin then was not spoken widely on Taiwan. There Taiwanese, was mostly
                    spoken; we could not use Mandarin and be understood by many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment, after language training, was to the
                        American Consulate General (CG) in Hong Kong. I think you were first
                        assigned to the passport section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: That is right. I was not very happy to be assigned to consular work
                    again, but it was the only position open in the Consulate at the time I was
                    available. I was told that as soon as vacancies occurred in the economic or
                    political sections, I would be considered. That assuaged my unhappiness to some
                    degree.</p>
                <p>My consular job was primarily devoted to Chinese fraud cases. I did spend a
                    little time on issuing passports to American children born overseas or other
                    straightforward requests, but my principal focus was on fraud cases. These were
                    generated by Chinese who would make an application swearing that they had been
                    born in the U.S., who had been brought back to China by his or her parents;
                    however all records to verify these stories had been usually lost or destroyed,
                    mostly in the great San Francisco fire. Applicants would show some documentary
                    evidence which usually had little relationship to their application.</p>

                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I would try to engage some applicants, particularly those that had
                    recently come from mainland China and explore their views on conditions in the
                    PRC. This was not a systematic process; it was a matter of opportunity primarily
                    and I did not file regular reports, unless there was something unusual. Most of
                    the applicants came from four small districts in Kwangtung Province. Most of the
                    Cantonese-born Chinese now in the U.S. came from these districts. I would guess
                    that at least half - if not much more - of the applications were fraudulent.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Since these applicants spoke Cantonese, I did not have much opportunity to use my
                    Mandarin; I had an interpreter for interviews. I did however pursue my Mandarin
                    studies with a tutor provided by the Consulate General. I read mainland China
                    newspapers. In the evenings, we often tried to mingle with Chinese and then the
                    Mandarin was somewhat helpful since Cantonese was mostly spoken. You have to
                    remember that we were in Hong Kong only 18 years after the end of the Japanese
                    occupation and only 14 years after Chiang Kai-shek's retreat from the
                    mainland.</p>
                <p>I can't say that the time in the Consular Section was very useful; it did little
                    for career development or learning. After six months, I moved to the Political
                    Section.</p>
                <p>This Political Section of the CG was devoted entirely to mainland China matters.
                    It covered both economic and political affairs in the PRC. I worked on economic
                    issues. I liked the job. I found the economic situation in the mainland
                    fascinating and often the subject of great debate. I was given wide discretion
                    and allowed to pick and choose issues to focus on. I spent much time on the
                    PRC's foreign trade especially as it impacted on Hong Kong's foreign trade and
                    was the biggest source of Beijing's foreign exchange earnings at that time. I
                    spent a lot of time tracking down visitors from the PRC to talk to them about
                    economic conditions in their country. That was the most interesting part of the
                    job.</p>
                <p>The Political Section included both economic and political officers and was
                    headed by John Holdridge. The chief of the economic section was Bill Gleysteen.
                    I worked primarily for Bill which was a delight and an excellent experience. I
                    developed a high regard for Bill's intellectual ability, his honesty and his
                    dispassionate approach to the issues that we were analyzing. Bill was a serious,
                    dedicated man.</p>
                <p>John had worked on China for a long time. He was an easy man to get along with
                    and left me pretty much to my own devices, even though he was always interested
                    in my reports and activities. I respected his competence. The first Consul
                    General I worked for was Marshall Green who was in Hong Kong for only a brief
                    period after my arrival. He was replaced by Ed Rice, who was an old “China
                    hand.” I got acquainted with both of these senior officers and liked and
                    respected both. I came to know Marshall much better during later assignments. I
                    did not see Rich much after I left Hong Kong. He was quiet, very knowledgeable,
                    very accessible, and very serious. I learned a lot about China from him.</p>
                <p>We had an agricultural attach� and we spent a lot of time together studying the
                    effects of the “Great Leap Forward” on China. Famine was a hot topic of the PRC
                    - we made estimates of the numbers who probably died. The famine raised the
                    question of the durability of the Chinese Communist regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Hong Kong was a great post, and an interesting place to live, in part because we
                    were in effect the U.S. embassy to the PRC. I was in HK during the escalation of
                    the Vietnam war. That raised the fundamental issue of PRC support for North
                    Vietnam which became a major issue for our analysis. In addition, in 1964, the
                    Chinese set off their first nuclear test which was of a course a major issue.
                    The PRC kept us all very busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your basic sources for analysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Our key source was the Chinese mainland press. That was enhanced by
                    the efforts of one of our officers to purchase all written mainland material
                    that might be available in HK. Much of that material was smuggled out from the
                    mainland - i.e., secret newspapers not publicly available to the Consulate. I
                    would have to say that in the overall analysis scheme these materials were not a
                    major contributor to our analysis. Some of my colleagues might disagree.</p>
                <p>We also kept in close contact with representatives of other countries that had
                    establishments in Hong Kong. That provided us periodically some interesting
                    information. CIA also contributed to our knowledge, although it too was a
                    limited source. There was also a considerable number of Chinese visitors -
                    businessmen, diplomats, etc. from Beijing or Shanghai. We were voracious in our
                    efforts to contact these people and to talk to them about what was going on in
                    the PRC.</p>
                <p>I was in my early thirties during my time in HK. It was a very satisfying tour
                    because the issues I was involved in were of great interest to me and to our
                    government. The work was intellectually challenging because we were working on a
                    closed society which required a lot of “tea leaves” reading. China was
                    potentially very important, an enemy of the U.S., and ranked high on the U.S.
                    interest list.</p>
                <p>We were putting together a mosaic - taking little bits of information gleaned
                    from many sources and trying to fit into the larger picture, such as portrayed
                    by the Chinese press. You also had to read between the lines and be able to
                    understand the code words that the Chinese used. The press was particularly
                    important as the Chinese moved from the “Great Leap Forward” to Mao's increasing
                    efforts to start a new “socialist education” program. You could follow the
                    supposed changes in the government's programs step by step by reading the
                    Chinese press from 1963 onward.</p>
                <p>In general, we believe that we did figure out the broad mosaic, although there
                    were a lot of surprises. For example, all of a sudden, a famous leader is set
                    aside. The day I left in August, 1966 the mayor of Beijing, a very prominent
                    party leader, was fired. We knew that something major was going on, but I think
                    we were all continually surprised by the extraordinary actions taken by the
                    government. It was the early days of the Cultural Revolution. We understood that
                    whatever machinations were being undertaken were at Mao's behest - or approval,
                    at least. This was a long process which lasted ten calamitous years.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The focus of our intelligence collection and analysis was usually some big issue,
                    for example, the stability of the regime. We were deeply interested in
                    Sino-Soviet relations and focused on the developments of the split. We were
                    eager to fathom's the PRC's attitude towards Vietnam and the war and what a role
                    it might play. Finally, we spent a lot of time working on the Taiwan issue -
                    e.g., the PRC's views of the situation in the Straits.</p>
                <p>Minutia was interesting but we had our eyes on the bigger issues. The CG in Hong
                    Kong was one of the principal contributors to this government-wide effort of
                    determining the PRC's views on major issues. We were the principal source of
                    public information and “tea leaves” reading. We also had loads of visitors from
                    the States who came for up-to-date briefings on the PRC. We spent perhaps an
                    hour each day - it obviously varied from day to day - briefing the American
                    official and unofficial visitors, including an endless procession of the media.
                    This role I think heightened even higher the intellectual excitement that our
                    work brought to us. People were clearly interested in what we were up to. We
                    were the main contact for the large American press in Hong Kong. We had numerous
                    CODELs (Congressional Delegations) interested in the PRC. That role was a major
                    contributor to Consulate morale because people had many interlocutors deeply
                    interested in our work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the CG made an impact on your visitors -
                        the press, the CODELs, etc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Absolutely. The press came to us all the time. This included some of
                    America's best journalists on East Asia. I have no doubt that we had an impact,
                    on many others to whom they talked. They have often told me so because so many
                    have been life-long friends. The journalists were professional; they did not
                    just accept our analysis and assertations, but often - not always - came to the
                    similar conclusions after doing their own further work. It was a fruitful
                    endeavor for us as well. They spent lots of time with us and I am convinced that
                    the Consulate General helped shape the American public's perception of the PRC.
                    It was time consuming - on everyone's part - but it was well spent.</p>
                <p>Of course, the process was assisted by the lively social life in Hong Kong. We
                    would meet loads of people on that circuit and were able to make our views known
                    to those we met there, some of whom were VIPs (very important people).</p>
                <p>Adding to the intellectual ferment was the fact that many reporters would go from
                    Hong Kong to Vietnam to report on the situation there. On returning to Hong Kong
                    they would pass along their more unvarnished observations. That added
                    considerably to our knowledge and kept our intellectual juices fermenting.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>As I said in my Harvard “Neuhauser” lecture: “We were an intimate part of the
                    media, particularly in Hong Kong, where all of us searched for every scrap of
                    information about China and waylaid anyone who came down from China or who had
                    escaped. In fact, the Hong Kong consulate, the de facto American Embassy in
                    China, to a great extent shaped public reporting on China in the fifties and
                    sixties. I don't mean top reporters like Stan Karnow, Joe Lelyveld, Seymour
                    Topping, Bernie Kalb, Jerry Schecter and others just wrote what we told them.
                    They certainly did not. But the Consulate because of its resources and the
                    quality of its people was an indispensable stop for reporters. It was nice to
                    get our views of China into the newspapers. Such efforts occupy much of my time
                    today, but they are no longer as much fun.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Consulate General's relationship with the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: We had vigorous exchanges. We often disagreed particularly about
                    Chinese intentions in Vietnam. There were occasionally public spats between the
                    staff in Hong Kong and Washington. Alan Whiting, for example, who was the head
                    of the INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research) section dealing with East Asia.
                    The exchanges were vigorous but mostly unpolitical.</p>
                <p>I describe some of these exchanges again in the spiel I delivered at Harvard. In
                    it, I said: “Interesting battles raged in Washington over a China we perceived
                    dimly. One, similar to our problem today with Iran and with many of the same
                    considerations, focused on what to do about China becoming a nuclear weapon
                    power as we watched it proceed to its first test in 1964. Significant internal
                    pressures to attack China's nuclear facilities were rebuffed by President
                    Johnson. A second was a real debate in 1964-65 over how China would respond to
                    the vast buildup of American forces in Vietnam and the bombing of the North.
                    Washington feared that the Chinese might come in a la Korea in 1950 and 1951 if
                    we seriously escalated. The opposing views on the Hong Kong Consulate and Allan
                    Whiting in INR became very public. Whiting, who helped George Ball argue against
                    increased deployments and of course wrote the Book China Crosses the Yalu would
                    spell out to Max Frankel in Washington why China was likely to come in in a big
                    way. In Hong Kong we would talk with the New York Times bureau chief, Seymour
                    Topping, and give our perspective on why the Chinese would not do so. The CG won
                    that argument.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>It was, of course, hard to evaluate in our policy deliberations the extent of
                    China's domestic turmoil and its impact on Chinese policy of those extraordinary
                    two decades in China. The Cultural Revolution mostly produced shakings of the
                    head in Washington and elsewhere. Despite what government specialists were long
                    telling their masters about the depth of Sino-Soviet differences, there was also
                    a skepticism on more pertinent domestic political concerns that hindered trying
                    to take advantage of the dispute. The Democrats had become gun shy on anything
                    Chinese from the damaging “who lost China” debate. The depth of Sino-Soviet
                    animosity became clear even to Washington in 1969 with the incidents along the
                    Sino-Soviet border. In the end the change in administrations from the Democrats
                    to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the American difficulties in Vietnam, and
                    China's troubles with the Soviets all continued to lead to what most China
                    watchers had long and devoutly hoped for, even if we were surprised and
                    captivated by Kissinger's secret diplomacy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your area of responsibility - the economic scene - what
                        were you observing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The big question was whether and to what extent the PRC was
                    recovering from the “Great Leap Forward.” What were the indicators of farm
                    production and what did they suggest? Was China expanding its foreign trade?
                    Were Chinese goods finding a market outside its borders? What was happening to
                    their military forces?</p>
                <p>The CG funded a trip that I took to look at the question of Chinese exports in
                    Southeast Asia. I visited six countries meeting with host government officials,
                    local leaders, and visiting Chinese department stores to analyze the size and
                    vigor of a Chinese export drive. The assumption was that if the export sector
                    was recovering, then it was likely that the Chinese domestic economy was also
                    getting back on its feet. That was an issue of great interest to Washington.
                    Hong Kong itself was of course an excellent market for cheap Chinese goods.</p>
                <p>The agricultural economy in China was, of course, most important because it was
                    the key to political and economic stability. China had gone through exceedingly
                    difficult times (1959-62) with the “Great Leap Forward.” It had wreaked havoc on
                    Chinese agriculture with the resulting death of something close to 30 million
                    Chinese - that was the experts' best guess, but no one has ever known for sure.
                    Regardless of the number, it was a devastating blow to China which made it
                    important to make some educated guesses about the state of Chinese agriculture
                    because that would have a major impact on political stability. I think that by
                    1963, we had reached the conclusion that China had essentially recovered from
                    its “experiment” and that the economy had hit bottom and was slowly beginning to
                    recover. There were still problems of agricultural production e.g., lack of
                    sufficient fertilizer (we watched fertilizer imports very closely). But I think
                    by 1963, the sense of crisis was beginning to fade; by 1966, the “Great Leap
                    Forward” was history, replaced by another extraordinary Communist event, the
                    Cultural Revolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The Chinese government had embarked on a “socialist education” campaign from 1963
                    which led us to focus on the stability of the Communist party and its potential
                    impact on agricultural production. Starting in 1965, we began to notice certain
                    trends in the press which suggested to us that a shake-up in the party was in
                    the making. By the time I left in 1966, we were certain that something real big
                    was going on in the party, but we didn't know exactly what. Even though these
                    intra-party upheavals and power-plays were not part of my portfolio, we all had
                    to be up-to-date on this process because of its very likely spill over effect
                    into political and economic areas of the PRC.</p>
                <p>Finally, we were interested in the state of the Communist party. Was it still
                    peddling old ideology? For that analysis, we depended primarily on printed
                    material - newspapers, books, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea what organizational level of the
                        Department was reading the CG's reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Our reports went to the country director and the deputy assistant
                    secretary for the region. A few went directly - or were sent by the East Asia
                    bureau - to the Seventh Floor. Most of my own reports would not have gone to the
                    Seventh Floor; my views might have been included in some summary reports on such
                    general matters as Chinese agricultural output and conditions. But I don't think
                    that as a routine matter, the CG's reports were read on the Seventh Floor,
                    except for some staffers. But, as I noted before, our exchanges with Washington
                    were mostly high level in substantive content with the office director being our
                    main interlocutor and the Assistant Secretary that of the Consul General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you note any changes in PRC attitudes or policies as
                        our involvement in Vietnam grew?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: By 1965, we had a considerable presence in Vietnam. The Chinese were
                    supplying arms and other materiel to North Vietnam and thus to the Viet-Cong. In
                    the CG we wrestled with the issue of Chinese intentions toward the war. On this
                    issue we and Washington did not see eye-to-eye generating some major debates. As
                    I previously indicated the CG thought that China would provide significant
                    assistance including perhaps even some man-power, but we never expected the
                    Chinese to enter the fray full bore - as they did in Korea. This is a very broad
                    brush description of our general view; it had some more nuanced aspects. But
                    Washington, particularly George Ball and Whiting, took a much more grave view
                    about Chinese intentions. Although I can not prove it, I think Ball and Whiting
                    in part took this dire view of likely Chinese intervention because they were
                    basically opposed to the Vietnam War, they wanted to limit our exposure, and
                    expressed deep concern as the U.S. increased its involvement. My speculation may
                    be unfair; I wasn't in Washington and privy to their deliberations, but it was
                    what I was hearing. There was certainly no question the CG and parts of the
                    Washington bureaucracy did not see eye-to-eye on the question of Chinese support
                    for North Vietnam. That was a vigorous debate which became public, as I
                    previously mentioned.</p>
                <p>We did not have a “Vietnam Hand” on the staff. I did a small amount of reporting
                    on Vietnam as did some of my colleagues. The CIA station spent a lot of time on
                    that issue. We also got plenty of visitors who had great interest in Vietnam -
                    e.g., Dan Ellsberg, Henry Kissinger. All were trying to find new approaches to a
                    difficult situation. Most of these “thinkers” visits were officially
                    sponsored.</p>
                <p>We had, of course, a large number of visits from Vietnam-stationed personnel in
                    Hong Kong for R&amp;R. I talked to some of them, particularly the ones with whom
                    I had a personal connection - classmates, colleagues from previous assignments,
                    etc. We got a fairly wide range of information both from these personal contacts
                    and from reading the correspondence between Saigon and Washington, copies of
                    which were sent to the CG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about Sino-Soviet relations during this
                        period you were in Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: That of course was very high on our priority list of topics to
                    follow. We already had indications - secret speeches, newspaper articles, talks
                    with diplomats, etc. - that bilateral relations were deteriorating. These policy
                    differences were strictly downplayed but the public exchange of letters between
                    the two sides was increasingly tough. Moreover Soviet technicians had already
                    been withdrawn from China. We had to consider whether the Sino-Soviet Axis was
                    irreparably broken and we were witnessing a change in the geo-strategic
                    picture.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Our analysis focused on the severity of the tensions - an issue that was not
                    easily answered from our vantage point. We were also faced with the question of
                    what the U.S. might do to help move the “splitting” process along. Much of
                    Washington was still quite skeptical about the nature and depth of this “split.”
                    I also don't remember much thought being given in Washington to how the U.S.
                    might take advantage of this potential divide. Adequate attention was not paid
                    to this huge foreign policy development until military incidents along the
                    Sino-Soviet border in Siberia took place in 1969. At that point the U.S.
                    government finally acknowledged that the Sino-Soviet split was real and would
                    impact on many important issues. A consensus began to build in the U.S.G. that
                    this development cried for U.S. activism and eventually resulted in President
                    Nixon's efforts to normalize relations with the PRC. This continuing development
                    was one of those defining moment in history.</p>
                <p>When I left Hong King in 1966 Washington was still in a cautious and skeptical
                    mood, not certain that the Sino-Soviet Axis was dead and required new U.S.
                    foreign policy initiatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you remember about your living conditions in Hong
                        Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: We were fortunate. We had the house on the very top of Hong Kong. It
                    looked over a great swath of the island. The house had been occupied by Mark
                    Pratt, another Foreign Service officer, who was unexpectedly reassigned from
                    Hong Kong to Laos because he had violated local regulations concerning use of
                    water on private lawns. Hong Kong was in the middle of one of its periodic
                    droughts. So the house became available. In addition to the vista, it had
                    beautiful large rooms with 40 feet ceilings. We had numerous parties - primarily
                    official ones - impossible without our excellent Chinese cook. This was the life
                    of one of the junior members of the staff and it was bracing.Our guests for the
                    most part, were associated with our work. Hong Kong was a great assignment for a
                    young FSO; it combined very interesting substantive work with a high standard of
                    living that few junior officers had the opportunity to live. Our contacts,
                    whether American, Chinese, British or other Europeans, were on the whole
                    interesting, stimulating, and forthcoming. We worked hard, but there were
                    off-setting benefits. Hong Kong was no hardship post, but an intellectually
                    stimulating hard-working one. Now, However, I have little desire to go back to
                    the island.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1966, you were transferred to the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Bob Barnett, then a deputy assistant secretary in EA (East Asia)
                    tried to get me assigned to the EA bureau. He had seen my work and was
                    apparently favorably impressed. He failed but managed to get a new position
                    established in EA and then assured me that I would be assigned to it. It was a
                    job as special assistant to Ed Fried, a deputy assistant secretary in the
                    bureau. Tony Solomon was then the assistant secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I worked for Fried for 12-18 months. It was not a demanding job. I learned a lot
                    particularly about negotiations of commodity agreements, then a very active
                    business. During my tour, the most important commodity agreements being
                    negotiated concerned coffee and cocoa. I spent most of my time actually working
                    for and with the director of the office of commodity affairs.</p>
                <p>Ed Fried, however, was a great boss. He was very smart and I learned a lot
                    sitting in on his meetings or just shooting the breeze with him. George Jacobs,
                    the office director, was also very open and available. I spent more time with
                    him than with Fried because I was part of the commodity agreement teams. Jacobs
                    became the acting DAS (Deputy Assistant Secretary) when Fried left for an NSC
                    (National Security Council) assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you, in these 18 months, learn about how the
                        Department works. This was your first Department assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: My assignment was a highly compartmentalized one. Participation in
                    commodity agreements was hardly of wide interest; it was specialized work that
                    did not really engage the day-to-day interests of a regional bureau or senior
                    staff unless countries like Brazil were involved. There were a small number of
                    offices deeply involved; occasionally, the EA assistant secretary had to get
                    involved and on rare occasions the Secretary had to be brought into the process.
                    For example, Dean Rusk had to approve when we should seek ratification of a
                    coffee agreement, which would undoubtedly become a matter for public discussion
                    and a domestic political issue. He did some missionary work trying to get, for
                    example, the coffee agreement to the Hill.</p>
                <p>Commodity agreements were relatively rarely subjected to scrutiny of bureaucratic
                    politics - strong fights among regional bureaus or between regional and
                    functional bureaus stemming from conflicting interests and approaches. The other
                    bureaus were of course kept up to date on our negotiations; that seem to
                    suffice, the less they were bothered, the happier they were. The EA bureau was
                    expected to take into consideration what the positions of the regional bureaus'
                    clients were - e.g., Brazil and Uganda and other large coffee growers in the
                    case of the coffee agreement.</p>
                <p>Working on commodity agreements introduced me to U.S. pressure groups. The
                    lobbies for the domestic producers and consumers were very active. They
                    participated in many of our meetings and frequently did business with us over
                    nice lunches and dinners. The coffee industry particularly paid close attention
                    to what we were doing. Someone from General Foods and other coffee companies
                    were always part of our delegation to the negotiations. Congress, on the other
                    hand, only became involved if a member was particularly interested in an issue;
                    its involvement became more active as we were preparing to seek ratification.
                    Congress was not a daily player.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The coffee growers were in foreign countries. Our relationships with their
                    representatives were mostly during the negotiations; or in visits to Washington.
                    We had little contact with them at other times, although occasionally the
                    ambassador from a coffee growing country would seek a meeting or we would seek a
                    session with him. Sometimes a foreign minister of a coffee producing company
                    would show up. Our relationship with the coffee growers community was mostly
                    through diplomatic channels, even during trade negotiations. Much of our
                    information came through an embassy's CERP (Comprehensive Economic Reporting
                    Program) the periodic reports filed by all of our embassies on economic issues.
                    These reports often included commentaries on the status of coffee growing
                    efforts in the host country.</p>
                <p>We were sensitive to the needs of our domestic coffee manufacturers and tried to
                    satisfy their concerns. In the main, I think they were satisfied with our
                    negotiating efforts; periodically, they might pound the table, but I don't
                    remember ever being involved in a prolonged, essentially unresolvable dispute,
                    between them and us. We worked hard to balance their interests and those of our
                    consumers. We also were sensitive to the needs of foreign growers, many from
                    poor countries where coffee was the major crop.</p>
                <p>I had a special project of my own to create a coffee diversification fund to be
                    financed by special contributions from each bag of coffee sold. At that time,
                    there was a large coffee glut which held prices way down. I was to push for
                    countries to move out of coffee growing and into more profitable agricultural
                    production. In many meetings over the year, I urged the inclusion of some
                    provision for a diversification fund in our coffee agreement. Sometimes, the
                    head of our negotiating team made the same pitch to other chief delegates in
                    plenary sessions. I often consulted our aid agency to see whether it had any
                    ideas for agricultural programs to reduce coffee production and increase
                    production of other commodities.</p>
                <p>I liked working on erecting the fund. It was my baby and my first time in
                    multilateral negotiations. It allowed me to travel a lot to places such as
                    London which I visited almost monthly working on the coffee agreements. London
                    was the seat of the International Coffee Organization. I also worked for people
                    whom I regarded highly - Fried, Jacobs, and Tony Solomon.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I am still not sure how useful that job was. It introduced me to
                    an entirely different aspect of the State Department's work. It was not a
                    subject in which I had a great interest, but it was more interesting than I had
                    expected, even though I did not feel overly challenged by my responsibilities.
                    Commodity agreements were not an area in which I felt I could make a real
                    contribution. It certainly enhanced my experience in dealing with a wide variety
                    of people. I was not sorry to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left E, you were assigned to the Senior
                        Interdepartmental Group (SIG). How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: That was probably the biggest break in my career. Sometime before I
                    left E, this SIG had been established in the office of the undersecretary (later
                    deputy secretary). It was an interdepartmental group consisting of all the
                    deputy secretaries of those governmental departments and agencies working in the
                    foreign affairs field. It was intended to oversee the coordination and
                    implementation of policies decided by the president - not the development of
                    policies although it was sometimes difficult to separate the two functions. The
                    group was part of the National Security Council apparatus.</p>
                <p>Nick Katzenbach was undersecretary at the time. He appointed as staff director
                    Art Hartman, who had a lot of both intra and inter-departmental experience. He
                    was an outstanding officer. Art got Claus Ruser to be his principal assistant;
                    he was a GS employee with very good academic credentials as an economist. He had
                    a wide ranging mind, who delved with gusto into many issues. He was like a
                    vacuum cleaner. Claus and I had met sometime before and had chatted about a
                    variety of subjects. When it came to filling out the SIG staff, Claus mentioned
                    my name to Hartman, who then called me. This was probably early in 1968. We
                    talked and Art subsequently offered me the job. For me, it was an unexpected
                    gift; it opened up new vistas - Seventh Floor, interdepartmental issues, major
                    policy initiatives involving the leadership of the Department and other
                    governmental departments and agencies.</p>
                <p>My job title was staff member of the Senior Interdepartmental Group, part of the
                    undersecretary's office. One of my principal tasks was to participate in an
                    interdepartmental study of our military relationship with South Korea. There was
                    then increasing unhappiness in the USG with Park Chung Hee and his government.
                    The working group was chaired by the DoD representative, Earl Ravenel, a deputy
                    assistant secretary in the Office of System Analysis in the Pentagon. The work
                    of this group became particularly important after the Pueblo incident. Our study
                    started with an examination of DoD's requirements for the defense of South
                    Korea. Somehow, I became involved in a study of naval requirements, particularly
                    mine-clearing efforts. This allowed me to travel to a number of military bases
                    in the U.S., looking at what clearing capabilities were available and thinking
                    on the issue. I also got involved in an examination of economic issues relating
                    to South Korea as well as beginning the study of North Korea.</p>
                <p>My sub-group eventually got combined with that of another working group created
                    because of the Pueblo incident. The administration, in light of that event,
                    undertook a study of the general American defense posture toward South Korea.
                    Joe Yager became the chairman of this working group which consisted of about
                    five members from DoD and State. I had known Joe since he was the DCM in Taiwan.
                    I think that this was the first high level review of our relationship with South
                    Korea for more than a decade. The questions posed were basic policy ones which
                    was the reason it was under Seventh Floor supervision.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We finished our report in the spring of 1968 - I think. This was a time when our
                    vision of Asia was essentially Vietnam. It permeated the Seventh Floor. We also
                    had two divisions in South Korea and there was great concern about the potential
                    for conflict on the Korean peninsula. The Pueblo episode was brought to an end
                    when Cy Vance went to the Far East and sort of apologized for the “incursion”
                    while leaving the ship in the hands of the North Koreans but getting the crew.
                    Our report outlined and recommended consideration of a program for the
                    withdrawal of our ground troops from South Korea over a five year period - no
                    gentle policy. There were considerable differences over our recommendations, but
                    I felt that the group had to issue a report which said something and caught the
                    attention of senior policy makers to make them face up to the hard realities
                    then existing on the peninsula, even if they did not accept the broad
                    recommendation.</p>
                <p>I spent full time with this working group for five to six months. As might well
                    have been expected, the report went nowhere in great part because it ran into
                    election season. It provided fodder for a lot of discussion; it was praised in
                    various quarters, but the bureaucracy was certainly not going to do anything
                    about it, particularly since it was the end of the administration. It was partly
                    resurrected by the Nixon administration when it tackled the Korean issue as part
                    of a NISM study. It may well have contributed to the development and
                    implementation of the “Nixon doctrine,” whose biggest manifestation was the
                    removal of one division from South Korea. The work of this group came in handy
                    later on for me, when I attended the Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS) in
                    London on a sabbatical, where I wrote an Adelphi paper urging South Korea to
                    start negotiations with the North on normalizing relations between the two
                    countries. I felt such a move toward dialogue would inhibit a U.S. effort to
                    remove all U.S. troops while negotiations were ongoinmy theory being that the
                    U.S. would not wish to undermine the discussions by withdrawing the troops
                    making the South Koreans anxious about their future. I felt further removal of
                    troops beyond the Seventh Division - much discussed at the time - was very
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>Regardless whether our Korea report went anywhere, the process of writing it
                    forced people to look at the situation in Korea, especially in light of a
                    terrible incident - the Pueblo - which could have generated a war. Furthermore,
                    our policy needed review in light of the sizeable Korean contribution to the war
                    in Vietnam. It was likely the view of the undersecretary that the issues were
                    likely to be considered from a fresher perspective than might happened if the
                    study was under the control of the regional bureau. I think in general that is
                    the proper approach to issues that have been dormant, frozen, or unreviewed for
                    prolonged periods. I doubt that people who have to deal with these issues daily
                    can easily step back and analyze a situation with fresh eyes.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>When not dealing with the Korean review, I spent my time dealing with minor
                    policy issues which arose in the under secretaries' committee. The staff would
                    review it and submit some recommendations to Art first and then to the Deputy
                    Under Secretary. I don't believe that I worked on any really major issues during
                    this assignment. Indeed, I felt somewhat underemployed initially, until the
                    Korean study was launched. The undersecretaries' committee agenda was not filled
                    with challenging items. Much was routine. Part of the reasons for that was that
                    the U.S. government was falling apart at the time. Rusk was hardly talking to
                    Katzenbach. Vietnam was absorbing everyone's time with much effort being devoted
                    to defending one's views and attacking others'. The country was in ferment over
                    the Vietnam War. The students were in a rage. It was somewhat akin to the recent
                    atmosphere on Iraq. The exception today is that our military is highly regarded
                    and respected unlike the situation in the late 1960's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you like working for Katzenbach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I did not see the undersecretary much until after the 1968 elections.
                    After the elections, Larry Eagleburger, who was then Katzenbach's special
                    assistant, and highly influential, was assigned as the Department's liaison to
                    Henry Kissinger. When Larry left, Art Hartman recommenced that I take his job
                    for some uncertain time. (While a SIG staff member, I had an office on the Sixth
                    Floor). I was happy to do that. I spent the last two months or so of Katzenbach
                    term as his special assistant. Of course, I did not have Larry's cache during
                    the ensuing two months, but I did what I could and had an opportunity to begin
                    to get to know many of the senior officers in the Department and learn about
                    some new issues. Since it was the end of an administration, it was not a very
                    busy period; not much was happening. Indeed, the Seventh Floor was pretty
                    dead.</p>
                <p>My view of Katzenbach is limited. I don't know what role he played in the
                    Department. But it was widely believed that he and Secretary Rusk had a
                    difficult relationship, stemming from disagreement of what to do about Vietnam.
                    Personally, I found him interesting, very smart, quite thoughtful, and a very
                    nice fellow. I learned from just watching him operate even in this gloomy
                    atmosphere. Since the Department was essentially dormant at the end of 1968, I
                    could not observe his skills as a manager and generator. He had managed the
                    Pueblo incident at the beginning of the year, but I was then not close enough to
                    see how he did that. By the time I became his special assistant, the main role
                    for the undersecretary seemed to be to insure that the transition team and
                    members of the incoming administration got all the support that they needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your perspective of the Department
                        changed when you moved to the Seventh floor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Absolutely. It was a different world in at least two ways: first, I
                    began to look at issues in a much broader context, rather than the narrow
                    confines of my previous job. I learned to neglect the unimportant side issues
                    which often take up so much time and effort by a bureaucracy. I learned to focus
                    on the key matters and what was needed in presenting an issue to the
                    undersecretary and how best to get information and analysis.</p>
                <p>Second, I learned how to operate and maneuver among the Seventh and Sixth Floor
                    principals as I tried to help obtain some consensus among them on what needed to
                    be done and how to do it. That was also necessary for my own position because
                    the quality of my presentations was important if I were to be taken seriously.
                    For any Seventh Floor senior assistant, that was essential if you were to be of
                    any value to your own principal; furthermore, it helped to build a cache for
                    future assignment considerations. Sitting in Katzenbach's office for a
                    relatively undistinguished and less than challenging two months was really the
                    stimulus for my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>Katzenbach was succeeded by Elliot Richardson, who decided to keep me in the
                    position. I knew Jonathan Moore, Richardson's senior assistant to some
                    extentfrom my Hong Kong daywhen he passed through (he was then Marshall Green's
                    special assistant). We became friends. When Richardson was appointed
                    undersecretary, he didn't know many people in the Department. So he offered me
                    the job as his special assistant. He added that he only had one incentive plan.
                    “One mistake and you are out!” He laughed; I must have smileweakly. But it was
                    this opportunity that changed my whole career. It was purely fortuitoucompletely
                    unplanned and unforeseen. Others could have done what I did, but I got the
                    chance and they didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about the staffing of Elliot Richardson's
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Richardson brought with him three people who worked for him for much
                    of his time in Washington. Jonathan Moore, his executive assistant, was the main
                    cog in the machinery; he was involved in all issues brought to the
                    undersecretary; his forte was his ability to foresee the domestic political
                    ramifications particularly as they pertained to Richardson's position in
                    Washington, but his contributions to policy development went far beyond that.
                    Jonathan was a very able officer, who had plenty of political experience and was
                    able to interact effectively at high levels in and out of the Department.</p>
                <p>Will Hastings, a lawyer, who worked for Richardson when he was the Massachusetts
                    attorney general. He was brought in on many issues, but his major focus for the
                    first year was on senior appointmentcareer and non-career as well as the
                    undersecretary's relationship with the Legal Advisor. He also, like Moore, took
                    great care that Richardson's reputation not be damaged.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Then there was a secretary, Cetta Leonardi, who was much more than that. She
                    really managed his schedule and was a constant source of frank advice and
                    counsel. She was his “protector” and knew him very well having been with him for
                    many years. She knew his habits, his foibles, his moods, and served Richardson
                    very well and was an integral part of his operation. She was totally dedicated
                    to him.</p>
                <p>I was the special assistant charged with culling out and presenting State
                    Department issues to the undersecretary. I was to make sure that he was prepared
                    for meetings and knew what was gong on in the Department. I followed up on
                    assignments that had been given to various offices, to assure that the assigned
                    work was being done in a timely fashion and was satisfactory. I helped manage
                    the undersecretary's schedule. All of these were functions that all special
                    assistants normally perform. I had a Foreign Service Officer, John Stempel, as a
                    staff assistant who reviewed much of the paperwork.</p>
                <p>Richardson also hired a speech writer, Frank Seidner, who had been with the
                    Department. Richardson used to give quite a number of speeches and remarks.
                    Frank used to draft the first version, which Richardson would then edit to fit
                    his style, and made all of his comments very much his own. He spent a good bit
                    of time on is speeches.</p>
                <p>This team worked together for all of his Richardson's tenure at State for 18
                    months which ended when he became HEW (Health, Education and Welfare) Secretary.
                    He had been an assistant secretary there during the Eisenhower administration
                    and knew well both the substance and operations of the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your role of special assistant, were you involved in
                        deciding what issues were to be referred to the undersecretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Richardson became sort of the super-manager of the Department.
                    Secretary Rogers was quite laid bacsome even said “lazy”. That left a vast
                    amount of territory for Richardson to cover. Most issues ended up on his desk
                    both because of Rogers' management style and his “Henry” problem. Richardson and
                    Henry Kissinger had developed a close relationship, although it turned out that
                    the relationship was not quite as close as Richardson had viewed it. Richardson
                    was very active in generating consideration of issues and got to know a good bit
                    of the working level of the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>He became involved in almost every issue. Alexis Johnson, the deputy
                    undersecretary for political affairs, handled most of the day-to-day issues that
                    needed Seventh Floor attention, although Richardson was at least briefed on
                    those as well and was in constant touch with Johnson's assistants. As chairman
                    of the under secretaries committepart of the NSC systeRichardson was involved in
                    inter-agency matters related to implementation of policy decisions reached by
                    the NSC. In this regard, the one committee action that received most attention
                    were the first steps which eventually led to the establishment of U.S.-Sino
                    relations. I am referring here to the removal of restrictions on American
                    foreign subsidiaries including with China and other actions of that nature. I
                    remember this effort particularly because I drafted the memorandum which
                    eventually went to the president for his approval of these confidence building
                    measures on China. It was just by accident that we were moving in the same
                    direction as the White House in changing China Policy, although, as far as I
                    know, no one in the Department had any idea what Nixon and Kissinger were up
                    to.</p>
                <p>Richardson was also responsible for the Department's nominations to the White
                    House for presidential appointments. He interviewed every one of the
                    Department's final recommendations particularly the non-career, many of who were
                    not known to him. A number of candidates who had deep pockets were seeking a
                    presidential appointment after having made sizeable contributions to the Nixon
                    campaign. Richardson examined them very carefully to make sure that they would
                    not at least embarrass the administration in their new positions. He also played
                    an important role in moving some career officers up the ladder.</p>
                <p>Richardson got heavily involved in major issues such as Vietnam (of course,
                    everyone was involved in Vietnam). He even hired a special assistant whose sole
                    role was to follow Vietnam developments. That was Charlie Cook, whom Jonathan
                    Moore had found in the Pentagon. That was a full-time job which assured
                    Richardson of being current on fast moving developments.</p>
                <p>One of the more effective channels in the government to get things done as well
                    as to smooth ruffled feathers was Richardson's relationship with Kissinger. If
                    there were any problems between the Department and the NSC or if some action
                    needed to be taken quickly by one of those organizations, Richardson would
                    invariably take it up with Kissinger and vice versa. From my vantage point, I
                    never saw Rogers as a very effective Secretary of Stateither as a policy
                    developer or a manager. He was, however, a good judge of the American public and
                    its receptivity to American foreign policy initiatives. He was an excellent
                    advisor on how to get public approval, but in the policy development fieleither
                    as a creator, implementer, or defendehe was just not in same league as
                    Kissinger. That became a real impediment to a good Kissinger-Rogers
                    relationship, because it put Rogers in a second echelon which created resentment
                    and anger on his part. Rogers was very much concerned about his personal status
                    and his stature in the public's eye. I think you have probably discerned by now
                    that I did not hold him in high regard, although I want to repeat and stress
                    that Rogers had a better feel for the public's mood and views and how to handle
                    issues publicly than probably anyone else in the government's national security
                    apparatus.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would Richardson take actions on issues that might not
                        have been on his agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Sometimes. A lot of this took place during his bi-weekly staff
                    meetings to which all deputy undersecretaries and assistant secretaries were
                    invited. Richardson used these meetings to discuss and assign actions on some
                    issues which arose, which may not have been brought to his attention through
                    formal channels. It was an opportunity particularly for the assistant
                    secretaries to seek advice from their superiors and their colleagues and to
                    bring the principals up to date on issues that were of current concern to them.
                    I think these meetings were very useful to all participants. They allowed the
                    assistant secretaries to raise issues that they might not have been able to get
                    to the undersecretary's attention in the normal course of events. And it allowed
                    Richardson to measure the competence of the senior staff. As I saw it, the
                    assistant secretaries respected Richardson and frequently asked for his
                    help.</p>
                <p>Richardson also had a great interest in the workings of the Department, quite
                    similar to those exhibited later by George Shultz. He was anxious to make sure
                    that the institution worked, that the morale and excitement were maintained. His
                    staff meetings were one of the management tools that Elliot used to monitor the
                    workings of the Department. He was interested in effective process. That
                    management interest also raised his curiosity about the Foreign Service. He
                    liked most of the officers with whom he had contact. He was always on the
                    look-out for the rising “stars”; he talked to many members of the Service and
                    had a good feel for how it operated. This was a period of “reform” led by Bill
                    Macomber, the deputy undersecretary for management. He established a number of
                    task forces which together wrote a management-reform blueprint called “Diplomacy
                    for the '70s.” Richardson was very supportive of this effort. His notion was
                    that the challenges of the 1970s required a smarter approach to diplomacy given
                    the world's complexities. It required a U.S. State Department with very capable
                    practitioners increasingly able to operate in much more complex settings. He was
                    very interested in Macomber's efforts to build a better Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>One matter in which the office was deeply involved was a huge passport problem.
                    Americans were complaining bitterly, and rightly so, that they had to wait for
                    months and months to get their documentation. Richardson was charged with
                    resolving the issue. I suggested, and he accepted, that a commission be formed
                    to quickly recommend solutions. It did so and the backlogs soon disappeared.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Richardson, of course, had a first class mind. He understood most issues quickly
                    and would easily grasp the major details. He did not have a dominant personality
                    and therefore would not always push very hard for resolution in many instances.
                    He was always highly rational with a justification for all of his
                    actionespecially when he was not inclined to getting involved. For example, he
                    tried to stay out of issues that he knew were of particular interest to the
                    secretary. He was very loyal to the secretary, and, as far as I could tell,
                    never tried to up-stage or bad-mouth Rogers. Within the State building,
                    Richardson was far more respected than Rogers, in part because he was always
                    ready to listen to the assistant secretaries or the deputy undersecretaries.
                    Rogers often mentioned how proud he was to have brought Richardson to
                    Washington, but I suspect that he was also a little jealous of Elliot's
                    prominence on foreign policy matters, and his stature in the Department.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that Rogers and Richardson were on different wavelengths. They
                    consulted frequently and I never saw any indication that Richardson tried to
                    undermine the secretary. Rogers was the boss and the final arbiter. Richardson's
                    relationships with the deputy secretarieAlexis Johnson, Nat Samuels and Bill
                    Macombewere excellent. He and Macomber had been friends for some time and were
                    very close. I liked Macomber a lot; he was forthright and even when he seemed to
                    be out-of-step or off on a tangent, I respected him. I also liked Idar Rimestad,
                    Macomber's often reviled predecessor, who was entirely different from Macomber.
                    In those days, the deputy under secretary for management “owned” the
                    Department's budget because starting with Bill Crockett, they were the creatures
                    of Congressman John Rooney (D-New York), who was the chairman of the
                    sub-committee that handled State's budget. Rooney's wishes were invariably
                    followed; the Department spent a lot of time and effort to keep him happy. So
                    one of the deputy under secretary for management's high priorities was to keep
                    Rooney and Wayne Hays happy (Hays controlled the Foreign Buildings Operations'
                    budget). Rimestad was sly, engaging, and exceedingly practical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the perspectives from the Seventh Floor so different
                        from the Sixth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: It varied. I felt I had close cooperation from the bureaucracy, by
                    and large. There were occasional clashes between the Seventh and Sixth floors,
                    but I found people like Marshall Green, Joe Sisco and other people we worked
                    with, invariably helpful. Joe had a very dominating personality and was
                    effective in getting his way. My relationships with the assistant secretaries
                    were almost always pretty friendly. They were always accessible to me, in part
                    because we knew that somewhere along the line they would ask for a favoe.g., for
                    me to intervene on their behalf with Richardson when they didn't want to take
                    the issue up themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I believe that during the period we are discussing, Richardson was a crucial cog
                    in the machinery. He was the person with whom the assistant secretaries could
                    raise issues and get help if necessary. He was aware of all of the key issues
                    facing the Department. There were certain matters that were mostly raised with
                    the secretary, but even on those, he had an input to Rogers more often than not.
                    There were times, of course, when he was traveling; then deliberations proceeded
                    without him. Yet even in those circumstances, we obviously kept him informed. I
                    think that the secretary himself may have brought Elliot up to date on certain
                    matters, but I could not vouch for that. I recollect that the two saw each other
                    frequently during the day.</p>
                <p>Richardson's interest in personnel matters stemmed from his curiosity about the
                    institution with which he is working. George Shultz had a similar approach, even
                    though their operating styles were quite different. Both Richardson and Shultz
                    were unique; it is rare for the secretary or the undersecretardeputy secretarto
                    take such interest in personnel issues, and administration, and the Foreign
                    Service. Most secretaries ignore that aspect of the Department; they generally
                    do not engage in those issuemuch to the loss of the Department.</p>
                <p>The job of special assistant was both challenging and fun. I had great affection
                    and respect for Richardson. Secondly, he gave me a lot of responsibility. I can
                    only remember one time when he got upset with me. I had argued with him on
                    something and he told me in no uncertain terms that I was wrong. That was
                    unusual; he would rarely shut off discussion. I suspect that the exception
                    occurred on a day he was preoccupied with some issues and just didn't have time
                    for my comments. But, as I said, that was the rare exception.</p>
                <p>The job also involved me in numerous issues I was unfamiliar with. I knew most of
                    the issues in Asia, but almost all other matters were foreign to me in detail.
                    So I had a major learning experience which makes the job attractive. In
                    retrospect, I probably should have focused on a few issues and become the
                    office's expert on those, but I became involved in all sorts of issues. I might
                    have specialized and found a better balance of time, but at the start, I
                    naturally focused on the undersecretary's needs which spread me quite thin. That
                    meant that on many issues my contributions were limited.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>There is one episode that I should mention. As you know, Richardson was promoted
                    to be secretary of HEW. Before leaving, he asked me what I wanted to do on my
                    next assignment. I said that at least for the time being I could probably be
                    most helpful by staying in my special assistant job and help the next
                    undersecretary get underway and then leave for another assignment. Bill Rogers
                    had become very angry with the way the public was seeing him. He felt that the
                    media was making him a caricature. The public was being led to believe that
                    Rogers was just a figurehead and that foreign policy was entirely under the
                    control of Henry Kissinger. In any case, the secretary came to believe that
                    Department staff was leaking negative stories about him to the media. For some
                    reason, according to Bill Macomber, I became one of his major targets. When John
                    Irwin took over as undersecretary, Rogers allegedly told him that I was a bad
                    apple and should be transferred to another office. Rogers' concern was
                    erroneous. I am sure I belittled him to a few Foreign Service officers, but not
                    to the media. I did periodically at Richardson's request have contacts with the
                    media, but I never discussed Bill Rogers. The secretary was right in his
                    assessment of the situation, but had the wrong suspect. I did not feel any
                    particular loyalty to him and did express my views of his leadership to a number
                    of people. My views were shared by many, probably most in the Department. The
                    negative views of him could have come from many sources in the Department.</p>
                <p>It was a difficult period for the Department. Richardson was the luminary; even
                    Rogers publicly stated how proud he was that he had chosen Elliot to be his
                    deputy. But I am sure that the situation was uncomfortable for Rogers. Despite
                    the secretary's situation, I think the Department ran pretty well during this
                    period since we had a number of competent leaders who actually ran the show. The
                    rest of us did the “grunt” work and between the two groups, the process worked
                    reasonably well. But it was a White House dominated process.</p>
                <p>As I said, I was told all of this confidentially by Macomber. Beyond telling
                    Macomber that the secretary was all wrong, I didn't do anything further. I am
                    not sure that Macomber believed me; he may well have agreed with Rogers. After
                    Richardson left and before Irwin arrived, Macomber asked me what I wanted to do
                    next. I had already talked with Irwin who seemed to be a very decent man. I told
                    Macomber that I thought that given the situation it might be time for me take
                    some time off from the daily work grind and spend it in some kind of
                    academic-research institution. I mentioned the International Institute for
                    Strategic Studies in London. This was a stretch for someone at my grade level,
                    but having been the special assistant to the undersecretary certainly made it
                    possible.</p>
                <p>I wanted to go to London. I wanted to join a prestigious and small institution,
                    which IISS really was. I had met a few members and fellows and was impressed by
                    their caliber. I was familiar with the IISS publications which I think were
                    highly regarded. And so it was off to London and a very good eight months at
                    IISS.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I must say that Macomber was more than solicitous as far as I was concerned. I
                    hope it was because he was impressed by the work I had done for Richardson. In
                    any event he backed me in any way he could. He was extremely helpful.</p>
                <p>IISS was very happy to have me, particularly since I came at no cost to them,
                    except for some office space. This situation allowed me to choose whatever
                    issues I wanted to explore further; I had complete freedom to do what I
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>I wrote a paper in 1972 while at IISS which generated quite a stir and may have
                    had some influence on policy makers. It was entitled “Moving the Glacier”. Not
                    surprisingly it got plenty of attention in Korea. The U.S. had just pulled out
                    the Seventh Division from South Korea as part of the Nixon doctrine which called
                    for more self-reliance on part of our allies. I noted that the long-range answer
                    to the tensions on the peninsulhowever remotwas a North-South dialogue leading
                    eventually to a peace agreement and unification. I took the position that the
                    withdrawal of our troops was inimical to the achievement of that long-range goal
                    because it reduced any incentive the North might have in coming to the
                    negotiating table. I mentioned this paper earlier while discussing my role as a
                    member of the SIG review calling for a withdrawal of U.S. troops over an
                    extended period of time in part on grounds that our participation in the Vietnam
                    war had so soured the American public that it would probably not support any
                    further American military involvement overseas and particularly in Asia.</p>
                <p>But when I got to IISS, I took another look at the situation and came to a
                    different conclusion, namely, that the presence of American troops in Korea was
                    essential to the maintenance of stability on the Korean Peninsula and the
                    achievement of long range goals of peace and eventually unification. Part of the
                    reason for my change of view was that the U.S. domestic situation had changed.
                    Furthermore, as the junior member of the SIG working group, I went along with
                    the views of my seniors, who felt stronger then me; since 1968 I had gained
                    considerable experience and knowledge and could strike out on my own. I also
                    came to the conclusion that some sort of d�tente on the Korean peninsula and
                    ultimately negotiations between South and North was essential. In fact, the two
                    agreed to start talks in 1972.</p>
                <p>I had been in Korea only once on one of my trips to the area. But as I said, I
                    had learned a lot working in the undersecretary's office. My paper was published
                    by IISS after I had left and, as I said, was widely read in Korea. Three years
                    later, I think when I accompanied Secretary Schlesinger to Korea for an annual
                    Security Consultative Meeting, President Park Chung Hee congratulated me for it.
                    I also got a new Korean watch from hias did all the other members of the
                    Schlesinger delegation; the Koreans had just started a watch manufacturing
                    enterprise. It stopped after a month.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The year at IISS brought me into contact with a wide variety of people. My office
                    roommate was a senior Japanese Foreign Office official, with whom I have stayed
                    in contact over the years, Yoshio Hatano, who became Japan's UN representative.
                    Percy Cradock, who at the time was head of the UK Foreign Office's policy
                    planning staff and later became chief advisor to Prime Minister Margaret
                    Thatcher and chief intelligence advisor. These people and others became an
                    informal advisory committee for me as I wrote the paper on Korea. The informal
                    group met three times and was enormously helpful. I am still very proud of that
                    paper. It said something.</p>
                <p>During the period immediately following the end of my special assistant
                    assignment and before leaving for London, I wrote a small book with Dick
                    Moorsteen then at the Rand Corporation, called “Remaking China Policy” which was
                    published in 1972. I was essentially on my own with the Department, which let me
                    do what I wanted before I went to IISS. I went back and forth to California to
                    work with Dick on this book. He had been a special assistant to Katzenbach when
                    he was undersecretary, working primarily on Vietnam, although he was really a
                    China expert. We finished this book in two months; I am also proud of that work
                    because it was written clearly and in simple declarative terms, and also said
                    something. It was indeed perhaps more a long paper than a book. In it, a reader
                    will find the outline of what was to become the “Shanghai Communiqu�" after the
                    Nixon visit. The essence of our proposal was “One China, but not now” which
                    became the administration's position. That was one of the few favorite phrases I
                    have coined; the other one was “From dominos to dynamos.”</p>
                <p>Of course, we were not the only ones that were urging the U.S. government to take
                    the position that it eventually took in the “Shanghai Communiqu�.” Paul
                    Kreisberg of the Department had come to the same conclusion.</p>
                <p>The book covered China associated issues of the timIndochina,
                    Sino-Soviet-U.S.-relations, Taiwan. It was an effort to have people focus on
                    what a dialogue with the PRC might cover and what policy decisions would have to
                    be reached before such a dialogue could take place.g., the position of Taiwan.
                    Harvard Press published the book, although Rand had already published it as a
                    “Rand Volume.” When I left for London, the draft had been completed. At the
                    request of Harvard Press, which wanted a longer document, Moorsteen then picked
                    a number of documents which accompanied our analysis and became part of the
                    published book. The book got excellent reviews in academic journals. The New
                    York Times reviewer was a woman whom I had dated at Harvard, who had become a
                    “radical left winger” and had joined “The Committee of Concerned Asian
                    Scholars”, a pro-Maoist group antagonistic to the Vietnam War. She wrote that
                    the book had a fundamental flaw in that it did not deal with the “destructive
                    war” that the U.S. was waging in Vietnam. She was right, our book was not about
                    Vietnam; it was about China and that was damming to her. So The New York Times
                    commentary became the exception to the generally favorable attitude of other
                    reviewers. Of course, our date may have worse than I thought. She became a
                    prominent scholar.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect, was your “time out” useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: It was. It helped me decompress which I needed after my tour in the
                    undersecretary's office, which was “14 hour” days, often seven days per week. I
                    don't complain about the work-load; in fact, I enjoyed it a lot. But I needed a
                    change of pace, just to return to a “normal” family life. We had a lot of fun in
                    London.</p>
                <p>I can't say that my period at IISS was a “serious” one. But it helped me
                    intellectually in becoming more thoroughly acquainted with an issue which has
                    bedeviled the foreign policies of many countries over decadeand is still
                    unresolved today. I still write about it. I also met many foreign policy
                    officials and academics whom I would not have engaged otherwise. So I am a
                    supporter of an academic assignment for all officers sometime during their
                    careers. I think that an assignment to an institution such as IISS may even be
                    better than a tour at a war college or other governmental institutioneven those
                    academically orientebecause it enables one to escape the bureaucratic
                    environment. These assignments do not seem to have much attraction in today's
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, I shared an office suite with a Japanese foreign ministry
                    official. He eventually became the Foreign Ministry's spokesman as well as
                    ambassador to the UN. We became close friends. He introduced me to a number of
                    his friends and acquaintances, which was the beginning for me of a long
                    relationship with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. That was very useful when I
                    became the POLAD to CINCPAC and later deputy assistant secretary for East Asia
                    in DoD/ISA. IISS, now a larger impressive institution, even than had a good
                    representation of people from all over the world. It made sure that
                    non-Britishers were well represented. The deputy director was a German, Chris
                    Bertram. I invited Bertram to participate in a program while I was president of
                    the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He was a prominent journalist as
                    well as head of a “think tank.” He spent a year with us at Carnegie. So used
                    some associations into life-long friendships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1972, you were assigned to the Inspection Corps. How
                        did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I was there for less than 6 months. I wanted to return home and the
                    choice of vacancies coming up was pretty thin and this seemed potentially
                    interesting. Tom McElhiney was then heading up the Inspection Corps. I thought
                    that some, if not most, of the Inspection Corps's work might begin to review
                    U.S. policies and examining our approach to major policy problems that a bureau
                    or office might be confronting. The Inspection Corps had just been reorganized
                    and I had the impression that policy questions would become an important focus
                    of my work. I was not too excited by McElhiney's objectives for the IG; I didn't
                    think that his approach would make much of a dent in the Department. I quickly
                    came to the conclusion that a full tour in the IG would be a waste of time for
                    me. This was the only assignment I positively disliked.</p>
                <p>After a few months in the Inspection Corps, I was approached by Paul Popple, then
                    the director of the East Asia division of INR. He asked whether I would be
                    interested in becoming his deputy. I readily accepted; it was an opportunity to
                    return to East Asia issues and permitted me to quickly leave the Inspection
                    Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at some stage, Paul Popple called you. Had you known
                        him before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Only slightly. But he knew my background and had read my writings on
                    China and Korea, and was acquainted with my views and style. I was certainly
                    ready to get out of the IG. Paul was a very fine man; and I liked him a lot. He
                    was a man of great probity, not reluctant to give his opinion even if it didn't
                    fit the “prevailing winds.” I also liked that he mostly let me run the division,
                    that is to direct the research efforts of INR's East Asia division. I should
                    note this was my first “managerial” job.</p>
                <p>The director of INR was George Denny, who at the time was actually “acting”
                    director. INR at the time had six or seven divisions in imostly mirroring the
                    regional bureaus' organization. We had a China office, a Japan office, a
                    south-east Asia office, etc. This was my first opportunity to become better
                    acquainted with south-east Asia; I had focused previously on north-east Asia
                    (China, Korea, Taiwan) although some of my analytical work in Hong Kong on PRC's
                    foreign policy brought me into contact with issues in other Asian countries.</p>
                <p>This new job was a learning experience. I briefed Marshall Green, the East Asia
                    assistant secretary, on a daily basis. I got to know him even better and we had
                    a very good substantive relationship. He always asked for my thoughts on major
                    issuenot policy recommendations, but my thoughts on the significance of the
                    intelligence. I also got to know the bureau staff well; and worked closely with
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The assignment worked out well. I got managerial experience. My understanding of
                    East Asia grew exponentially and lastly, I became well acquainted with both the
                    leadership and the staff of the East Asia bureau as well as those in other
                    agencies working on East Asia. Broadly speaking, ouINR'responsibility was to
                    provide good analysis of major events and trends in East Asia and to estimate
                    the potential eventual impact of these events and trends on U.S. policy in the
                    region. We were not an intelligence gathering agency; we were the recipient of
                    intelligence gathered by other parts of the U.S. government; our people tried to
                    “connect the dots”, as it is described today, based on the information received
                    as well as their own knowledge of the area and its history. The mix of Foreign
                    Service and senior Civil Service officers provided a unique set of skills which
                    was not available to other agencies. My view of that was further reinforced when
                    I became assistant secretary of INR several years later. The mixture of the
                    field experience of a Foreign Service officer combined with the long term
                    attention that a Civil Servant had devoted to a particular subject made for a
                    formidable analytical team. This mixture of skills and knowledge provided a
                    useful support to the policy maker.</p>
                <p>We were able to respond in crisis situations with instant analysebriefings, short
                    papers, longer term analysis, etc. since we were almost always up-to-date on
                    events and currents in the part of the world for which we were responsible. We
                    provided daily both information analysis which we felt would be useful to policy
                    makers; many of the Foreign Service officers had been in policy making positions
                    and the Civil Service officers had been close enough to that process for long
                    periods so that they had an understanding of the needs of senior officials. My
                    period in INR-EA was another useful learning experience which came in quite
                    handy when I became the Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>I am not a dispassionate observer of the policy making process for the East Asia
                    area. I believed then and do so today that INR-EA could usefully contribute to
                    policy making. There is the mantra of the purists who insist that a sharp line
                    should be drawn between intelligence estimates and policy making. This has
                    always been a problem which became much more acute for me when I was INR
                    assistant secretary. In contrast to my INR-EA period, by the time I became
                    assistant secretary, I had long been involved in policy making and that made the
                    maintenance of this “Holy Grail” of separation much more difficult to maintain.
                    While working in EA/INR, I was still in the early stages of my career and
                    although my work in the undersecretary's office obviously brought me into
                    contact with policy making at the highest level, I had not yet begun that part
                    of my career and therefore trying to maintain some separation between
                    intelligence analysis and policy makinartificial as it might seewas not a major
                    challenge. I wasn't shaping our EA policy; I was trying to support those
                    responsible for policy making. I must say that despite some outside skepticism,
                    I always found INR tried to maintain the distinction scrupulously.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I had about 20-25 people working for me. It was a big office, particularly by
                    State standards. We did a lot of useful work, some not so useful. I think we
                    generated a lot of ideas which were analyzed by others and some were even
                    accepted by the intelligence community. We had considerable attention for our
                    work and a good number of kudos.</p>
                <p>That assignment also brought me into Vietnam, an area which had never been at the
                    top of my agenda. No one had ever asked me to get involved either in Washington
                    or in Vietnam itself. I was seen primarily as a “China expert”.</p>
                <p>I am not sure what level I had reached in the Service at the time. I think I was
                    probably an FSO-perhaps even a 2. In any case, I was quite young for the
                    position which had been offered, regardless of grade. That was never an issue
                    either with my staff or my bosses.</p>
                <p>I think my approach to management was viewed positively by my staff. I encouraged
                    them to write and to express their views directly. I wanted them to take
                    initiatives both with me and with the people they worked with. I wanted them to
                    propose what issues I should take up with my superiors and “clients”. I tried to
                    develop a vigorous intellectual atmosphere and I enjoyed it when the discussion
                    became so. I had some very good people working for me. For example, Evelyn
                    Colbert, a wonderful woman, was a legend in the Department for very good
                    reasons. There were countless others. Evelyn was a civil service officer and
                    therefore a permanent fixture in INR. The Foreign Service officers who used to
                    spend only a tour in INR, were also very good, as I remember them., particularly
                    those working on Vietnam, most of whom had been there. There may have been an
                    exception or two, but in general, I found the FSO's to be capable and
                    interested. In those days the Bureau had an opportunity to screen potential
                    assignees. I would review their background, talk to people who worked with the
                    candidate, and try to assure myself that the FSO would fit in well in a Bureau
                    whose work was different than that of regional bureaus. We would also try to
                    entice people to work in INR.</p>
                <p>Paul and I worked well together. He never said that he was the boss; he never
                    worried about his prerogatives. He did not stand on ceremony. He focused
                    entirely on the substance of issues. Whenever I needed help, he was always there
                    to help. He was very smart but not particularly a creative man. He had high
                    standards which he expected others to meet. He allowed his staff to do its work
                    without interference, encouraged them in their efforts, and listened carefully
                    to their views.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>My experience in INR was quite positive. I came away from that assignment with
                    respect for the institution and its people. I thought the bureau made a very
                    significant contribution to understanding. I think that Marshall Green, who was
                    my most important “client”, shared my views. He always wanted his INR briefing;
                    he always wanted to discuss issues with us. He gave us plenty of his time, which
                    is a precious commodity for a regional assistant secretary. He would always ask
                    for further analyses and information, particularly on Vietnam. He may have been
                    somewhat unique in the Department because a lot of FSOs, particularly those in
                    regional bureaus, often did not view INR as useful. They would look at us as
                    “rivals” with sometimes differing views from them, which would require them to
                    justify their views. As long as INR agreed with their views of the scene, they
                    really didn't mind having us around. But when we disagreed, that, of course,
                    raised tensions and generated requests from these regional bureau officers to
                    “mind our own business.” We got a considerable amount of resistance from some
                    regional bureau officers, particularly office directors. But Marshall always
                    stood by us and continued his practice of seeking our views and work. I
                    shouldn't make this rivalry sound like a war; much of it was good natured. It
                    was not personamost of the time.</p>
                <p>I should mention at this stage the INR relationship with other agencies. I had
                    had some experience with the CIA in Hong Kong and Taiwan. But the INR job
                    required broader exposure to the total intelligence communitCIA, NSA and DIA
                    especially. We had to work together to produce “community products.” (NIEs, for
                    example which at the time were viewed with a reverence that they probably did
                    not deserve.) We spent a lot of time working on those documents. I found this
                    experience “eye opening.” I began to understand the collection capabilities of
                    other agencies. I also began to understand some of the institutional biases
                    which all bureaucracies have. My main focus was on intelligence analysis; I did
                    not for example have a need to know much about covert actions. I can't remember
                    if I ever had any contacts with the Deputy Director for Operations in the CIA.
                    But in my first real exposure to the totality of the intelligence collection
                    apparatus of the USG, I was fairly impressed by the magnitude of our
                    efforts.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Helen Louise Huntemy wife's classmate at Bryn Mawr and a superb CIA employee of
                    long standinintroduced me to a small group of her fellow analyst8-10 peoplin the
                    Special Project Office. That group did the best long-term intelligence analysis
                    in the U.S. government that I witnessed. Most of the work was on such issues as
                    Sino-Soviet tensions, North Korea internal scene, the Indonesian coup and other
                    major concerns. They selected the issues of the day which seemed to lack
                    information and understanding and tried to deal with them exhaustively. The
                    analyses have been declassified allowing Hunter to write a book on the work that
                    she did for the group on Indonesia and North Korea. Working with the Special
                    Projects Office showed me a few talented people with insights working together
                    with unfettered access to the widest possible range of all available
                    information, allowed free range unhindered by a requirement to “clear” their
                    views with the bureaucracy, could produce. Once that group had finished its
                    worall done within the officit was published for the rest of the government.
                    Kissinger became a consumer of this work; I witnessed that while flying on his
                    airplane with him back from London. For reasons that I never understood, Jim
                    Schlesinger, when he became head of CIA, abolished this unit. It was a mistake.
                    This office's analysis usually dealt with the future, although, as in the 1965
                    Indonesian coup, the analysis was of past events in an obvious effort to learn
                    lessons from history.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether any of the reports reached Rogers; I know that Richardson
                    read some of theparticularly the ones that dealt with Vietnam. The only
                    comparable efforts today that use the special projects unit's approach are the
                    IG's reports which are not exactly intelligence reports, but use information
                    widely scattered in the bureaucracand some outside of iand try to put it
                    together in a meaningful publication. The quality of those reports are very much
                    like those issued by the Special Projects Office. I believe the U.S. government
                    would be well served by the re-establishment of such an effort, if it hasn't
                    already been done so. It might have been helpful on Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't it vital for the senior policy makers to have read
                        these analyses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Sure it would be nice, but realistically not likely. The leadership
                    does not have to read the analyses. Someone on their staffparticularly their
                    immediate staffcan become familiar with them. The key action is that there be at
                    least a briefing and dialogue between a member of the personal staff of the
                    senior officer and a senior member of a bureau. It is important that the
                    personal staffs be up-to-date so that they can provide their principal news of
                    recent developments. Of course, I am assuming that these personal staffs are
                    top-notch; they had to have the confidence not only of the senior official, but
                    the bureaucracy as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That raises the question of whether you were satisfied
                        that the appropriate people were getting your analysis (besides Marshall
                        Green, whom you have already described as an avid consumer)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: All of our analyses went to the offices of the Secretary and the
                    Deputy Secretary and the Under Secretaries. I don't know who read the reports,
                    probably one or more of the staffers concerned with the area. On occasions, I
                    would call the attention of the personal staffs to particular analysis and
                    findings. I couldn't get to Rogers, but I knew Herb Okun, who then worked for
                    the Secretary, for example and I would alert him to specific papers. I did the
                    same with Nick Veliotes who then was working for Deputy Secretary John Irwin.
                    They were friends from my days with Richardson. I probably could have gotten
                    access to Irwin, who knew me. I didn't need to do that because I knew so many of
                    the Seventh Floor staffers from my days with Richardson.</p>
                <p>I can not recall ever getting any feed-back from the principals. Some papers
                    might come back marked “Many thanks” or “Good report” or occasionally even with
                    a question. But I don't remember any report becoming the subject of a dialogue
                    between a principal and INR. Our best customers probably was S/P with whom we
                    collaborated on a number of analyses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about some specific issues. What work did INR
                        do on Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I began in INR/EA just as the negotiations on a peace agreement in
                    Vietnam were beginning. Our work was mostly concentrated on events on the
                    grouni.e., the fighting, its political significance, the impact on the
                    government in Saigon, etc. We also focused on what North Vietnamese intentions
                    seemed to be and what they would likely do. We were quite comprehensive in our
                    scope of work. These analyses were also forwarded to our negotiating team. I
                    remember that after one major military engagement, we wrote a paper entitled
                    “Have we turned the corner?” I would describe our efforts as a continual watch
                    of and interpretation of events unfolding in Vietnaboth north and south. The
                    Paris talks were on-going and we tried to provide our negotiators with
                    information and analysis we thought would be useful in their work.</p>
                <p>We knew nothing of Kissinger's dealings with China before the general election.
                    We were surprised by the visit, as was most of the country. But even before and
                    certainly after the trip, we were writing papers for Secretary Rogers and
                    Marshall Green, who were part of Nixon's delegation. We, of course, spent a lot
                    of time on Sino-American relations, the subject of a small book that I mentioned
                    earlier. The subject was of great interest to me which may have also contributed
                    to the amount of time we spent on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I was deeply impressed by Kissinger's initiative. It was a real achievement. I
                    would call it “A Great Leap Forward” to use a familiar Chinese phrase. I had
                    always been on the side of those who wanted to change our China policy. The
                    first step in making a change occurred while working for Elliot Richardson. We
                    allowed American subsidiaries abroad to do business with the PRC. I was
                    surprised by the giant step that the Nixon administration took. I as well as
                    many others saw the potential benefit of our change in China policy as a step
                    toward resolving the Vietnam conflict changing the Soviet orientation. So the
                    initiative was deeply relevant to our country's most vexing foreign policy
                    problems at the time.</p>
                <p>At this point it might be useful to quote again from the paper I delivered at
                    Harvard in 2006. It summarizes my views on Sino-American relations over the
                    years including in the Foreign Service and repeats some of the previous
                    discussion. “China was very much part of my various jobs. During my graduate
                    days in Cambridge professors and students including me sneered at Professor
                    Dixie Walker's perverse views of China communism during its early rule. Walker
                    supposedly had gone way overboard in his criticism of communist rule in his book
                    China Under Communism: The First Five Years. Well he was right on what was going
                    on in China, and we at Harvard and most other universities were wrong. That came
                    home in spades, except to the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars, in the
                    incredible human catastrophes of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural
                    Revolution.”</p>
                <p>“Cataclysmic events in China coupled with our extreme limited access and
                    knowledge often prompted fierce interagency debates, almost always between the
                    State Department and the CIA. The Great Leap Forward produced a huge argument
                    over whether China would fall apart because of the severity of the food
                    situation, “the downward spiral” as Joe Alsop called it in the China Quarterly.
                    The outside community provided little insight on China's actual situation with
                    the exception of the famous Father Ladany in Hong Kong. In the end the State
                    Department was proved right in its more optimistic view of China's ability to
                    get by the terrible shortages, although it lowballed the number of deaths.
                    Parenthetically, such fights over ignorance have continued to this day about
                    countries we are isolated from, including North Korea and most vividly,
                    Iraq.”</p>
                <p>“China's potential for breakdown and our internal debate converged at other
                    times. One interesting episode that I followed closely in Taiwan in 1962 was
                    when the Nationalist government publicly started planning to “counterattack” the
                    mainland and levying all sorts of taxes to support an invasion. A brief effort
                    to rally U.S. support for the KMT was led by Defense and the CIA, particularly
                    the station chief in Taiwan, a Harvard PhD and former junior felloRay Cline. The
                    Kennedy administration told Chiang Kai-shek to forget about it. It was the last
                    gasp of Chiang's return to the mainland ideology. The excising of the myth
                    contributed to greater openness on Taiwan.”</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>“Other interesting battles raged in Washington over a China we perceived dimly.
                    One, similar to our problem today with Iran and with many of the same
                    considerations, focused on what to do about China's becoming a nuclear power as
                    we watched it proceed to its first test in 1964. Significant pressure to attack
                    China's nuclear facilities were rebuffed by President Johnson. A second was the
                    debate in 1964-65 over how China would respond to the vast build up of American
                    forces in Vietnam and the bombing of the North” which I discussed
                    previously.</p>
                <p>“It was, of course, hard to evaluate in our deliberations the extent of China's
                    domestic turmoil and its impact on Chinese policy of those extraordinary two
                    decades in China. The Cultural Revolution mostly produced shakings of heads in
                    Washington.”</p>
                <p>Back to my employment history. Richardson was appointed Secretary of Defense in
                    mid-1973. I went to work for Defense in the fall. So I was in INR for about one
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an opportunity to interact with the NSC
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I had meetings and conversations with NSC staffers working on East
                    Asia, particularly on China. My experience in East Asia plus my tour with
                    Richardson had given me a wide range of contacts which grew while in INR. I
                    think by the time I had finished my INR assignment, I knew and had access to
                    most, if not all, the EA players. I felt at ease in bringing issues to their
                    attentioissues which they might not have focused on in a normal day, given their
                    schedules.</p>
                <p>I remember that after the Vietnam peace settlement, Bill Sullivan called a number
                    of us together to talk about implementation. That was an unusual role for an INR
                    member because it involved us in operational matters.</p>
                <p>I liked my time in INR. As I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed being a manager. For
                    the first time in my career, I gave out assignments and focused the staff on
                    common objectives. I had to chart that course and see that it got done. It was a
                    liberating experience. I also learned to lead a group of very disparate staff
                    members, all sorts of different types. I learned how to better extract the good
                    work from people and in the process, how to produce the best I could from
                    myself. I came to the conclusion that to motivate your staff, you had to earn
                    its respect. In this case the response to leadership was the ability both to add
                    some important insight and knowledge to the analytical process and to have
                    access to important policy makers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1972, you went to DoD to be a special assistant to
                        Secretary Elliot Richardson. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Richardson had always asked for my advice on personnel matters,
                    particularly on Foreign Service officers, when I worked for him. He didn't
                    necessarily follow my advice, but he asked. He must have appreciated whatever
                    contributions I might have made because one day, while I was working in INR, he
                    called me and asked me whether I would be interested in moving to his DoD office
                    to help him find and recruit top peoplespecially the presidential appointments.
                    I readily agreed. What he wanted me to do was going to be interesting in itself,
                    but it was also not a job that would last for too long. I thought it would lead
                    to an established DoD policy position. I also would again be working for a man I
                    greatly liked and respected. I should mention that when Richardson called me he
                    was still Secretary of HEW, but knew that after the new administration would
                    take over in 1973, he would be nominated to be Secretary of Defense
                    (SecDef).</p>
                <p>A few weeks later, I reported for duty in the SecDef office, although Richardson
                    had not yet moved from HEW. In fact, I had two bosses: one was Richardson and
                    the other was the new deputy secretary, William P. Clements, Jr. a Nixon choice,
                    not Richardson's. Clements had been the CEO of a large Texas firm and a big
                    contributor to the Republican Party. He later became governor of Texas. They
                    were entirely different personalities with often varying views. Richardson
                    wanted Clements in the personnel process so I had to please two people, which
                    was not always easy. Richardson was a liberal, open-minded eastern Republican
                    and Clements was a narrow minded, conservative southern Republican. Clements was
                    also very shrewd and knew what chains to pull to get things done. He exuded a
                    command presence. In fact, we became friends and he later relied on me when I
                    became deputy assistant secretary in the Office of International Security
                    Affairs (ISA).</p>
                <p>I consulted frequently with Jonathan Moore who had been Richardson's principal
                    assistant for many years, including at State and did the same with Richardson at
                    DoD. Jonathan had Richardson's full confidence and was the secretary's eyes and
                    ears, and players in a large range of topics. Jonathan had called me after
                    Richardson's offer and urged me to accept it. He had moved to the Pentagon
                    before Richardson did and was the principal advance man.</p>
                <p>Richardson had also recruited two other people to work in his office; one was
                    Dick Darman, who subsequently became a key member of the administration and
                    later OMB head under Reagan. The other was J.T. Smith who later became a
                    prominent lawyer in Washington.</p>
                <p>I was given an office and told to go to work to propose suitable people to fill
                    the large number of presidential appointments in the Pentagon, including jobs in
                    the office of the secretary, the service secretaries, and their under- and
                    assistant secretaries. I would work up a list with my recommendation which were
                    vetted by Richardson and Clements. Eventually, their choice would be sent to the
                    White House for approval and processing and submission to the Senate for
                    confirmation. Among my “finds” were such people as Bill Perry, Malcolm Currie
                    who became director of defense engineering, and Frank Shrontz who eventually
                    became president of Boeing. Not all my recommendations survived - the White
                    House after had its own candidates.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>The one position that gave me considerable trouble was the assistant secretary
                    for ISA. I had talked to numerous people about candidates; it was also a
                    position with which I was quite familiar with, the DoD counterpart in great
                    measure to the politico-military office in State. I finally put together a list
                    of recommendations for the secretary. But all my work went for naught because
                    the White House chose the person and it was Bob Hill. I found that out from
                    Richardson when he told me that he was seeing Hill that afternoon. I should add
                    that such White House involvements were not unusual; periodically, the political
                    side of the president's office has a “supporter” it had to place. I don't
                    remember the White House turning down one of Richardson's recommendations and
                    substituting their candidate.</p>
                <p>I also enjoyed this job. It brought me into contact with a huge range of people
                    who later became associates in government and friends. Invariably everyone was
                    certainly willing to discuss other people, both positively and negatively. I
                    found no shortage of opinions and no lack of volubility. It is not a job that I
                    would have found interesting for a long period; I did it for five months and
                    that was just fine. It ended when Richardson became Attorney General; he was in
                    DoD for about four months.</p>
                <p>That change came at a very bad time for me. I was interested in becoming a
                    special assistant to the secretary of defense. That job had a wide range of
                    responsibilities, including defense strategy, politico-military issues, etc.
                    With Richardson's departure, my chances for that job of course decreased
                    substantially. Jim Schlesinger became the next secretary. Before his taking
                    over, I went to see him. I had known him slightly, and he had known of me
                    through a number of mutual acquaintances. Our conversation was mostly about the
                    people he would inherit. I told him of my interest in the special assistant
                    position, which he said he would consider. But in the final analysis, he chose
                    someone else who he viewed as having had far more experience in defense matters.
                    That left me essentially unemployed. I guess I could have stayed in DoD, but
                    none of the vacant positions to which I could reasonably aspire seemed that
                    attractive. There were some other positions that were interesting, but they were
                    already filled.</p>
                <p>I might say at this juncture that I liked working in DoD. I enjoyed my first tour
                    which I just described and then later on I enjoyed my four year stint as a
                    deputy assistant secretary in ISA. I was attracted by the straight forward
                    operational style. The discussions were very much open with each participant
                    calling the situation as he or she saw it. There were, of course, some private
                    negotiations on the side, but forthrightness was usually the coin of the realm.
                    The Pentagon was more open than the State Department where the basic operational
                    mode was for each bureau to keep issues to itself as much as possible and where
                    sharing of information and views not always prevailed. In State, an objective
                    sometimes was to keep other bureaus out of issues; in the Pentagon,
                    inclusiveness was usually one of the operating goals.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Having said that, I should note that my experiences in the Pentagon were limited
                    to a rather small group, which could react quickly and had direct access to the
                    secretary. In both of my DoD jobs - special assistant and then deputy assistant
                    secretary - I had direct access to the secretary. So essentially, when I was a
                    DAS, I would consult with the secretary and then inform the assistant secretary
                    of what had taken place. That obviously made my working life easier. I worked
                    often with the uniformed personnel in the Pentagon; whom I usually found direct,
                    and candid. That is not to say that they didn't play “games” and have their own
                    machinations, but in the end, I usually knew where they stood on an issue and
                    could discuss differences openly and directly. Of course, I ran into the usual
                    human problem of people maneuvering for certain assignments; this was
                    particularly true on the civilian side in OSD. On the military side, in fact, I
                    think I did more lobbying to get certain people assigned than people lobbied me.
                    I had a vacancy in my office - director of East Asian region - which had always
                    been filled by a naval officer. General Jones, then the Chief of Staff, talked
                    to me about that job and persuaded me - unfortunately - to take an Air Force
                    brigadier general. That assignment was not a great success and I wished I had
                    stuck to the naval officer precedent. One of my real recruitment successes was
                    Bill Crowe, who was my deputy in ISA for two years and did a superb job. A
                    number of us called on the CNO to urge Crowe be given a naval command, which he
                    did get and his career zoomed..</p>
                <p>In my assignment as Richardson's aide on personnel I was lobbied frequently
                    during that period by people maneuvering for a specific assignment. These jobs
                    were mostly below the assistant secretary level and really out of my area of
                    jurisdiction. I was viewed as an “influential” person when it came to personnel
                    assignments - mostly civilian jobs. I wasn't necessarily successful, but it
                    helped to widen my circle of acquaintances in the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>The “lobbying” continued even when I was in CINCPAC and in ISA. But the issues
                    were essentially substantive and not personnel related. I was in DoD, including
                    CINCPAC, for five and half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, while working for Richardson, encounter the issue
                        of assigning military officers to civilian positions, as seems to be the
                        modus operandi of the Bush II administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I personally did not encounter much interest in assigning uniformed
                    personnel, either on active duty or retired, to normally civilian jobs. This was
                    true even in the intelligence responsibilities of DoD. We had at the time an
                    assistant secretary for intelligence who was always a civilian. The use of
                    retired military officers in what had been civilian positions started, I
                    believe, mostly with the Reagan administration. Of course, over a period of
                    time, new jobs were added to the Pentagon roster which were often filled by
                    active duty or retired military officers. For example, while I was in the
                    Pentagon, we had no undersecretary for policy or other jobs above the assistant
                    secretary level in OSD. Those jobs were created in the Reagan
                    administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>As I said before, Richardson was a very fine man who reached out to people,
                    sought their input and was obviously and sincerely interested in them. He
                    generated a collegiate atmosphere. His brief stewardship was a healthy one for
                    both the civilian and military staffs of the Pentagon. I thought that perhaps he
                    went “overboard” in trying to reach to certain senior military officers; I
                    didn't think a few of them deserved his attention. But he tended to like
                    everybody or at least treated all well. I attended Richardson's staff meetings
                    and found him always attentive and deeply engaged with the military leaders. He
                    tried hard to make the military feel part of the “team.” These meetings, which I
                    think took place twice a week included the service secretaries, the Joint Chiefs
                    and other senior leaders of DoD. The participants in DoD, by and large, were
                    quite forthcoming and provided information and insights freely and without
                    reservations. Perhaps that is the result of the different nature of many of the
                    issues that faced the Pentagon and State. DoD had major issues dealing with
                    weapon systems, troop deployments, etc. - issues which were far more precise
                    than the policy dilemmas often facing State. I found in general, the SecDef's
                    staff meetings were more productive than SecState's ones.</p>
                <p>By sheer accident the Political Advisor to the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific
                    Command (POLAD-CINCPAC) job came open. There were a number of candidates, but
                    the job seemed attractive that I used whatever influence I could muster, such as
                    with SecDef to get the job. I had the necessary interview with Admiral Gayler
                    and he subsequently offered me the job, which was a State Department billet. It
                    was a very desirable assignment at that point with lots of senior FSO's vying
                    for it. It was until then always filled by an FSO-1 - the highest level in grade
                    levels existing at the time. I was only an FSO-3 but got the job.</p>
                <p>It was, I felt, an important job because CINCPAC was deeply involved in the
                    tensions on the Korean peninsula, and in numerous other Far East issues, less so
                    in Vietnam. In the early 1970's CINCPAC was an important player in the policy
                    process - much more than I believe is today. When he traveled to foreign
                    countries, he could see any foreign official he wanted. He was a major official
                    representing the U.S. That is less true today. The 1970's were the “hay-days”
                    for CINCPAC. That is of course one reason the POLAD job was so attractive.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>In any case, that POLAD job was the best I could find in State or DoD for which I
                    could be a candidate. I am sure I antagonized some more senior FSO's who looked
                    on me as a junior intruder. I think that Schlesinger put in a good word for me
                    with Admiral Gayler and eventually I was appointed as POLAD-CINCPAC with State
                    bowing to Gayler's wishes. Fortunately, all worked out well. I liked working for
                    Gayler and he relied on me to a great extent. I was useful to him because by
                    this time, I had worked up a large network of contacts in the Pentagon. I knew
                    all the civilian and military movers and shakers. Since CINCPAC effectiveness
                    depended to a considerable extent on his ability to get the DoD bureaucracy to
                    support him and to take appropriate actions to promote his programs and
                    activities, I was of real assistance. I was also a good intelligence agent. All
                    that is not normally a POLAD's job, but I was picked for the job in part because
                    of my Pentagon connections. Gayler would send me back to Washington at times to
                    try to resolve a problem that had arisen between the Pentagon and CINCPAC. These
                    issues usually related to our relations with Korea or Japan.</p>
                <p>In the CINCPAC's pecking order, the POLAD was the third ranking office - even
                    though I was much more junior than the grade of the job. That also gave me
                    considerable access. The standard role of a POLAD is to provide the CINC advice
                    and recommendations concerning the political aspects of the command's
                    undertakings. That included host country problems for our military of the impact
                    of U.S. forces on specific Far East countries, both those which hosted U.S.
                    military elements and those who watched U.S. activities in the Pacific area,
                    those in effect and those which were just being planned. As POLAD, I went with
                    the CINC on all his visits to other countries, which often elicited my
                    suggestions on the problems that would arise during these trips and how to
                    handle them. I was also the liaison to the Department of State, which had real
                    interest in the admiral's activities. I also did a lot of liaison work for the
                    admiral, particularly with the OSD (office of the secretary of defense).</p>
                <p>There might have been some who resented my relationships with OSD, but they
                    pretty much kept their resentment to themselves. I had established something of
                    a reputation and people knew that I had many good contacts who would be helpful
                    to me and my boss. I had access to almost all of the Pentagon's leadership.
                    Gayler understood that and used me it. I also had good access in State, although
                    not with William Rogers, then the secretary - whom I didn't particularly want to
                    see anyway and vice-versa. My access in State was good enough to get done what
                    needed to be accomplished.</p>
                <p>My POLAD staff consisted of a deputy (an FSO) and two secretaries. I had as much
                    access to the Admiral as anyone on the CINC staff. He really used me as a
                    sounding board, tossing out ideas and getting my reactions. That relationship
                    acquainted me with issues that went far beyond the POLAD's charter. This was
                    also the first time I got to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The Cambodian situation was deteriorating rapidly. We worked hard on the issue of
                    keeping the Mekong River open for our traffic. I did not contribute much except
                    to comment on political aspects, if any, of any military operation, but I did
                    learn a lot about such efforts. Gayler had some, not great influence, on the
                    conduct of the war in Vietnam and Cambodia. He was the titular head of our armed
                    forces in the Far East. He was probably more influential on Cambodia than he was
                    on Vietnam; on Vietnam issues, General Abrams called the shots.</p>
                <p>In Korea, there were great tensions between Admiral Gayler and General Stilwell.
                    The latter disliked Gayler. He didn't believe that a naval officer had much to
                    contribute to what would be mostly a land-war. He also trumpeted the fact that
                    he was a U.N. commander and not solely a U.S. representative. One of my tasks
                    was to try to ameliorate this tension. I worked with Ambassador Dick Sneider,
                    who also was not on Stilwell's “favorite peoples” list. But Dick and I conspired
                    to find some way to maneuver to keep the peace and get some useful work
                    done.</p>
                <p>The major issue in the Korea peninsula was in some ways a personal one between
                    the two U.S. military leaders. Their antipathy was evident when we went to work
                    on a new war plan for Korea. The new plan added a massive use of firepower -
                    both ground and aito try to destroy the North Koreans in the first few days of
                    any conflict. This approach was a major addition to the existing war plan. It
                    was not a plan that assumed that a new war would be like the old one with its
                    slow but sure move south by the North Korean troops. The new plan was to take
                    advantage of allied fire power superiority. Throughout the discussions of this
                    new approach, there were real tensions. Eventually, both commanders agreed on
                    the plan, but it was rough road. According to standard DoD rules, it was
                    CINCPAC's responsibility to plan for war contingencies. That means that every
                    American war plan in the Far East had to be approved by CINCPAC before it could
                    be forwarded to DoD for final approval. That was a bitter pill for Stilwell to
                    swallow; he preferred to deal directly with Washington and often used his U.N.
                    hat to do so.</p>
                <p>Japan also loomed large on our “client” list. We visited Japan frequently, often
                    in connection with a trip to Korea. Our main objective in Japan was to try to
                    convince the Japanese to increase their military capabilities and to minimize,
                    if not entirely eliminate, the ever recurring politically sensitive issues
                    arising from our bases. I was among the first U.S officials to push for Japanese
                    assumption of our base costs. This was a multi-year push which finally came to a
                    successful culmination during my tour in ISA after CINCPAC.</p>
                <p>We held an annual meeting between American and Japanese leaders. CINCPAC was one
                    of the designated participants. I didn't go to the meetings but I would go to
                    Japan with the CINC which gave me the opportunity to sort of rub elbows with
                    principal staffers.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>In my year at CINCPAC, the two major issues I got deeply involved in were the
                    base issues in Japan and the defense of South Korea. In general, we pushed hard,
                    as I said, for increases in Japanese military capability and for a continuation
                    and strengthening of U.S.-Japan military relationships. In the mid 1970's,
                    unlike today, the U.S.-Japan alliance was not taken for granted. There was still
                    a huge animosity against our policies. Americans disliked Japanese pacifism.
                    Today, few question the need or the desirability of a U.S.-Japan alliance. But
                    in 1970's, there were many issues, large and small, which were aggravating and
                    often raised by the Japanese left just to “keep the pot boiling.” These issues
                    like noise pollution managed to keep the tension levels at times between the two
                    countries at a high level. We spent considerable time massaging our relations
                    with Japan, dampening down the tensions rising from these incidents and at the
                    same time encouraging the Japanese to increase their defense capabilities.</p>
                <p>We spent a lot of time on the Philippines because of our bases there. That is
                    when I first met Ferdinand Marcos. We also visited Thailand frequently because
                    our bases there were instrumental in fighting the war in Indochina. I remember
                    vividly in 1974 when we visited Thailand at the same time as the student
                    uprising. Ambassador Len Unger was hosting a large party for the CINCPAC
                    delegation, to which all of the Thai “brass” and civilian leadership had been
                    invited. We arrived, but none of the Thai guests did. The student uprising had
                    in fact started that evening and led to the overthrow of the military leaders.
                    They fled to Singapore that evening. It was particularly fascinating to me
                    because I wandered around looking at the demonstrations more or less unhindered.
                    The students were by and large proceeding freely and were not harassed. The
                    police were mostly gone. They overthrew the military leadership with great
                    enthusiasm. That was my second experience in Thailand, and the vitality and joy
                    of the students was impressive.</p>
                <p>In Cambodia, CINCPAC did have a particular mission toward the end of the war to
                    keep the Mekong River open for supplying Phnom Penh. The country was going
                    downhill in a hurry - economically and politically. In December, 1974 it was
                    deeply depressing watching the chief of the Cambodian Navy - with his ten or
                    twelve small boats - trying to keep the Mekong open. He told us he would never
                    leave his country under any circumstance. He and others were sure that the U.S.
                    would come to their rescue. It never happened. Cambodia soon fell to the Khmer
                    Rouge. He was hanged, I am told, the day after the city was captured.</p>
                <p>In the early 1970s we knew very little about the Khmer Rouge. Our intelligence
                    was lousy. I had access to most if not all of the intelligence available to the
                    CINC. There may well have been some military intelligence that was given to
                    Gayler privately, but I tried to do my best to see all that State had. CIA was
                    not as major a player in Cambodia, but the station chief in Hawaii was helpful
                    in getting some information. We didn't know for sure if there was a man by the
                    name of Pol Pot; if he did exist, use other names? The whole Cambodian scene was
                    confusing. By the time I arrived as POLAD the situation in Cambodia was clearly
                    going downhill.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I was most interested in embassy NO-DIS traffic; usually the most important for
                    policy purposes and very helpful to the CINC's planning operation. I think that
                    most NO-DIS messages had CINCPAC/POLAD on distribution; on occasions, a message
                    would not make any sense because it referred to a previous one which we might
                    not have received. I would then get on the phone to find the message that we had
                    not received.</p>
                <p>I think I spent six months of the year I was there traveling with the admiral. I
                    had the opportunity to meet all the “movers and shakers” in much of East Asia.
                    These contacts stood me in good stead for almost twenty years. Even after
                    leaving my POLAD job, I could see most of them. The fact that there were so many
                    doors open to me became quite important in my next job as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for East Asia in DoD-ISA. Those relationships built up were
                    invaluable. The only one still active is Lee Kuan Yew and I have not seen him
                    since 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a generic questions about POLADs. Are they
                        a useful adjunct to a military command?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I thought I was. If a POLAD is accepted by the CINC, he or she is
                    useful in injecting a new or different perspective on many very important
                    issues. I could easily insert myself. I think in general POLADs serve as a
                    useful bridge between DoD and State. In my case, I also served as a bridge
                    between the CINC and DoD, but that was probably a unique situation. Certainly,
                    any POLAD can facilitate communications between the CINC and State and between
                    State and DoD. The opportunity to inject State views on issues confronting the
                    CINC can also be very helpful; a good POLAD can effectively reduce the
                    bureaucratic tensions between State and DoD and State and the CINC. It is
                    helpful when all participants in the decision-making process understand the
                    views of all concerned.</p>
                <p>State was quite supportive. I worked primarily with the East Asia bureau and with
                    the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, which was my nominal “home base.” I was
                    in Hawaii for one year from August 1973 to 1974. The Vietnam War was ending. The
                    initial peace agreement had been reached in 1972 and there were intermittent
                    negotiations subsequently. I think we had a pretty good grasp of what was going
                    on in Vietnam. It was essential that CINCPAC be up-to-date if only because it
                    was indispensable if withdrawal was required. In reality by 1973 CINCPAC was not
                    a big player on Vietnam. Between what we were getting from DoD and from State,
                    the CINC was kept quite knowledgeable.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I liked the POLAD job, but did not want to stay too long. I was an adjunct. I
                    thought I contributed to the effectiveness of CINCPAC. I had a very close
                    relationship with Admiral Gayler and made many friends both in the American
                    military and among foreign leaders. What I experienced proved enormously helpful
                    in future assignments. I became will acquainted with the American military which
                    I respect, by and large. They have good ethical standards; most are highly
                    dedicated, on the whole they tend to be more conservative than I am, but, as I
                    have said before, they rarely left you in doubt on where they stand. Because of
                    their attitude, I generally - not always - trusted senior military. I might have
                    questioned their logic or positions at times. The views were occasionally
                    distorted by the number of stripes or stars one wore on his uniform. Senior
                    officers tended to talk about their troops and equipment as “mine”; it is easy
                    to skew perspective when you are saluted all the time. I felt that I established
                    in general a good rapport with a generation of senior officers.</p>
                <p>I can only remember one time when due to my rigidity and stupidity, I managed to
                    anger a senior military officer. This happened in Thailand, during my tour as
                    ambassador when the embassy was going through one of the government's periodic
                    reductions-in-force. The embassy team was quite large and I was instructed to
                    cut it. I also thought I could improve its effectiveness with fewer people. I
                    didn't fight my instructions from Washington and went through the staffing of
                    every section of the embassy. I came to the conclusion that both CIA and the
                    Defense Attach�'s offices could well stand some pruning. For example, we had two
                    naval attach�s to worry about the Thai Navy which was hardly an imposing or
                    important force. Of course, the military assistance office also had a naval
                    component. I thought that the naval presence was overstated and recommended that
                    one of the naval attach�'s positions be eliminated. CINCPAC was extraordinarily
                    unhappy with my view and gave me a lengthy paper on why I was wrong. At the end,
                    the CINC (Admiral Mickey Weisner) called me and asked that I do him a personal
                    favor and withdraw my recommendation. In a moment of insanity, I rejected his
                    CINC's plea; I was dumb. I should have kept the position in light of the CINC's
                    personal intervention. But I stood on “principle”; it was a bad error. I made a
                    permanent enemy of the CINC who went on to be CNO (Chief of Naval Operations).
                    He never forgot or forgave. It was a bad decision on my part for no important
                    matter.</p>
                <p>In Thailand, we spent a considerable amount of time “holding hands.” It was one
                    of our principal duties. The United States loomed large in South-East Asia at
                    the time, the 800 pound gorilla in the room. We had a huge military presence in
                    the region and got involved in all sorts of issues. So we had to spend a lot of
                    time soothing the leadership of these countries - “hand holding”. Thailand and
                    Australia were major targets of our efforts. The Australians were important
                    contributors to our Vietnam War efforts. In addition, Australia was our favorite
                    R&amp;R country. We were on our best behavior when we visited Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What conclusions did you reach about military-to-military
                        relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I don't think I would generalize. But this was a military dominated
                    period. The relationships varied from situation to situation. In some countries,
                    that relationship was particularly important and usually close because the
                    indigenous military were in control of the country - e.g., Indonesia, Thailand,
                    Korea, Taiwan. In those cases, every effort was made to maintain their strong
                    support; we worked hard to gain their confidence and to show our support for
                    their concerns. In those cases, the military-to-military relations were very
                    close, perhaps too close. But we were at war and we had important programs and
                    projects in most of those countries. Whether our support benefited the host
                    country is another issue. We were not unmindful of the possible negative effect
                    that our programs might have on political development of the host country, but
                    our main task was our national military objectives. By and large, as a general
                    observation, I think the military-to-military relationships were probably better
                    than the diplomatic relationships as long as we maintained our commitments to
                    the foreign country, which in all cases consisted in great part of delivery of
                    military hardware. We were important both because we could deliver these goods
                    and because we were a barrier against Chinese and Russian efforts in the region.
                    We were obviously not on the same political philosophy wave length with the
                    military leadership in many countries; it was a “marriage of convenience” based
                    on our mutual interest in maintaining the independence of these countries and in
                    preventing Soviet and Chinese encroachment.</p>
                <p>Relationships were more difficult with the civilian leadership in these countries
                    because they were politicians and the U.S. was not always publicly liked. They
                    had to please multiple audiences and deal with numerous projects not liked by
                    the civilian community. In such countries our presence was often a more
                    difficult problem militarily. Fortunately, the Japanese government, for example,
                    always seemed to find some solution to meet its domestic political requirements
                    and our military operational needs. This is just one example of an issue which,
                    although stemming from a stated military requirement, moved to the political
                    arena.</p>
                <p>In the period we are discussing, and in light of the leadership in most of
                    South-East Asia, our military were often more important than our civilian
                    representation. There was a professional kinship among military irrespective of
                    national uniform. Secondly, our military had much-sought-after hardware to give
                    or sell to the foreign military. Thirdly, and quite importantly, there was
                    probably a greater degree of candor and openness among the military, even if in
                    different uniforms. For these reasons CINCPAC was an important part of American
                    foreign policy in the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I summarized my experiences in the Far East through my POLAD assignment in the
                    paper I delivered at Harvard in 2006, I said: “In the fifties and sixties our
                    alliances were in place and the biggest focus for me was America's role as
                    nation builder to use a contemporary term: to establish states that could be
                    self-sustaining, contribute to their own defense, and resist communism. Included
                    were Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, and the
                    states of Indochina. In Taiwan and a little in Korea I was most involved in the
                    heavy aid emphasis; building physical infrastructure, providing commodity
                    imports to offset large domestic expenditures, vast military assistance
                    programs, encouragement of the private sector, and more effective public
                    administration. AID (then ICA) counted for something and the U.S. year after
                    year, put impressive amounts of money and capable people to the task of helping
                    build those states. Unlike today we had in most countries few internal security
                    worries, and while the foreign publics were envious of our power and wealth,
                    they were grateful for our presence and for the military protection. Our efforts
                    benefited enormously from having superb economic officials in most countries I
                    worked on, often American PhDs in most of the arena, and their cultures honored
                    hard work.</p>
                <p>“We danced with dictators - from Marshall Sarit in Thailand to Pak Chung Hee in
                    South Korea. Our demarches were quiet and democracy promotion was a more
                    peripheral consideratiocertainly not preached with today's emphasis. As the U.S.
                    moved toward militarily involvement in Vietnam, we increasingly emphasized
                    political stability and each country's support for the war. For example, we
                    wanted sizeable South Korean forces for Vietnam, and this consideration
                    dominated our attitude toward military control of the South. While governments
                    were not always stable - indeed incessant military coups occurred in Thailand,
                    continuing when I was ambassador in 1980 and even to my surprise till today -
                    the systems, except for Indochina, changed little, and officialdom was permeated
                    with a strong anti-communism animus, which added determination to their efforts.
                    Finally corruption permeated almost all of these countries, but it did not
                    prevent rapid development so often asserted for today's less developed
                    countries. One last politically incorrect, perhaps erroneous reflection: today
                    Taiwan and South Korea are vibrant democracies, causing American governments no
                    little pain, but I doubt that these countries would have prospered so quickly
                    under democratic governments. Chiang Ching-kuo and Pak rank high in the pantheon
                    of economic developers.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Before closing this chapter of my career, I should elaborate on an incident I
                    previously mentioned but have never forgotten. I had accompanied Admiral Gayler
                    in the late autumn of 1974 to Cambodia - my first visit. He wanted to find ways
                    to keep the Mekong River open; and supplies reaching Phnom Penh. We spent three
                    days in Cambodia. The issue was essentially a military one, but I went along. I
                    accompanied Gayler when he met with the chief of the Cambodian navy, Admiral
                    Vong Sarendy. After lunch, he and I walked along the river and got into a
                    discussion on the future of Cambodia. He said that there would be more warfare,
                    that his country was in mortal danger, but even if his country fell he was
                    prepared to die in its defense. He believed his life depended on preventing the
                    Khmer Rouge from taking Phnom Penh. It was the kind of conversation that grabs
                    one's attention and arouses much anguish. I expected that we would eventually
                    stop our support of Cambodia; I didn't say so, but I was hearing at least one
                    voice who we might well abandon and I never forgot that conversation. He was
                    hanged immediately after the Khmer Rouge took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have some reservation about us withdrawing from
                        South East Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Sure, but I knew it was over. We were facing a situation which was
                    bound to end in many tragedies. Our withdrawal could not have a happy ending.
                    The American people were withdrawing their support of our policy; Vietnam was
                    collapsing; Cambodia was a true mess. I became involved in South East Asia when
                    our position there was badly deteriorating. I watched both from CINCPAC and my
                    subsequent assignment in DoD the end of a decade of war for the U.S. The
                    question that was always posed for me was whether the deterioration could be
                    somehow arrested. Ultimately, we ran out of political options. That became
                    depressingly clear to me when I accompanied Deputy Secretary Bill Clements to
                    Saigon in December, 1974. At that time, he assured President Thieu that we were
                    prepared to provide all the funds and tools he needed to keep his country's
                    independence. It wasn't that easy and Clements knew it. I could understand why
                    the deputy secretary took that line; he could not tell him the truth. At this
                    time, I am not sure the consensus of the U.S. staff working in and on Vietnam
                    was that the war was lost; I thought so in December, but I may well have been a
                    minority at that time. Secretary Schlesinger, by the end of 1974, was deeply
                    concerned that the war was being lost, but I am not sure he had yet reached my
                    conclusion. Clements was probably more positive. In any case, the deputy
                    secretary could not deliver such bad news. The government could have fallen even
                    quicker. We talked briefly about it after his meeting with Thieu. He was not
                    about to further undermine the morale of the Vietnam government</p>

                        about?</hi>

                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The offer came out of the blue and I was surprised. I was in Honolulu
                    and expected to finish a two year tour as POLAD. But I must say that after one
                    year, I felt I had pretty well grasped the major issues and had met most if not
                    all of the important players in the region, and felt the need for greater
                    responsibility. Secretary Schlesinger, who knew me to some extent, called in
                    July, 1974 and told me that Dennis Dooker was leaving the deputy assistant
                    secretary job and he wanted me to take over. It didn't take me long to agree;
                    like immediately. I was delighted. Schlesinger was familiar with my book on
                    China; I saw him once or twice when I accompanied the CINC back to Washington
                    and I had met him on another couple of occasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about ISA's organizational
                        structure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: ISA at that time was basically the foreign policy and defense center
                    in the office of the secretary of defense. It was organized regionally plus the
                    military assistance. Most of the daily interagency exchanges on foreign issues,
                    including intelligence matters, and all relationships with foreign countries
                    went through ISA. There were of course interchanges between Pentagon officials,
                    civilian and military, with foreign officials, but these contacts were limited
                    and some were vetted by ISA. I focused on broad issues of policy and strategy. I
                    was particularly interested in pursuing how to maximize our security interests
                    and those of our East Asia allies in the post-Vietnam era.</p>
                <p>One of my earliest efforts to get a better feel for issues of national security
                    in East Asia was to convene a standing Defense study group to look at our
                    strategy there. The results of our efforts were provided from time to time to
                    other U.S. agencies.</p>
                <p>The first issue I had to confront after assuming the DAS job was, of course,
                    Vietnam. By then the situation was pretty grim. While first and foremost a
                    military matter, ISA had many interests of its own in the whole issue besides
                    military ones. We were concerned about the accuracy of the reporting from
                    Saigon. This was a question both of coverage and understanding. Were the reports
                    from Saigon providing sufficient coverage of what was going in South Vietnam or
                    was it skewed by perceptions developed Saigon? Was it candid and a decent
                    reflection of reality? I sent a number of my staff to South Vietnam to quietly
                    examine the situation and get a broad range view of what was going on. I did not
                    have a particular policy bent, but I did think that it was important for
                    decision-makers to have as good and as objective view of the situation as
                    possible. I had full confidence that the people I sent provided their candid
                    views of the scene as best they could. I had of course had been aware of the
                    Vietnam situation when I was the POLAD in Hawaii, but my duties were more those
                    of an advisor; in ISA, I had operational responsibilities toward the Secretary
                    which required me to be as knowledgeable as possible about the Vietnam
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>In ISA, I had some fortuitous circumstances, which prevailed with all three
                    secretaries I worked for - Schlesinger, Rumsfeld and Harold Brown. My immediate
                    boss, the ISA assistant secretary, allowed me to pursue a personal relationship
                    with each secretary. I did not have to go through the assistant secretary to
                    meet with the secretary. That lasted through three assistant secretaries - Gene
                    McAuliff, Bob Ellsworth and David McGiffert. I talked to the secretary
                    frequently, but I always immediately kept the assistant secretary fully informed
                    of conversations and of any work generated by these exchanges. I didn't leave my
                    boss in the dark. I didn't always forewarn them of upcoming issues; I couldn't
                    because I never knew when the secretary might want to talk to me. But I did make
                    sure that after any conversation, the assistant secretary was briefed in some
                    detail. It was for me an excellent arrangement; I don't recall what arrangements
                    my other DAS colleagues had, but it made life much easier for me. In part, I
                    think the assistant secretaries allowed me that freedom because none of them had
                    any particular background or perhaps even great interest in Asia. They were
                    Euro-centric in the main.</p>
                <p>I had 25-30 people working for me - half civilian and half military. My first
                    deputy was a rear admiral, Tom Bagley, a fine officer who greatly helped me
                    settle in to my new job. His successor was Bill Crowe, who was the closest
                    officer I worked with. Working directly for Crowe was a team of eight or nine
                    people concentrating on Vietnam. That team, mostly military officers, was quite
                    good; they had good contacts throughout the building, obviously in the JCS. I
                    myself worked hard to establish a relationship with all the service chiefs as
                    well as the senior officers working on J-3 and directly for the chairman. Many
                    of our conversations focused on broader questions dealing with our position in
                    East Asia, what we could do to bolster it, the military assistance programs,
                    etc. In the DoD bureaucracy, military assistance was the responsibility of ISA.
                    One of the largest sections of ISA was the Defense Security Assistance Agency
                    (DSAA).</p>
                <p>As for military assistance it was at times and in some countries the coin of the
                    realm. It was vital for countries like South Korea and almost everywhere in the
                    Pacific made life politically easier or much harder in its absence.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>One of our joint (ISA/EA and DSAA) efforts in Vietnam was to gather a team (of
                    which Rich Armitage, later deputy secretary of state, was a member) which was
                    charged with rescuing from Vietnam as much military equipment as it could, to
                    keep it out of the hands of the North Vietnamese. Armitage had been a Navy Seal
                    and was instrumental in removing a lot of naval equipment, including ships, from
                    South Vietnam. Most of it was consigned to the junk heap. Some of the last acts
                    of members of this team concerned the evacuation of both Americans and
                    Vietnamese from Saigon. The key was to find sufficient number of helicopters
                    which was a very serious challenge. Ambassador Graham Martin, to his credit,
                    wanted to evacuate as many Vietnamese as he could get aboard. He just wanted the
                    helicopters to keep coming; he tried to delay the final departure, but we were
                    not able, in the end, to meet his desires. Schlesinger had to finally put an end
                    to the evacuation, leaving behind undoubtedly a number of deserving South
                    Vietnamese. Time just ran out, and the last days were nerve-wrecking with the
                    Viet Cong at the outskirts of Saigon and during the evacuation helicopters
                    arriving later than anticipated. I spent those last days in the MCC (Military
                    Command Center) along with everybody else. It was a dark time.</p>
                <p>I recall another trying moment related to our last days in Cambodia. I remember
                    vividly John Gunther Dean, our ambassador in Phnom Penh, calling me at 4 a.m.
                    begging for help to save the city. He wanted assistance to forestall that
                    outcome. I promised Dean that I would do what I could, but I knew in my own mind
                    that we had reached the end of the road in Cambodia. I knew that Dean would be
                    calling everyone in Washington, both because he did need help badly, he also
                    wanted to make sure that the record clearly reflected the depth of the problem
                    and his last ditch efforts to save the situation; another very dark
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>I did not know Rumsfeld or Brown when they became Secretary of Defense. But I was
                    able to develop the same personal relationship with them that I had had with
                    Schlesinger. The three of them were totally different - incredibly so. I liked
                    working for all three.</p>
                <p>When I first started in ISA, the issue was Vietnam. So my first effort to become
                    educated was to go to Saigon. As a DAS, I was viewed by the military as the
                    equivalent of a three or four star general. Sort of ridiculous in terms of the
                    number of people who worked for me. I was given a plane to travel around the
                    country. I saw most senior Vietnamese and American leaders.. There was one event
                    on that trip I shall never forget. In Saigon, I stayed with Marshall Bremen, our
                    PAO in Saigon. We had taken the Foreign Service entrance examination at the same
                    time and remained close friends ever since. Marshall hosted a party for me which
                    was attended by our ambassador to Vietnam, Graham Martin - a legendary figure at
                    State in his own right. I had first met Martin when I worked for Elliot
                    Richardson. Graham was one of those who “walk the halls” of the Department of
                    State, to get a feel for what was going to get the latest news, and advance
                    whatever cause he had. He was an unusual man, well known for his determination
                    and his deviousness.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>At the party he and I had a furious argument about the situation in Vietnam. He
                    took the opportunity to attack all “doubters,” focusing in on Ted Kennedy.
                    Somehow or other, even though I was working for a Republican president, I found
                    myself defending Kennedy. All the guests were left open-mouthed at the vigor of
                    the argument, particularly since Martin was an ambassador not to be trifled wit.
                    I don't think they had ever seen anyone talk to Martin as I did. The next day, I
                    was at the air base leaving Vietnam, and Martin's assistant came to see me. He
                    had with him the book that I had written with Dick Moorsteen on China. He asked
                    me to autograph the book for the ambassador, which I was glad to do. It was
                    Martin at his best; he was making an overture, although I was at best a small
                    mover or shaker in Washington. But Martin didn't want me to leave Saigon with a
                    bitter taste in my mouth; so he made his “peace overture” so that I wouldn't
                    inject my views based on a personal bias. That was Graham Martin. He also never
                    feared to take unpopular stances.</p>
                <p>I started at ISA in August 1974, just as Nixon was going down. His resignation
                    added to an already over-complicated dangerous foreign policy situation. The
                    American military were in great disarray. The Pentagon, military and civilian,
                    was sinking into deep depression. Many, not all, thought that our days in
                    Vietnam were numbered and that the end would be bitter with far reaching
                    consequences. Morale was at an obvious nadir. Until April, 1975, I spent most of
                    my time working on Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.</p>
                <p>Again, as I said in my lecture at Harvard: “The end of the Ford years and the
                    early Carter years were marked by defeat in Vietnam and the first recession in
                    the overwhelming American dominance in East Asia. It was a difficult period for
                    the U.S. and for me personally at DoD. It was bizarre to be the chief Senate
                    witness for military assistance outlays when communist forces were mounting
                    their final offensive against Saigon; it was terrible to be in the National
                    Military Command Center listening to the evacuation of our Embassy from Saigon
                    and the demands for more helicopters to move (evacuate) those Vietnamese who
                    were close to us; and they were simply not there. It was painful to be called in
                    the middle of the night by our ambassador in Cambodia begging for assistance as
                    the Khmer Rouge approached Phnom Penh. It was disheartening in most of my years
                    in the Pentagon to watch the incredible deterioration of the U.S. army, though
                    that trend began to be reversed in great part by General Abrams and ultimately
                    by the all-volunteer force.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you interact with the NSC process when working on
                        an East Asia issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I was in constant touch with NSC East Asian staffers. I would
                    accompany Schlesinger whenever he attended an NSC system meeting on an East Asia
                    issue. Since Vietnam was in the highest priority category, which meant that I
                    went with the secretary frequently. I would sit in back of him in the Situation
                    Room. The conversation between Schlesinger and Kissinger was usually very
                    spirited and more intellectual than most conversations in general. Not all
                    meetings were at the White House. Toward the end of our involvement, more
                    meetings were focused on refugee issues and post Vietnam issues.</p>
                <p>I had frequent meetings with State Department officials like Marshall Green and
                    Phil Habib who served also as Assistant Secretary. There was much focus on our
                    military assistance program, particularly in an effort to provide the South
                    Vietnamese with as much equipment as we could and similarly with South Korea
                    when we considered removing all our ground forces there. The mood at meetings
                    was very bad, particularly among our military who were completely demoralized by
                    events.</p>
                <p>I would have to add at this point that I thought that the policy process to deal
                    with South East Asian issues was a day-to-day affair, and invariable ad hoc. The
                    sole objective was to keep the war going until a situation was hopefully created
                    which would make the end of our involvement as palatable as possible.
                    Eventually, after a series of battles, the general conclusion came to be that
                    the end was in sight. By “general conclusion”, I refer to the sentiment both of
                    the civilian and the military components of the Pentagon, although there was
                    little tension between these two groups when it came to the issue of ending our
                    engagement in Vietnam. Toward the end of that engagement in April, Schlesinger
                    sent General Fred Wiant to review the whole military picture. The secretary
                    asked for an honest, straightforward report. Wiant told him that the war was
                    over and that there was no chance of the South Vietnamese regaining their lost
                    territory. After that analysis, our attention turned to evacuation efforts, both
                    of our military and civilian presence as well as those for those South
                    Vietnamese that had been helpful to us.</p>
                <p>For me, this period was the last hurrah. No further military assistance could be
                    expected to turn the tide. I am telling you now some of what I remember of those
                    days, but without any documentation in front of me, I can't vouch for the
                    accuracy of my recollections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the first few months of your tour in ISA were devoted
                        to South East Asia. That ended around April, 1975. Then what did you focus
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Before I could move on, in May, 1975, we had to confront the USS
                    Mayaguez incident. The ship was captured off the coast of Cambodia. We were not
                    certain for a period of time of what was going on and worked furiously to try to
                    find out to where the ship and crew had been taken. I had to testify on what we
                    knew and I was DoD's lead witness on this issue for much of the episode. In a
                    later session, I testified along with Phil Habib, then State's EA assistant
                    secretary. These sessions were primarily for briefing purposes to share with the
                    committees what we knew, which was precious little at the beginning, and what
                    our plans were. There was general agreement in Washington that we had to get the
                    ship and its crew back. Unfortunately, as I recall, our military were having
                    difficulty getting its operational act together. So a number of us took the
                    issue directly to the secretary and then we worked directly with the White
                    House.</p>
                <p>We agreed on a rescue mission, during which, as you may recall, one of our large
                    helicopters crashed for mechanical reasons with the ensuing loss of some 53
                    lives. The rescue operation lasted for several days and eventually managed to
                    free the ship and crew. The effort was belittled by a lot of observers, but it
                    worked. There is a famous picture of an elated Ford, Scowcroft and Rumsfeld in
                    the Oval Office when the USS Mayaguez was released; it was a victory for our
                    side which badly needed some good news.</p>
                <p>The Mayaguez affair had one real benefit. It vastly improved the mood and morale
                    of the Department of Defense. Obtaining the release of the Mayaguez, however
                    small, was the first positive step that the U.S. military had taken for a long
                    time. I don't want to over-stress this aspect, there was a sigh of relief in the
                    Pentagon. We had won one.</p>
                <p>What followed the Vietnam War was the successful effort to create an
                    all-volunteer army, a turning point for our military, and for the nation. The
                    move from a draft to an all-volunteer force, which enabled General Abrams to
                    turn a highly demoralized army into one that has performed outstandingly since
                    the early 1980s. This revitalization had another interesting result; whereas
                    soldiers returning from Vietnam were treated shabbily by their countrymen and
                    the military institution was viewed with disdain by the American public, those
                    who today return from Iraq and Afghanistan are greeted with open arms and the
                    military has a high standing in the American public. Today, every politician
                    praises the military, even while most condemn the war. During Vietnam, both the
                    war and the military were “bad.” The all volunteer force has also permitted us
                    to fight for some seven years. That wound not have been possible if a draft
                    still existed.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>As the Vietnam War was coming to a conclusion, my focus shifted to the issue of
                    how to preserve American influence in East Asia. What should be our posture in
                    the post-Vietnam era? What role would the Chinese military now play in the
                    region, not only as a result of our withdrawal from Vietnam, but also in light
                    of the Sino-Soviet split. How should we react to China? How do we better
                    preserve the peace in Korea? These were probably the core East Asia issues that
                    the administration focused in its last year. Our attention to East Asia was
                    heightened by Sam Nunn's legislative efforts to reduce our military presence and
                    bases in the area. Secretaries Schlesinger and Rumsfeld thought that Nunn's
                    initiative was the wrong approach. I certainly shared their negativism. I
                    thought the failure in Vietnam called for the maintenance of a strong military
                    presence in the area; it was not - so soon after Vietnam - to further diminish
                    our posture in East Asia. We were concerned that our failure would embolden
                    communist efforts in Southeast Asia and we needed to show our strength and
                    dedication to our allies.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to develop a response to Nunn's efforts. I took the position that
                    in the interest of preserving our position in Asia (and most of our facilities),
                    we had to make some offer to reduce our presence somewhere in the area. In
                    1975-76, we undertook a major base structure study that was requested by Nunn.
                    At the end, we made only minor changes, which satisfied the “withdrawal crowd”
                    without damaging our military posture. My view was that we should continue to
                    maintain robust forces in Thailand, Japan, Korea, Okinawa and the Philippines.
                    As I said, we made some minor adjustments in our total presence as well as
                    closing or reducing some bases. This gesture satisfied our immediate political
                    requirements, both domestic and foreign, and permitted us to preserve our
                    essential base structure.</p>
                <p>My second goal was to try to enhance our military position in South Korea. This
                    was a major issue because influential senators like Sam Nunn were supporting a
                    withdrawal strategy or a minimum realignment policy. Nunn, whom I became
                    friendly with, wanted to move the 2nd Division away from the DMZ to the south
                    where it would not be so exposed to a North Korean attack. We thought that was
                    really bizarre and significantly reduced deterrence. We resisted his views with
                    vigor. We felt that our alliances in East Asia had been negatively impacted by
                    our retreat from Vietnam and that any additional diminution in our position with
                    our allies - particularly Japan and South Korea - would further reduce their
                    confidence in the United States and our influence. Our prestige had already
                    taken a major hit; we strongly believed that any further actions would be
                    negatively perceived and would not be in our interest. Most Asian nations deeply
                    feared further American retreat. As a general goal, we not only wanted to
                    maintain our alliances, but strengthen them where we could. We were concerned
                    that any perceived weakening of American resolve might be used by some East
                    Asian governments as an excuse to accept possible communist encroachment into
                    the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Our concern for the potential of communist encroachment in East Asia, gave me the
                    opportunity in 1975after Vietnam fell to convene a group to come up with a U.S.
                    strategy for Asia in the post Vietnam era. Our major recommendation actually was
                    to slowly improve our relationships with China including development of a
                    military-to-military relationship. When the study was completed we briefed other
                    agencies in Washington. I think it was well received. It was not a roadmap, but
                    more of a strategy piece intended to begin creation of a framework for
                    inter-agency discussions about what specific steps might be taken to improve our
                    position in Asia. We needed to explore what more could be done to strengthen our
                    relations with China, as part of our effort to contain the Soviet Union in Asia.
                    In any case, our views were heard around town; I don't know how much influence
                    we had, but I think it gave some help to those pressing for an easing of
                    tensions with the PRC.</p>
                <p>It also widely felt that Sino-Soviet tensions might ease if the Chinese came to
                    believe that we were not a reliable player in the region. This view carried over
                    into the Carter administration where it was challenged by some members of that
                    administration. In any case, much of my time in 1975 was devoted to trying to
                    restore East Asian views of the United States as a reliable and dependable
                    ally.</p>
                <p>I remember appearing on the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour” - it was my first,
                    appearance on that program - with Ed Reischauer and someone else. I was the lone
                    defender of maintaining ground forces in Korea.</p>
                <p>In 1976, we had to deal with another major incident on the Korean Peninsula: the
                    famous - infamous - ax murders that took place in the DMZ when a company of
                    North Korean soldiers attacked a U.S. army detachment, which was engaged in
                    pruning the limbs of a tree which had obscured our observers' sight in the zone.
                    They axed to death two of our officers. Rumsfeld was then the secretary of
                    defense following Schlesinger's dismissal in November 1975. General Stillwell,
                    our CINC - and the top UN commander in South Korea - was given responsibility
                    for handling this matter. We did keep an open telephone line from the Pentagon
                    to the command in Korea. Our military cut down the offending tree while North
                    Korean forces watched.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Early in my tenure in ISA, I became involved in the issue of financial
                    compensation by the Japanese for our military bases in their country. I am
                    pleased that we managed to get the Japanese to begin to bear some of the costs
                    of our presence. The Japanese had recovered quite well from the war, at least in
                    economic terms. I felt it was time for them to assist in maintaining our
                    military facilities in Japan, which to a considerable degree where required for
                    Japan's defense as well as Korea's. We negotiated the first labor costs sharing
                    agreement in which the Japanese became responsible for the payment of a
                    significant portion of the local labor costs involved in the management of the
                    bases. The negotiations were actually conducted by our embassy and military
                    establishment in Japan, but we provided the initiative, guidance and
                    back-stopping. Eventually, this small step led to a major Japanese investment in
                    our bases; today the Japanese pay the lion share of the costs. This was a
                    concrete and measurable achievement. Our focus on reaching this agreement was in
                    part stimulated by our interest in showing Congress that we had vibrant allies
                    in East Asia who were willing to share the defense burden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to ask you to clarify your relationship with
                        DSAA (Defense Security Assistance Agency). As the ISA deputy for East Asia
                        and Latin America, did you get involved in military assistance
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Often, since most of my countries were large recipients. There were
                    times when DSAA and the Bureau for Politico-Military Affairs in the State
                    Department would seek my advice or I would simply put my two cents in. My
                    involvement in this program grew considerably during the Carter administration
                    when I was asked to focus on enhancing our military assistance program for Korea
                    to help offset the proposed American troop withdrawal. I led an inter-agency
                    task force on this issue, consisting primarily of the logistic component of JCS,
                    DSAA and the State Department. We produced a report despite the fact all members
                    of the group were opposed to troop withdrawal. In fact, the only person I knew
                    who continuously favored the proposal was President Carter. Our task force
                    proposed a massive military assistance program to South Korea as an offset to
                    U.S. troop withdrawal.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I tried but never succeeded in finding out who helped persuade Carter during the
                    1976 campaign to advocate removing U.S. ground forces from Korea. All suspects
                    resolutely deny it, and I never asked the President, who, of course, may well
                    have decided on his own. I do know that I got tarred with it, in great part
                    because I was the point man for pulling the Defense side together, defending it
                    before a skeptical military, and making the case for withdrawal on the Hill. The
                    Reagan Republicans never forgave me until George Shultz came along. In fact, I
                    was totally against the withdrawal and early on made my opposition known to my
                    new boss at Defense - Harold Brown who had replaced Don Rumsfeld. My first
                    run-in with the new administration on Korea, a month after inauguration, was on
                    a plane to Tokyo with VP Mondale to “consult” with Japan - ot South Korea - on
                    our troop removal. In the briefing session I blurted out to Mondale “You can't
                    do this; we have at least to consult with the Koreans.” Mondale, a wonderful
                    man, smiled and said “You know, Mort, there has been an election in our
                    country.”</p>
                <p>The withdrawal was a campaign promise, and Carter, unlike many other presidents,
                    was determined to carry it out over the strong opposition of the bureaucracy and
                    many senior Democrats including some in the Cabinet. At the first meeting of
                    senior officials to discuss plans for withdrawal, Treasury Secretary Blumenthal,
                    at the end of the meeting, got up and said “Why in hell are we doing this?”</p>
                <p>Korea was a disaster for the President from the start. The White House initially
                    told the departments it wanted all ground forces out in one year and the State
                    Department as good soldiers tried to carry it out. But it produced a large
                    uproar and after much negotiation, we got the withdrawal “back loaded” - a
                    regiment in the first two years and the balance in 1982, after another
                    Presidential election. At Defense, as I mentioned, we came up with a big
                    military assistance program to help improve Korean forces. In the end, Carter
                    abandoned the project supposedly because CIA discovered - rather conveniently -
                    that the intelligence community had badly underestimated the size of North
                    Korean forces by several hundred thousands. The withdrawal effort had one major
                    unintended consequence. It consumed South Korea and undermined President Park
                    politicallhe had lost the all important American mantle - and ultimately, I
                    believe, led to his assassination by his KCIA chief, although personal reasons
                    were also involved.”</p>
                <p>This discussion reminds me of a comment that Jim Schlesinger made when I received
                    an AFSA award. He said: “Mort and I went to Korea during my tour as secretary of
                    defense. We had gotten some intelligence that indicated that the Koreans were
                    working on the development of a nuclear weapon. I was charged with telling
                    President Park Chung Hee that if such a program existed, it better be terminated
                    immediately. And the South Koreans did. Now guess who has nuclear weapons on the
                    peninsula? That was a wry commentary on history.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>In connection with nukes, Schlesinger was the first cabinet officer to warn the
                    South Koreans not to try to build nuclear weapons. The South's efforts were not
                    terminated immediately, but over a period of time. One other episode that I
                    remember from the Schlesinger trip dealt with human rights questions. We were
                    still in the pre-Carter days. We were sitting in Chosun Hotel discussing the
                    issues he would take up with President Park. I suggested that the human rights
                    issue be raised. It was clear that Congress led by Congressman Don Fraser was
                    becoming increasingly restive about the Korean government's repressive tactics
                    against its opponents. Koreagate also was just beginning to percolate; Kim Dae
                    Jung had been kidnaped from Japan and was threatened with a death sentence.
                    Schlesinger was reluctant to take up the issue. He did not in principle at that
                    time believe that the U.S. should pontificate to other governments on their
                    behavior, particularly on issues which were essentially domestic political ones
                    in a still turbulent country. I told him that nevertheless I thought that he had
                    to raise the issue if only for our domestic political reasons. He was still very
                    reluctant. I told him that the first question that would be raised by American
                    reporters at his press conference scheduled after his meeting with Park was
                    going to be about human rights. Then he would either have to say that it was not
                    raised or he would have to lie, neither was palatable. When I made that comment,
                    Schlesinger got annoyed - he did not like to dissimulate - but he raised the
                    issue with Park. The first question at the press conference indeed dealt with
                    human rights. Schlesinger didn't talk to me for three days after that! And he
                    has never forgotten that episode. He has said that the only person who was more
                    to the right of him on pontificating on human rights at that time was Henry
                    Kissinger.</p>
                <p>I felt that the human rights issue had to be raised in part because South Korea's
                    standing in the U.S. was rapid deteriorating. We had to make a showing on it if
                    we were not to seriously jeopardize our ability to maintain our military posture
                    on the peninsula. For a senior American government not to raise the issue could
                    have had serious unintended consequences.</p>
                <p>In the next year Carter was elected and human rights became a central rhetorical
                    focus of U.S. foreign policy. It must have been part of the presidential desire
                    to withdraw our troops from South Korea. We received a directive to start the
                    troop withdrawal planning immediately. From Secretary Harold Brown down, we all
                    thought this was a very poor idea. The first meeting on this issue was chaired
                    by Bill Gleysteen, then the deputy assistant secretary for EA in State - later
                    our ambassador to Korea. He said that we had to draw up plans to get the Army
                    division out of South Korea within a year. I told him that the Pentagon could
                    not go along with such a time-table. We mustered a counter-attack which
                    eventually was successful; the time table was stretched out considerably and as
                    I noted before, the withdrawal was back loaded - that is, much of the combat
                    capabilities would be the last to go (after the end of Carter's four years in
                    office).</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>As word of our intense planning got around, a growing swell of outside opposition
                    emerged. Sam Nunn, a powerful Senator on defense matters, questioned Carter's
                    objective. Hubert Humphrey began to have concerns about the wisdom of
                    withdrawal. When secretaries Vance and Brown appeared before Congressional
                    committees to explain the administration's policy, they ran into lots of
                    opposition. In Brown's case, as I knew, his job as a witness was made harder by
                    the fact that he personally did not agree with Carter's decision. He was not the
                    only one who had that problem. I also had to defend the Carter position on the
                    Hill, even though I didn't agree with it. That was true for other Defense
                    witnesses. It was very awkward. In my case, the fact that I appeared to defend
                    the withdrawal decision made me very unpopular among many military. I remember
                    at one hearing Senator Jesse Helms saying: “Mr. Abramowitz, do you really
                    believe what you are saying?” I ducked the question.</p>
                <p>This withdrawal issue was a major bone of contention in the U.S. government.
                    General Singlaub who was the chief of staff of the U.S. commander in Korea was
                    recalled after being in Korea for only a few months because he publicly opposed
                    Carter's decision. Of course, he was reflecting the views of all the senior
                    military officers in the Pentagon, as well as those of the UN Command in Korea
                    under General Vessey. In the Pentagon, we began a rear guard action - delay it,
                    water it down, mitigate the decision as much as possible. Brown knew what the
                    staff was doing and never interfered. Eventually, over the next year, even State
                    came to oppose the withdrawal. I am sure that many will have somewhat different
                    recollections about the sequence and nature of events, but I think it is fair to
                    say that eventually the bureaucracy came together to oppose the withdrawal
                    decision.</p>
                <p>My main objection to the decision was that it was premature. The stability on the
                    peninsula was still too dependent on our military presence. Human rights did not
                    enter into my calculations. I felt that our withdrawal significantly enhanced
                    the possibility of Northern intervention, particularly coming after our failure
                    in Vietnam. Carter's decision was imprudent. It was clear that we could not
                    reverse it, but we did manage to develop a time frame for withdrawal which made
                    it more acceptable. In the meantime, we could bolster South Korea's defense
                    capability by providing a wide range of modern weaponry. As I said earlier, the
                    withdrawal decision was finally rescinded when CIA's analysis came to the
                    conclusion that the North Korea's military capabilities were far greater than
                    had been thought. I think that perhaps one regiment was withdrawn; that was the
                    total result of Carter's decision - and that was made primarily to save the
                    president's face.</p>
                <p>I don't have any view about CIA's findings. I do believe that such analyses need
                    considerable scrutiny because they are indeed, at best, good guesswork. How many
                    Vietcong were there in South Vietnam? How large were the North Korean forces?
                    These have to be educated guesses; precision can not be the judgement standard.
                    I suspect that CIA's analysis was probably correct that the North's forces were
                    larger than we had anticipated; how much larger I would not vouch for. In any
                    case, the analysis was very useful for the anti-withdrawal forces in Washington.
                    It undermined one of Carter's assumption upon which he based his decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>For me personally, it was no longer a consuming issue because I was preparing to
                    go to Thailand. On the other hand, the whole withdrawal affair became personally
                    damaging because there were people like General Dick Stillwell and others who
                    held me responsible for being the principal architect of the withdrawal
                    decision. I think they misunderstood my role as “public defender” - in
                    Congressional appearances, for example - of the policy; they thought that I
                    personally believed in it. Once I was invited to speak to the Naval War College
                    in Newport, RI, at its annual convocation which always attracted a large
                    military audience. I defended the policy at great length, and I was met, so I
                    surprisingly, with great skepticism by the overwhelming majority of the
                    audience. Stillwell had become personally very antagonistic to me since my
                    service as CINCPAC's Polad; he hated Gayler with a passion. So my Congressional
                    appearances and my Newport speech gave Stillwell plenty of opportunities to
                    poison the Pentagon atmosphere against me, even after I had left for Thailand
                    and notably when the Republicans returned to power.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I was asked in 1981 by Dick Kennedy, the State Department's
                    undersecretary for management, who said Secretary Haig was interested in my
                    becoming the assistant secretary for EA. I said I was very interested, but asked
                    whether the incumbent, John Holdridge, had been informed of the decision to
                    replace him. Kennedy said “No.” So that left it to me to tell John, who was a
                    personal friend. When the word got around, Stillwell and others raised hell and
                    eventually managed to scuttle my nomination. We were now in the Reagan
                    administration and Stillwell had been made as a civilian Undersecretary of
                    Defense for Policy. He not only criticized me for our policy in South Korea, but
                    also for the work I had done on the Philippines bases and other issues. This
                    comment is out-of-time sequence, but I mention it now to illustrate how my
                    position was damaged by the Carter decision to withdraw the combat division for
                    South Korea. I was also undermined by criticisms made by my station chief in
                    Bangkok, Dan Arnold. In 1981, in the first year of the Reagan administration, I
                    was offered three different assignments and all were withdrawn.</p>
                <p>In summary, I think it is fair to say that by and large, the bureaucracy
                    gradually came to oppose President Carter's decision to withdraw the 2nd
                    Division from South Korea. I think NSC advisor Brzezinski supported the
                    decision; his attitude seemed to me that this was a decision that the president
                    had made, it was his responsibility to see it implemented, and he probably did
                    not foresee any catastrophic consequences from it; so he did what he was
                    supposed to do. There were some voices in Congress who supported the decision,
                    but in general I don't think there was much support for troop withdrawal
                    anywhere in Congress or else in the country, except for the academe. The East
                    Asia bureau began as a strong supporter, as did Secretary Vance. But, that
                    enthusiasm at State waned and in the later stages of the drama, State came to
                    share our point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Carter was not unaware of the opposition that was being mounted by the
                    bureaucracy. I assume he was upset and angry. But he never tried to punish those
                    who opposed him except in the case of Singlaub's public attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we finish the discussion on Korea, let me ask you
                        about the Security Consultative Meetings (SCM) that were started when you
                        were in ISA. What was your view on meetings of this kind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I was very positive about having the SCM, particularly the first few
                    meetings because they were crucial to explain to the Koreans our position in
                    Vietnam and the Far East in general. It was very welcome to the Korean
                    Government, it made them feel more like a read ally. We thought it would help
                    resolve some problems in convincing the Koreans that we were not diminishing our
                    interest in their independence and defense despite our withdrawal from Vietnam.
                    We had to convince them that the two issues were not related and that we
                    continued to be their staunch allies to prevent and repel any North Korea
                    intrusion. The SCMs were essentially DoD-ROK Defense Department talks, although
                    State had a representative on our team. The meetings were at Cabinet level and I
                    think they were useful to both sides. We had similar annual meetings with Japan,
                    although in that case, the U.S. participants were CINCPAC and our ambassador to
                    Japan who led the U.S. delegation. The meetings continue to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also favor in the 1970's the annual military
                        exercises that we conducted with the South Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Yes. These were important in making our joint military efforts more
                    effective as well as training the South Koreans. I saw it also as a continual
                    warning to North Korea that the U.S-ROK alliance was well and working. During
                    this post-Vietnam period, there was real concern in the U.S. and the ROK for the
                    North Korean threat. There were periodic shooting incidents across the DMZ;
                    President Park's wife was killed by a North Korean commando team; there were
                    discoveries of North Korean tunnels being dug under the DMZ; and the “tree
                    cutting incident” that I mentioned earlier occurred. The tensions were real and
                    palpable in the 1970's. Those don't exist today and probably haven't for some
                    years, the South Korean military have improved significantly. The situation on
                    the peninsula is far different today than it was in the 1970's. I should note
                    that joint exercises were not unique to South Korea; we held them with the
                    Thais, the Filipinos, and the Australians. In the 1970's they were certainly
                    warranted by the existing tense situation on the Korean peninsula.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>The Korean saga was only one of the major foreign policy initiatives of the
                    Carter administration. There were others which generated the same reaction in
                    many officials as the Korean troop withdrawal decision. We felt that some of the
                    ideas from the White House were weakening our alliances with the Japanese, the
                    Koreans, the Filipinos, etc. as well as building impediments to improving
                    relations with China. We were afraid that the Asian countries would view our
                    actions - or inactions - as an indication that we were reducing our interests in
                    Asia; that might have serious consequences for our posture in the area as well
                    as our national security. We felt that the initial general gesture of the Carter
                    administration would be interpreted in Asia as the continuation of retreat from
                    the area and reinforce the fears of the countries in the region from our
                    withdrawal from Vietnam. This skepticism of administration's policies and
                    initiatives in East Asia were felt most deeply by Mike Armacost at the NSC, Dick
                    Holbrooke, the State assistant secretary for EA, and myself.</p>
                <p>We asked for a meeting with Brzezinski to voice our concerns. He gave us about an
                    hour and listened patiently. At least from the outside, he didn't indicate any
                    agreement with our positions; he was Carter's NSC advisor and always defended
                    the president's policies. As far as I recall, he never gave an inch on Korea
                    during the lengthy evolution of that process. He may not have had his heart in
                    following the president's wishes, but he certainly did not fail to push Carter's
                    agenda. Zbig always referred to this meeting as having “met with the three
                    Cassandras.” I don't recall this meeting changing any of the administration's
                    initiatives, but we believe that our intervention might have raised some flags
                    in Brzezinski's mind which may have subsequently affected his thinking. I can't
                    be sure of that, but he certainly listened to our concerns and understood
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me now turn to the Philippines. What were the major
                        issues you had to deal with as deputy assistant secretary (ISA) in DoD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Early in the Carter administration, Secretary Vance called me over
                    and said he wanted me to come back to the Department to become Dick Holbrooke's
                    deputy in EA. I said no. During that meeting he suggested that perhaps the time
                    had come for us to withdraw from the Philippines - or at least to get out of
                    Clark Air Base. At about this time, the national security process had produced -
                    or was about to produce - a couple of National Security Memoranda (NSIM), which
                    were instructions to the bureaucracy to come with some answers to specific
                    policy questions. One dealt with Korea; the second related to the possible
                    elimination of our military bases at Clark and Subic in the Philippines.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>The first one State had the lead, the second DoD. I was appointed as chairman of
                    the inter-agency working group to draft the response to the Philippine NSIM. The
                    principal issue was a strategic one, whether we should withdraw from our bases,
                    long a basic part of our defense structure in the area. Unlike Korea, our
                    posture in the Philippines was a decision the president had not made. We
                    produced a paper which discussed the pros and cons; it was not, to the best of
                    my recollection, a source for serious inter-agency dispute, unlike the Korean
                    paper. It was a unanimous view that we should not withdraw from Subic naval
                    base. Clark was a more debatable proposition with people holding differing views
                    about the importance of that air base. My recollection is that the final draft
                    suggested that the decision on Clark be postponed and then be reviewed again in
                    a year or so. There was general agreement among the agencies that there were
                    already enough action already underway that would reduce our presence in Asia,
                    after our defeat in Vietnam, that this was not the right time to consider major
                    reductions in our presence in the Philippines. I think that all agencies shared
                    the concerns over Asian perceptions if we continued to reduce and reduce our
                    presence in the area.</p>
                <p>All of the administration's efforts also have to be viewed within the context of
                    its desire to normalize relations with China. This was a difficult issue in
                    light of all its wide impact. I personally favored the direction the
                    administration was taking toward finally carrying out normalization. But I was
                    also quite cognizant of the number of difficulties that such a policy would
                    create. The administration's considerations culminated in Brzezinski's trip to
                    Beijing in the summer of 1978 during which he told the Chinese that the U.S. had
                    made the decision to normalize by the end of the year.</p>
                <p>While China policy was moving ahead the USG was also focused on specific issues
                    such as troop withdrawal and base closings. China policy of course raised the
                    question of our relations with Taiwan which in fact had been under review since
                    the Ford administration. We received a presidential directive to develop a
                    withdrawal plan for our military presence on Taiwan, which ISA did. To further
                    complicate our Asian situation, the State Department was negotiating with
                    Vietnam to re-establish relations and they had gone very far. Given growing
                    China-Vietnam animosity the White House did not want to rock the China boat.
                    Holbrooke's negotiations with Vietnam ran into White House “buzz saw”. The two
                    efforte - normalization of our relations with China and the establishment of
                    relations with Vietnam - became conflicting objectives as there was a
                    bureaucratic battle. Vietnam lost out. The normalization of relations had to
                    wait a long time with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>This dilemma was not a problem for us in the Pentagon, but I closely followed
                    developments. I supported the draw-down of our troops in Taiwan. I also
                    supported the normalization of relations with Vietnam. DoD as an institution
                    took no position on these policy issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I mention these various policy development strands to illustrate the dilemmas
                    Carter - and Ford before him - faced in Asia before and after our withdrawal
                    from Vietnam. I was in the Pentagon for the first couple of years of the Ford
                    administration and watched the strains close up. There was no question that Asia
                    and our future there was very much on Carter's agenda. In the final analysis, it
                    was our efforts to improve relations with China that was certain and will be
                    most remembered by history.</p>
                <p>As I suggested before, there was an informal network in Washington among people
                    dealing with Asia. It consisted of a variety of offices in State, the NSC, and
                    ISA. Holbrooke, Armacost, and I were in frequent contact. We had a high degree
                    of intellectual camaraderie; we didn't necessarily always agree on every issue
                    (e.g. troop withdrawal from Korea), but we had intense and valuable discussions
                    on each issue. We worked together closely and were close personal friends. These
                    colleagues understood my position and even if not agreeing with me, at least
                    respected my views - unlike people like Stillwell who never took the time to try
                    to understand or even be factually correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier the efforts to have the Japanese pay
                        in part for our presence in their country. What else did you work on with
                        the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: In my last year in ISA (1977-78), the Japanese appointed a new
                    defense minister, whose name was Sakata. We became close and he was also deeply
                    interested in working with SecDef and other senior DoD officials to strengthen
                    our defense relations. He and I began to work on a paper which would establish
                    guidelines for the development of our defense relations. This became ultimately
                    a key document which was worked on for years after I left the Pentagon. It was
                    the basis for the enhancement and improvement of our defense relationships and
                    the beginning of an expanded Japanese role in the defense of their country. This
                    expanded role was in my mind one of the key ingredients in our post-Vietnam
                    military posture in the Far East. As I said before, my goals were to try to
                    prevent any weakening of that posture; to try to strengthen our relations with
                    Japan and Korea; and thirdly, to help accelerate the enhancement of our
                    relations with China, in great part, as a counter-balance to the Soviets. In the
                    case of the third goal, I must admit that the improvement of
                    military-to-military relations moved very slightly because we really had no
                    platform from which to operate. It is true that Brzezinski wanted DoD
                    representation on the team he took to Beijing both for cosmetic reasons - so
                    that the world would know the deepening of our relations - and to actually begin
                    a relationship between the two militaries and defense cooperation. I became the
                    personification of the “cosmetic reason”; specifically, I was charged with
                    briefing Chinese officials on Soviet involvement in Asia. I did make a
                    presentation which took about an hour and showed them pictures of Soviet
                    deployments, but I must admit that I don't think it was a very satisfactory
                    meeting because the Chinese refused to engage in any exchange of views; they
                    listened to us carefully, but were not prepared for a dialogue. They did have
                    some questions about some specific issues raised in my presentation, but there
                    was no real exchange of views. The Chinese were not ready to become seriously
                    involved in major issues such as Soviet activity in Asia. The briefing served
                    the purpose of breaking the ice, a necessary first step. The Chinese had an
                    opportunity to have new facts and intelligence brought to their attention; that
                    in itself was useful. I had hoped that my presentation would have been the start
                    of a serious discussion; in fact, that would take more time. The Brzezinski
                    visit was a crucial step in the development of Sino-American relations, and a
                    fascinating first experience for me in mainland China.</p>
                <p>We have discussed our efforts in Northeast Asia. We did not neglect Southeast
                    Asia at ISA. We created considerable angst in the region with the withdrawal
                    from Vietnam and our efforts to enhance Sino-U.S. relations. You have to
                    remember that our Vietnam involvement spread far beyond the borders of that
                    country into Laos and Cambodia and even into Thailand where we had five major
                    military bases. By the way, when I was ambassador to Thailand, I had an
                    opportunity to talk with McNamara who by then was the head of the World Bank. He
                    was very proud of the construction of those bases, pointing out that our
                    military efforts had important unintended consequences. The establishment of
                    bases had required the improvement indeed the development - of a huge road
                    network linking these facilities. In addition to enhancing our military
                    capabilities, these roads opened vast parts of Thailand to agricultural
                    production. The farmers could now deliver their products to profitable markets.
                    These bases changed the nature of agriculture in Thailand.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Thailand saw Vietnam as its principal enemy and they were also fighting a
                    domestic communist insurgency. ISA wrestled with two principal issues with
                    Thailand: 1) what to do with our sizeable number of bases or perhaps more
                    broadly, what should be our military presence be in that country and 2) how do
                    we reassure the Thais that we were still pledged by treaty to assist them in
                    maintaining their security and independence, particularly against Vietnam. Both
                    of these issues required much interaction with the Thais to give them confidence
                    in our commitments. They of course were concerned that our military reductions
                    would detract from our interest in Thailand; we tried to give them as much
                    military assistance as we could to offset the closing of the bases and help with
                    their insurgency in the north. Military assistance to Thailand was a useful tool
                    not only to improve Thai military capabilities but also to give visible meaning
                    to our verbal assurances of continuing support.</p>
                <p>I spent much time trying to increase military assistance programs to East Asia
                    countries, not only to the countries I have already discussed, but also to
                    countries like Indonesia. In Jakarta I made friends with the second most
                    important military official in the country, General Murdani, and traveled
                    throughout Indonesia with him to places like Borneo learning how the Indonesian
                    military was pursuing communist guerrilla insurgents. I did help increase our
                    military assistance program to Indonesia as I did for Korea and Thailand. I had
                    a lot of support from Erich von Marbod and General Howard Fish who were the
                    chief honchos in DSAA. I mention the Indonesian program specifically because it
                    will arise later in my career - in an unfavorable way - after my tour in
                    Thailand, but we can get to that later. While in ISA, I felt that Indonesia
                    deserved our assistance because it was the biggest and ultimately the most
                    important country in Southeast Asia. We were more than ten years removed from
                    the massacres that occurred in 1965. We had just withdrawn from Vietnam and the
                    Indonesians, as all South-East Asia people, were concerned by our policy in the
                    area. Could they count on our presence and our support?</p>
                <p>Indonesia was not only the biggest country in the area, it was key to the
                    creation of ASEAN in 1967, and the development of regional cooperation; it was
                    important to maintain close relations with it.</p>
                <p>You have to remember the ethos of that day. We were still in an era where we
                    feared communistic expansion; Vietnam and China expanding their influence
                    throughout Southeast Asia. Henry Kissinger, at the first ANZUS meeting after the
                    Vietnam War spoke of his great fear of communism expansion into Southeast Asia.
                    The region had guerrilla movements and insurgents. So Washington still had much
                    capital in South-east Asia, even though we had certainly receded in importance
                    from our Vietnam-involvement days. I felt that it remained an important area
                    which the U.S. should not neglect. Many of my colleagues in the Pentagon and
                    State had bigger fish to fry; that is, Vietnam was the past and there were
                    matters of greater urgency occurring in other parts of the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Before you turn to my next assignment, I should say a word or two about Cambodia
                    and Laos. We had turned a page; the U.S. had more or less opted out of Indochina
                    after our withdrawal from Vietnam. The general sentiment in Washington was that
                    little could be done in and for those countries. There wasn't much thought given
                    to the consequences of political instability in both countries. Eventually, the
                    ever increasing flow of refugees into neighboring countries brought Cambodia and
                    Laos back into the limelight. The refugees bore witness to the catastrophes
                    developing in both countries. The instability in the area became evident to all
                    and its human consequences became a world-wide issue. By the time I arrived in
                    Bangkok, the refugee issue was a deep seeded humanitarian challenge. It took us
                    some time before we really became engaged. There was a period right after the
                    end of the Vietnam War when we were mostly observers of a steadily declining
                    human situation.</p>
                <p>In 1977, Deputy Secretary of Defense Charles Duncan called me and asked me to
                    assume responsibility for our posture and activities in Latin America, as I had
                    been doing for the Far East. This came somewhat as a surprise; the two areas had
                    little in common, but for economy purposes he had decided to eliminate the DAS
                    for Latin America. So I saluted and began to look into Latin American affairs,
                    which regrettable I knew little. I used some of the savings to take a trip to
                    the area. I visited Colonel Lucas in Guatemala, General Pinochet in Chile,
                    General Viola in Argentina, Admiral Ortega in Brazil. My task in those countries
                    was to get them to stop their massive human rights abuses. I basically told them
                    that they had to do this or we would distance ourselves from them and provide no
                    assistance to them. Before I went on this trip, one relatively senior official
                    strongly opposed to our military relationships with these dictators, but more
                    broadly felt that we should not only break with them but end our military to
                    military ties which he considered dangerous to democracy. It was difficult to
                    incorporate his message with my responsibilities as a DoD official, but his
                    intervention alerted me to the sensitivity that existed about some of our ties
                    to Latin America.</p>
                <p>I did indeed deliver the message to all of the dictators, but I saw no subsequent
                    impact on their policies. Our military at the time did not have “human rights”
                    very high on its agenda. I did emphasize our policy to the defense attach�s and
                    MAAG chiefs I met on the trip to make sure they understood where the Carter
                    administration was coming from. They had specific tasks to accomplish; what they
                    thought of the host government was not usually a factor in their duties. My
                    focus was to clear any doubts in the host government's mind; there was a
                    connection between their human rights policies and our support. I don't think
                    they trembled at my words. It did further my education on dealing with senior
                    foreign officials in an adversarial way.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>We did also try to be helpful on some specific issues such as the long-standing
                    border dispute between Peru and Chile. I don't think any of these efforts did
                    much good in the year I had responsibility for Latin America. I learned a
                    considerable amount about an area new to me. It may have been an unfortunate
                    period for learning because most of the Latin American countries during the
                    1970's were going through some hard times and dictatorship was rampant.
                    Guatemala was particularly awful. In light of my other responsibilities, I
                    really didn't devote that much attention to Latin America; but focused mostly on
                    what I considered major issues. I left my deputy who spent full time on Latin
                    American issues to do most of the daily work. I had confidence in him. He would
                    brief me daily on new developments, which we would then discuss and agree on
                    whether any action was warranted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One final question about your tour in ISA. You obviously
                        had no problem getting to issues which you felt warranted secretarial or
                        deputy secretarial level attention. Was that a unique situation or did all
                        the deputy ISA secretaries have the same kind of access?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I don't know. It varied. All the three secretaries I worked for were
                    interested in ISA. I think the fact that I had permission to deal with the
                    secretary directly may have been unusual. I was fortunate that the assistant
                    secretaries I worked for were really interested in issues pertaining to other
                    areas of the world - Europe and the Middle East. They showed enough confidence
                    to allow me to work on Asian matters without too much guidance as long as I kept
                    them informed. Occasionally, they might get slightly annoyed because I had, in
                    their eyes, strayed from what they might have done, but by and large, I was
                    pretty much left to my own devices. It was the best job I had to date. There is
                    no question that my work for Elliot Richardson had made my name known in DoD and
                    that proved helpful. Furthermore, I spent considerable time working with senior
                    military officials. I might not always agree with their stands, but I could talk
                    to most of them frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that some of the issues you managed to raise
                        to the secretary's level would have risen to that level in any case or were
                        raised to there because of your personal relationship with each of the
                        Secretaries of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Certainly many of them would have gotten there anyway. A number of
                    issues I generated to a higher level were labor cost shaving in jargon. I do
                    believe that my approach worked pretty well and enabled us to get many things
                    done. It is also true, as I said earlier, that my direct bosses, the assistant
                    secretaries, were personally more engaged in other parts of the world, leaving
                    the deputies for those regions more closely supervised than I was. The secretary
                    and the deputy secretary became accustomed to calling me first if they had any
                    questions about East Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Before I end my recollections of my tour as DAS in ISA I should make a few
                    comments about Philippine base negotiations. The Filipinos were always uncertain
                    about whether to open fresh negotiations on bases; they felt a critical need to
                    do so, but they were concerned about American reactions. I am now talking about
                    the period after our withdrawal from Vietnam. Finally, negotiations did begin;
                    at one stage the U.S. delegation was chaired by deputy secretary of Defense Bill
                    Clements. These initial discussions were primarily designed to see what Manila
                    wanted from negotiations. Much of their agenda, not all of it, not surprisingly
                    dealt with increases of assistance as well as greater symbolic manifestations of
                    Philippine control over the leases. Money was the coin of the realm.</p>
                <p>For much of the time, the negotiations were very informal. The meetings were
                    mostly held at embassy counselor levels in Manila. They had many ups and downs
                    with various items periodically becoming the foci. There was an important
                    meeting on base negotiations in 1976, just before the end of the Ford
                    administration, in New York. Bill Clements and I attended to meet with the
                    defense minister; our principal purpose was to agree on what needed to be
                    decided. There were a lot of rumors about the negotiations and the Philippine
                    positions, and we felt we needed clarification in order to proceed with our
                    internal work. I think this was probably the first meeting after a number of
                    years and we got a full expression of Philippine needs and wants.</p>
                <p>I think a State representative was with us as well, but I don't remember who it
                    was. I kept State fully informed about these base negotiations and Defense's
                    position on various issues. Being an FSO made the coordination easier and I
                    think that Defense and State worked on these base negotiations as an effective
                    team, even though we might have had disagreements on some of the issues. In
                    light of what I viewed as a very effective process, I proposed to Holbrooke, and
                    he himself may have before, concluded to have an informal weekly meeting
                    attended by the senior officials around Washington who were working on EA
                    matters. Dick was an excellent chairman and I think the meeting made all of our
                    efforts much more effective and made coordination among agencies easier. It was
                    a mechanism that I think still exists.</p>
                <p>Later, during 1977-78 period, after I had chaired the interagency working group
                    that I mentioned earlier, the success of base negotiations began to be tied to
                    the Philippine human rights behavior. Patt Derian, the assistant secretary of
                    State for human rights, became involved thereby generating a major disagreement
                    between her and Holbrooke, on how to deal with Marcos. We had some heated
                    discussions in Washington about the importance of the bases. As the interagency
                    group had recommended, we pursued negotiations with the objective of continuing
                    our base arrangements despite Marcos' sorry human rights record. This decision
                    was made at Cabinet level. In the summer 1978, higher level negotiations were
                    resumed. Holbrooke and I met with Marcos during this period to discuss the
                    issues. We didn't reach any agreement at that time, but it was the beginning of
                    a new high level negotiations process over the bases; the first in many
                    years.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I well remember the setting in Marcos' office. The defense minister was on one
                    side of a long table in his conference room and Holbrooke and I were sitting on
                    the opposite side. Marcos sat at the head of the table, as if acting as the
                    mediator between his defense minister and ourselves. After the meeting, we joke
                    about Marcos' fairness. Before negotiations really got serious, I dropped out to
                    go to Thailand.</p>
                <p>As for Japan, I mentioned that we had some successful negotiations concerning
                    Japanese financing of our military presence in that country. By “we”, I mean the
                    whole American team, our military in Japan, our embassy, and ISA of State. We
                    had first of all to collect a lot of detailed information - financial and
                    otherwise - about our operations, which our military supplied. Our senior Air
                    Force officer in Japan, who had been the secretary's military aide and whom I
                    knew well, was deeply involved and did the lion's share of the negotiations. The
                    Washington team which I headed discussed the general principals and the U.S.
                    objectives with the Japanese foreign office and defense officials, but the
                    nitty-gritty was left to the Air Force general and his staff. Our discussions
                    lasted a year and produced concrete results, ultimately leading to billions of
                    dollars of savings each year.</p>
                <p>The Philippine and Japan base negotiations illustrate two common problems that
                    have held true for almost, if not all, base issues, at least two decades ago.
                    First of all were problems associated with the American presence- drunken
                    behavior, inadvertent accidents, noise generated by our planes, etc. Such
                    problems are not solely connected with bases; naval port calls often generate
                    the same kind of negative behavioral actions. We in ISA, usually in connection
                    with the Joint Staff of the Chiefs of Staffs, spent a lot of time negotiating
                    such issues. The second problem was the status of forces agreements and all the
                    negotiations which had to be undertaken in order to preserve the judicial
                    position of U.S. military on foreign soil. This was always a major issue, and
                    was always on our desks.</p>
                <p>The “status-of-forces” agreements were generally a challenge. We had to protect
                    our men and women from arbitrary actions by the host country while it had a
                    responsibility to its citizens to protect them from a wayward American soldier
                    or sailor. The signing of an agreement was only the beginning; the daily
                    workload was frequently generated by activity on the ground which required an
                    interpretation of the agreement. Some of the incidents had the potential of
                    developing into serious political friction and we obviously did our best to try
                    to avoid such escalations. But the process to handle these incidents was time
                    consuming as were the inter-and intra-agency deliberations leading up to and
                    including these instances and the broader international negotiations. An office
                    in ISA/DoD was charged with conducting status-of-forces agreements. Phil
                    Barringer headed that office where he had worked on these issues for at least 25
                    years. U.S. policy on both sets of issues was set by an inter-agency group with
                    this ISA office being the chief implementer.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Personally, my involvement with base negotiations was limited to the Philippines
                    and Japan and later Turkey, where we also held a number of discussions about our
                    base structure in that country.</p>
                <p>I should not end the discussion of base negotiations and status-of-forces
                    agreements without tipping my hat to our embassies in the countries with which
                    we were negotiating. They were of vast help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1978, you were appointed as U.S. Ambassador to
                        Thailand. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: There was a question of whether I would be assigned to Thailand or
                    the Philippines. During my tour in ISA, I had developed a very close
                    relationship with Phil Habib, first when he was the assistant secretary for EA
                    and then when he became the undersecretary for political affairs. We were
                    essentially on the same wave length. He was a unique, wonderful character,
                    almost universally liked and respected. We always got along quite well most of
                    the time. Of course, Phil was one of the Department's experts not only on Korea,
                    but also on South East Asia. I kept him posted on what we were doing in Defense;
                    I testified with him before Congressional committees. He was a superb witness.
                    He used to say: “Senator (or Congressman), that is an extraordinary important
                    question. You have obviously great insights.” He could go on in this vein
                    question after question; I could never do that, but I certainly admired his
                    touch. He was much respected on the Hill.</p>
                <p>When it was time to move on from DoD, Phil was very helpful. He wanted to make
                    sure that I would get an embassy. Holbrooke was also very supportive and
                    basically made it happen. The first opportunity arose in the Philippines, but
                    Phil thought that since this would be my first ambassadorial assignment, that a
                    smaller post, one less in the limelight, might be more appropriate. He thought
                    Thailand would do. That was fine with me especially since I knew most of the
                    Thai leaders - as I did in the Philippines as well. So the Department nominated
                    me for Thailand.</p>
                <p>I had not served in the Department or in an embassy for five-six years. Of
                    course, both as POLAD and as deputy assistant secretary for ISA, I had
                    maintained continual contact with State and especially the EA bureau. So it
                    wasn't as if I had been on a different planet for all those years; I just wasn't
                    physically in the State building or an embassy. I was familiar with all of the
                    EA issues and knew the bureau well. Even though I had maintained this close
                    contact, going from second secretary to an ambassador was a little unusual. I
                    had not taken the usual route - embassy counselor (or deputy assistant secretary
                    in State) to DCM to ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>There were four aspects that helped prepare me to become an ambassador in the
                    area. One was the opportunity to become acquainted with all the major political
                    figures in East Asia. The Thai prime minister, who had been at my house for
                    dinner, was very happy with my appointment. Two, I had spent at least six years
                    working on East Asia year in INR, a year as POLAD and four years in ISA. I knew
                    the area well. Three, I had a regional view and could fit our relationships with
                    any particular country into a regional framework. Fourth, I had worked at
                    sufficiently high levels for several years to understand how to influence policy
                    development and which issues would be of most interest to the highest levels of
                    our government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about managerial experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: If the truth be known, very few State Department employees have an
                    opportunity to acquire the kind of broad experience that one needs to manage a
                    large embassy. I think my career experiences were fairly unique: I had managed
                    two sizeable organizationthe EA section of ISA (25-30 employees) and the EA
                    division in INR (also 25-30 employees). Was that enough to run an embassy?
                    Probably not, but then as I said I don't think any State employees have much
                    opportunity to have sufficiently broad assignments to prepare him or her for a
                    major ambassadorial assignment. I wasn't even able to attend the ambassadorial
                    training course that FSI sponsors because it did not exist in 1978. I did have
                    eighteen years of Foreign Service experience, much of which was with other
                    agencies, so that in some ways I was better prepared than many other
                    ambassadorial appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your confirmation hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: They went very smoothly, like most ambassadorial hearings. There were
                    a couple of amusing stories surrounding the hearings. Vice-President Mondale had
                    taken me with him when he visited South East Asia. He felt that the U.S. was not
                    paying enough attention to the area, despite its many problems. We went to
                    Thailand and as is customary, a formal dinner was given Mondale by the King. I
                    was pretty tired by this time. It came time for Mondale to propose a toast and I
                    could barely movin fact, I might well have been dozing. The Thai official who
                    sat next to mwho later became a good friend and foreign ministephysically lifted
                    me to my feet and put a glass in my hand so that I could join the toast.</p>
                <p>Mondale swore me as ambassador in a White House ceremony. During his comments,
                    Mondale said: “I took Abramowitz to South East Asia. He was so very
                    interestelike hell!”, referring to my catnap in Bangkok. He knew what had
                    happened and he took the swearing in occasion to comment at some length about my
                    “attention span” and “my devotion.”</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I arrived in August 1978, in Bangkok, about a month after my confirmation. Of
                    course, I had been working on Thai issues for five years and was familiar with
                    most of them. I had much to learn about Thailand: the local politics, the
                    country itself, etc. In general my break-in period went smoothlmuch different
                    from what I encountered later when I went to Turkey. Before leaving the U.S. I
                    called on the senior Thai officials in the U.S. the ambassador, the UN
                    delegation, etc. I even gave a speech using the little Thai I had learned at a
                    dinner given by the ambassador for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you surprised by anything you had to do as ambassador
                        which was different from what you anticipated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Not really. In some respects, the job was less intellectually
                    challenging than my ISA one or some of my other previous assignments. But it was
                    challenging getting to understand where our hosts were coming from.</p>
                <p>Our embassy in Thailand was among the largest in the world (700 or so American
                    employees). We had a number of regional offices headquartered in Bangkok which
                    although not requiring much attention, were nevertheless under my jurisdiction.
                    We had a large CIA component. I liked the job immensely, largely because I
                    became involved in one of the major refugee crises of our time. I also enjoyed
                    being in Turkey, which became immensely challenging, particularly when the Gulf
                    War began.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you decide what you expected from your DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I had two DCM's in Bangkok: Dan O'Donohue who had been put in Bangkok
                    by Habib before my arrival and who was with me for about six or seven months. He
                    was enormously helpful. He was very smart, dedicated and honest. He could be a
                    stickler. Dan was succeeded by Burt Levin, also very capable and had great
                    personal skills. The two men were very different. I had asked that Burt be
                    assigned to Bangkok, after Dan was transferred. He had wide experience and knew
                    Thailand and the embassy quite well. He was also an excellent Chinese speaker.
                    He had lots of knowledge that I didn't have and we were a good team. I put great
                    trust in both men.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>To some degree, I took care of external relationwith the government and other
                    embassieand the DCM worried about the management of the U.S. embassy. I
                    emphasize “to some degree” because not all issues fall neatly in such
                    compartmentalization. I always made an effort to get to know our stafI used to
                    walk to all the sections frequentlbut in general, I left the management of the
                    building to the DCMs. I think there was no question that because of my contacts,
                    I was better informed about such issues as the Thai domestic politics than my
                    deputies were. I have always operated with a “hands-on” philosophy; I liked to
                    get information directly from the people who knew.</p>
                <p>I remember one major management issue that fell in my lap soon after my arrival
                    in Bangkok. The Department was going through one of its periodic “reduction in
                    size of embassies” exercises. Bangkok was focused on, quite rightly because I
                    thought it was too big. I mentioned the CIA component earlier; its scope had
                    been reduced over a period of years but the size of the staff never reflected
                    the decrease on work-load. The management of a reduction in force is difficult
                    in the best of circumstances; it was difficult in Bangkok in light of the number
                    of agencies that had representatives there as well as their staff sizes. I had a
                    prolonged debate with the Agency about the size of its component; I mentioned
                    earlier the obstinate position I took on one of the military attach�s that made
                    Admiral Weisner an opponent for the rest of my career. Reluctantly, I cut some
                    of the AID staff. We made no cuts in the staffing of the group assisting
                    refugees. The State contingent itself had to take some reductions. In any case,
                    I spent a lot of time negotiating with the heads of the embassy sections and the
                    other agencies. It is very hard to be responsive to a Washington directive of
                    this sort, even if you agree with it, without engendering some hostility and
                    hard feelings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little about your relationships with Washington
                        while ambassador to Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: First of all, it should be noted that I went to a country with which
                    I was somewhat familiar with. I also had the advantage of having had an
                    opportunity to meet most of the senior Thai officials. In fact, the Thai prime
                    minister had been my guest at a dinner. The assignment involved managing the
                    continuing change in the relationship between the two countries, which stemmed
                    in part from our withdrawal from Vietnam and in part from a Thai insurgency, and
                    in part because Thailand was growing. I did not foresee a huge refugee problem.
                    I was struck by the difficult situation in Cambodia, which was not news to me,
                    but was escalating without much American attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I was also fortunate in my relationship with Washington because I knew well the
                    leadership of State and Defense as well as the NSC. I knew CINCPAC quite well
                    from my tour of duty there a few years earlier. It didn't hurt that some of my
                    personal close friends were in senior positions dealing with EA matterHolbrooke,
                    Oakley, Negroponte, Armacost, Platt. Not only did we know each other well, but
                    we had worked together for extended periods. Communications were easy. I spent a
                    lot of time on the telephone. Sometimes it was just to pick up the latest
                    new“gossip” but most of the time the discussion was on issues of immediate
                    concern to me. Of course, we used the more formal method of
                    communicationcablewhen an issue was ripe for decision and detailed discussion
                    was necessary. Telephone was far better for informal dialogues and for providing
                    a better sense of the scene. I also found that in most cases, I would get
                    prompter action as result of a telephone call than from a cable. I particularly
                    used the phone to get action when time was not on our side. There is no question
                    that having people whom you know and in whom you have confidence at the other
                    end of a telephone call not only enhanced effectiveness but was extremely useful
                    when a situation changed radically. That was true even in those rare cases where
                    we had a serious difference of opinion.</p>
                <p>I made it a habit to return to Washington at least every three months. This was
                    primarily because I had issues, particularly those that related to the refugee
                    problems in Thailand, that needed face-to-face dialogues to get expedited. I
                    followed the same travel pattern when I was ambassador to Turkey. As a general
                    principle, I think every ambassador who is dealing with complex issues, should
                    return to Washington periodically. I am now referring to important and difficult
                    issues which require continuing ambassadorial attention. In the late 1970's,
                    Thailand was a “major” post; it may well have receded in importance now, but
                    then, particularly in light of the refugee issues, and the fear of communist
                    expansion, it was considered a very important country. Today the issues seem
                    more of a commercial nature, more routine than what we faced at the end of the
                    1970's. It is a good way also to keep your problems high on the agenda of
                    Washington agencies.</p>
                <p>Both the phone calls and these periodic trips helped to short-cut the
                    bureaucratic process. That process on important matters is a mixture of the
                    formal and informal. If it were just a matter of writing a memo and sending it
                    up the chain of command, not much would likely get done quickly. Informal
                    efforts helped move the ball, even such issues of high importance. I was also in
                    a fortunate situation because Holbrooke and a few others involved in EA issues
                    were sufficiently influential that it was not necessary for me to communicate
                    with the Secretary or the deputy secretary. I knew that if Dick got involved in
                    an issue, I would get action from Washington. On the Pentagon side, my old boss
                    was Harold Brown, then SecDef, whom I could contact if necessary. It was also
                    true that during my Washington assignment, I had an opportunity to become
                    acquainted with Vice President Mondale, Jim Johnson, people on Mrs. Carter's
                    staff, etc. Henry Owen, then an ambassador-at-large, was extremely helpful when
                    the Cambodian crisis arose. This range of personal contacts were simply
                    indispensable.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I also had that head start because of my acquaintance with senior South East Asia
                    leadership. For example, I could talk straight forwardly to Lee Kuan Yew and
                    deliver views in blunt terms. In my Bangkok assignment, I was reaping the fruits
                    of previous incarnations. The proximity to power provides access, which then
                    should develop an atmosphere of mutual confidence and trust which tends to grow
                    over time. I could not replicate that situation today. All the leadership I knew
                    is either dead or in retirement. When I travel to the area today, I often meet
                    old friends whose influence has waned considerably, if not vanished
                    completely.</p>
                <p>I think in general it is fair to say that we in Bangkok established a solid
                    relationship with Washington. We had their confidence. It was also important
                    that the people in Washington who handled EA issues were influential in their
                    own agencies and in the broad bureaucracy. That continued in the first six
                    months I was there in the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask an unfair question, which you may not be able
                        to answer. Do you believe that the time senior officials in State spent on
                        Thai issues because you brought them to their attention might have been used
                        for higher priorities issues in other parts of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The Secretary of State has problems raised with him from many
                    quarters. There are times such as today, when one issutoday it is Iradrives most
                    other matters off the Secretary's agenda or at least lowers them in priority.
                    There is always a problem between the immediate and the important. When I went
                    to Bangkok, I was surprised, as I mentioned earlier, by the fierce competition
                    among Vietnam, China, and Thailand. We reported extensively on those tensions
                    trying to portray as best we could the case each side was putting forth. The
                    Khmer Rouge was behaving very badly on the Vietnam-Cambodia border. The
                    Vietnamese became very upset which was not helped by China siding with Cambodia;
                    the Thai to some degree also supported the Cambodians. These tensions became
                    very acute after my arrival in Bangkok. It could be argued that we really didn't
                    have “a dog in this fight,” but we were at that point trying to normalize
                    relationships with both China and Vietnam and our friend Thailand was deeply
                    worried. Did senior officials need to know about it? Sure. There were many other
                    important or more important issues. Id did what I had to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The Thai position in South East Asia raised a number of policy issues for us.
                    First of all, we didn't know how they would respond to the Vietnamese
                    approaching their borders. I thought they would do nothing but I could not be
                    sure. The prime minister warned me that if the Vietnamese crossed the bordeor
                    even came too closthere would be war. I don't think he meant this literally, but
                    he probably made that comment to me to motivate us to take some action to
                    prevent Vietnamese military movements. Secondly, we wanted to keep Thailand
                    stable, internally so that the government could deal with the refugee problem
                    without having to worry about its domestic position. Furthermore, we wanted
                    stability so that the government could deal with a Vietnamese threat, although
                    we did not see that as a likely scenario. We were concerned with the possibility
                    of the Vietnamese taking action against some of the refugee camps. There were
                    occasional shellings, which raised our level of anxiety, but nothing more
                    happened. Our ability to assist the refugees depended a great deal on Thailand
                    internal stability which in part depended on the actions of its neighbors. That
                    is one reason we were so insistent on the Vietnamese leaving Cambodia after
                    their invasion.</p>
                <p>We tried to assist Thailand in maintaining stability by increasing our assistance
                    programs. We provided fundmostly for footo assist those Thais who might have
                    been impacted by the refugee problem. We increased our military assistance
                    program to give the Thai military greater confidence in its ability to defend
                    their country. I spent a lot of time on this whole set of issues. I had long
                    conversations with our governmental leaders about increasing, for example, the
                    Thai tank fleet. I am not sure that they really needed them, but the Thai
                    military thought they were essential; so I threw my full support behind their
                    request for more general reasons.</p>
                <p>Of greatest importance perhaps were our efforts to mobilize ASEAN support against
                    the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and to encourage the nations in that
                    grouping to take counter-measures to get the Vietnamese to return to their own
                    territory. I had, I thought, a significant conversation on this issue with Lee
                    Kwan Yew about two weeks after the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodihe was visiting
                    Bangkok. I made the point that leadership was lacking in the region and that it
                    was time for ASEAN, at Lee Kwan Yew's urging, to step up, write their views, and
                    take some vigorous action. I said that a regional approach was absolutely
                    essential if stability in the area were to be maintained. There were a number of
                    pressures on ASEAN, which did in fact motivate it to take a strong posture
                    against Vietnam. Numerous ministerial meetings which the U.S. attended took
                    place. Ultimately, these actions helped stimulate Cambodian resistance to the
                    Vietnamese invasion, particularly in the border areas. The ASEAN reaction was
                    also important because for the first time in my memory, it galvanized the
                    regional grouping to act as one on a security issue, thereby setting the basis,
                    hopefully, for future action.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese invasion spurred a closer U.S.-Thai relationship. We provided
                    increased assistancpolitical, economic, military. We mobilized ASEAN to give the
                    Thais regional support in its efforts to stabilize the region as well as
                    massively assisting with refugees. It was certainly not a one-way street; we
                    used their territory to house over a million people.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I think I should note here that the Thais intensely disliked and feared the
                    Vietnamese. The Chinese also disliked the Vietnamese. So the obvious occurred;
                    the Thais and the Chinese mesecretltwo weeks after the Vietnamese invasion. From
                    that meeting, which we learned about from intelligence sources, came Chinese
                    military assistance to the Khmer Rouge which flowed through Thailand. This
                    program raised doubts in some minds. It also raised a moral conflict. I was
                    personally opposed to any assistance to the Khmer Rouge, except for humanitarian
                    aid to their dependents. The Khmer Rouge were murderers and butchers. For
                    political and moral reasons it was unwise to give them any armed assistance,
                    regardless of the purpose. I urged the Thais not to get involved in this Chinese
                    program. Holbrooke took the same line. There had been no presidential directive
                    on our position toward this program, but at least in State there was general
                    agreement that the Thais should not assist the Khmer Rouge. I suggested to the
                    prime minister that he stop the flow of arms to the Khmer Rouge. I had the
                    opportunity to discuss this issue with Carter and Mondale making my case for
                    opposing assistance to the Khmer Rouge. I thought we should be very careful
                    about supporting them, regardless of what the Vietnamese were doing in Cambodia.
                    This got kicked around a lot.</p>
                <p>During 1979, the Thai prime minister and his delegation visited Washington. They
                    had a meeting with Brzezinski who told the Thai to go ahead and support the
                    Khmer Rouge. The Thais were receiving mixed messages and had to figure out whom
                    to believe. I had not doubt whose advice they would follow. The Thais,
                    regardless of what we said, were going to proceed with the arms supply program.
                    They felt that participation was in their own self-interest. In the final
                    analysis, I don't think that the Thais' involvement had any effect on our
                    standing in the regionor am I sure it was of much help to the Khmer Rouge. At
                    the time, this issue was of great concern to all of us for another reason; we
                    were preparing to assist the non-communist resistance in Cambodia, but not the
                    Khmer Rouge. I had the first meeting with the leadership of the non-communist
                    resistance; it didn't have any concrete results, but it was an important gesture
                    of support on our part. When I left Thailand, the Vietnamese still had control
                    of the border areas and soon thereafter we gave non military support to the non
                    Khmer Rouge resistance and they got military aid from other countries.</p>
                <p>Going back before war began, we had considerable arguments. First, would Vietnam
                    invade Cambodia and second, what would China do under those circumstances? What
                    impact would war have on other countries in the area, including Thailand, as
                    well as regional groupings such as ASEAN? There was a major difference of views
                    between the embassy and the CIA. The embassy believed that the Vietnamese would
                    invade Cambodia. I don't believe that we predicted that the Vietnamese would
                    march toward Thailand and occupy all of Cambodia. CIA was less sure. In either
                    case, the U.S. had to be a bystander; there wasn't much we could do about the
                    Vietnamese.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I discussed briefly the moral dilemma on aiding the Khmer Rouge. A second part
                    was the interrelated one of the Cambodian issue in the Ui.e., should the U.S.
                    allow the Khmer Rouge regime to participate in the UN and thereby not sanctify
                    the Vietnamese invasion. Real politik and morality collided here too. As these
                    developments became a matter of interest to the American public. It may not have
                    been as high on our foreign policy agenda as events in the Soviet Union or the
                    Middle East but it attracted a lot of public interest. The Cambodia issue also
                    brought South East Asia to the attention of the public, and it was not long
                    after my arrival in Bangkok that Thailand also began to be seen once in a while
                    on Page 1 of American newspapers. Thailand was pictured as a “front line” state
                    in our battle with communism.</p>
                <p>In Thailand and its neighbors, the instability in Indochina had serious
                    consequences. Most important, there was an increasing flow of refugees across
                    the border. The Cambodian war changed that situation dramatically. The refugee
                    flow increased exponentially. Cambodia's agriculture production plummeted
                    thereby making the situation in Cambodia even more dire than it had been.
                    Compounding the humanitarian problem was an increasing flow of Vietnamese
                    fleeing their country by boats and vast numbers of Lao and Hmong from Laos. The
                    Chinese incursion into Vietnam just further aggravated the refugee problems with
                    more people fleeing their homes in the hopes of finding safety in a nearby
                    country. Although the U.S. was aware of a refugee problem in the late part of
                    1978, it became my major pre-occupation in 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend considerable time while in Bangkok briefing
                        reporters on Thai issues? Did you get good coverage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I spent considerable time talking to reporters, almost anyone I would
                    talk to about the refugee situation. As I mentioned before, our issues became
                    front page material in the American press, particularly after the refugee crisis
                    really began. Many reporters came from the U.S. just to look at refugee camps
                    and to learn about the crisis. It was a veritable flood.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Not only did reporters seek information about the crises in South-east Asia, but
                    so did members of Congress. I think that during my three years in Bangkok, we
                    had about 300 senators and representatives visit Thailand. Most of them were
                    focused on the refugee issue, a few on inspecting the military post office.
                    President Carter paroled into the U.S. about 164,000 refugees during a two year
                    period, part of an influx into the U.S. of some million and a half Indochinese.
                    Carter's was an extraordinary action, one unparalleled in our history. The
                    problem became so gripping that the embassy was the subject of a CBS special TV
                    program. Secretary Vance called me and said that he had suggested that our
                    embassy be the subject of a program that CBS was developing on what an embassy
                    does day in and day out. He asked me whether I would be willing to be the
                    subject of such a program. I, of course, readily agreed. Ours was a unique
                    situation, but in general we received very extensive coverage by the American
                    media. Ed Bradley spent time with us on the CBS special. I made it a practice to
                    try to have any media visitor eat breakfast or lunch with me. In any case most
                    of the reporters wanted to spend time with me. We were the “point” on the
                    refugee problem.</p>
                <p>Let me talk a little about the war itself. It had several aspects: first of all,
                    the vast destruction that the fighting caused in Cambodia was largely
                    responsible for the great exodus and a concomitant severe decline in
                    agricultural production. That became a challenge for the world because we had to
                    find ways to feed the Cambodians. Secondly, refugees were fleeing not only into
                    Thailand, but also to Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries creating political
                    tensions and accelerating calls for international action. Two international
                    meetings were called to focus on the Indochinese refugee problem.</p>
                <p>Then there was the challenge of how the U.S. and other interested countries would
                    respond to the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. This issue and the refugee
                    problem were separate but obviously related; they both involved Thailand deeply
                    and became central to the efforts of our mission.</p>
                <p>The refugee problem started long before I reached Bangkok. But it was a trickle
                    before the war. We were allowing somnot maninto the U.S. But over a period of
                    time, there was a steady growth until we reached flood stage. After the war
                    began refugees from all over Indochina and headed to Thailand. The first
                    challenge was to make sure that the Thais would let them into their country.
                    This was not a one time negotiation; the issue of “open” borders was a
                    continuing and ever-present concern, which was constantly discussed with the
                    Thai government.</p>
                <p>Once the refugees were in Thailand, we had to come up with an assistance program
                    for them. They could not be absorbed into the Thai community; there were just
                    too many and how long they would stay was uncertaisomething that truly disturbed
                    the Thai. Few refugees were willing to return homwith the Khmer Rouge and a war
                    going on. So these were seen as “permanent” re-settlers so to speak.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So we wanted Thailand to allow the refugees into their country and then assist in
                    their support; two, we needed to feed the people who remained in Cambodia; and
                    three, we wanted longer term actions to help stabilize the area. The embassy
                    took the lead on all three issues. We pushed the Thais to let the refugees into
                    their country and to provide some hospitality; we started a massive feeding
                    program for the people living in western Cambodia, using Thailand as a base of
                    operations; we were instrumental in starting a massive resettlement program,
                    including opening our borders to more Indochinese refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we so interested in the refugee problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: In part, I think we had some feeling of guilt stemming from dumping
                    Vietnam and helping create a vast human tragedy. It was all apparent and could
                    not be hidden like in North Korea. In part, it was also because the U.S. is a
                    country of refugees and has usually been quite forthcoming in opening our
                    borders to people in dire straits who have lost everything. The American people
                    had plenty of first hand evidence from the media of the tragedy occurring in
                    South-east Asia. We were interested in helping refugees also for political
                    reasonthe stability of Thailand and the whole area. There were a lot of reasons
                    for our involvement, but basically, our historical humanitarian instincts have
                    often come to the rescue of people in deep trouble around the world. Jimmy
                    Carter was also a dedicated humanitarian.</p>
                <p>Moreover, it was clear that we would not return into Cambodia with any military
                    or any other force to reverse the Khmer Rouge coup. A military response was
                    simply politically impossible. But assisting refugees, particularly since we
                    were part of the cause for the human tragedy, was.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Bangkok, we may have had 10-15 thousand refugees in country.
                    The embassy had a refugee office and we were processing some applications for
                    entrance into the U.S. Lionel Rosenblatt, who is one of the real heroes of this
                    story, was relentless in trying to protect those refugees. But in 1978, the
                    program was not large.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>It became a massive program during my tour. The war created about 600-700
                    thousand Cambodian refugees. Then there was the outflow from Vietnam too, which
                    probably ranged in the 200-300 or perhaps even more. There was the outflow from
                    Laos of perhaps 200,000. During the period I was in Bangkok, I would estimate
                    that approximately 1 million people of Indochina became refugees, and countless
                    numbers were displaced in their own country. We conducted negotiations with all
                    the countries involved; we tried to get the pertinent UN agencies more deeply
                    involved; we organized or prodded others to hold international conferences on
                    this human tragedy. We made sure that all relevant U.S. agencies were kept
                    informed of events on the ground through our continual reporting; one huge
                    stimulus was Mrs. Carter's trip to Thailand for a first hand view of the
                    situation in November, 1979. We had asked for a visible major response from
                    Washington and they decided that a visit by the First Lady would have a maximum
                    impact. It was a difficult moment for Mrs. Carter because her trip started soon
                    after the Iranian hostage crisis began and she was deeply worried. Her visit to
                    Thailand was a transforming event, which helped immeasurably in making the U.S.
                    and the world understand the depth of the crisis, and forcing attention to it
                    and encouraging the world to respond. She was enormously helpful, there and
                    subsequently.</p>
                <p>We thought up many schemes to get food into Cambodia, including via air drops. We
                    got full support from Washington. Henry Owen, then on the NSC staff, was a
                    bulldozer and would call me frequently to see whether we needed anything. I
                    could not have asked for better back-stopping from Washington. The international
                    agencies unfortunately were not as forthcoming. We had major battles with some
                    of them; they were slow on the draw and initially inadequate for the task. At
                    one stage, I was going to have a press conference to denounce the UNHCR for its
                    desultory behavior, but my staff talked me out of it. As far as I could tell,
                    there were no policy impediments to more active UN participation; it was
                    bureaucratic inertia. I would make one exception to this generalization: the
                    ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) was enormously energetic and
                    helpful and the embassy built a good relationship with it.</p>
                <p>Many, many NGO's also set up shop in Thailand, most of which were useful. The IRC
                    (International Rescue Committee) created a Citizens' Commission on Indochinese
                    refugees; it sponsored a march to the Cambodian border to highlight the
                    refugees' plight; and sponsored trips to refugee camps by Joan Baez and Winston
                    Churchill, Jr. So the plight was increasingly dramatized and that further
                    heightened the world's concern for these refugees.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>One of the many highlights of this story was the establishment of the first
                    refugee camp under the management of the UNHCR at Sakeo. The first UNHCR camp
                    leader was Mark Malloy Brown, who went on to much greater things. Unlike some of
                    his colleagues he was a dynamo and only 26 or so. When the Khmer Rouge fled
                    before the Vietnam attack we established a camp for the dependents of the Khmer
                    Rouge, who were arriving in Thailand half starving, and in terrible shape. This
                    was the camp that Mrs. Carter visited, the only one then around. She spent the
                    day there and, as I said, helped transform the American view of the refugee
                    problem. The visit itself was prepared in two or three days. I got a call on a
                    Thursday, I think, telling me that Mrs. Carter wanted to come and visit
                    refugees. She arrived in Thailand on Sunday, I think.</p>
                <p>The Sakeo refugees were truly in terrible shape and thus aroused enormous
                    sympathy. They had left their homes without anything and depended for survival
                    on the bits that others gave them. They had few friends.</p>
                <p>The NGOs represented many national and international efforts and were enormously
                    helpful. This is the kind of challenge for which NGOs are createlarge disasters
                    requiring major assistance. One of the NGOs established a feeding station from
                    which Cambodian farmers would come from as much as 50-60 miles to get seeds as
                    well as some food. The embassy helped enlarge this project because it was
                    obviously serving at least two good goals. Numerous other NGO activities could
                    be cited. The embassy had an excellent, dedicated, staff working on refugee
                    problems; it can be proud of its accomplishment. We had a large processing unit
                    for those wanting to come to the U.S. and a sizeable refugee protection
                    unit.</p>
                <p>Lionel Rosenblatt, who led the refugee section was incredible, a real dynamo on
                    this disaster. He would call me from a remote area to report that one refugee
                    was being mistreated, or being pushed back; he wanted me to call the foreign
                    minister immediately to correct the situation. Lionel devoted his life and soul
                    to these refugees. He had that unique ability to care as much for one as for a
                    thousand.</p>
                <p>There were constant debates on the number of refugees that might be coming. We
                    consistently tried to estimate that population, but the ever changing refugee
                    flow made it hard. My attitude was to err on side of over-estimation both in
                    providing basic goods and preparing for them in Thailand. If it didn't turn out
                    to be so big, then we might have some surplus food; on the other hand,
                    under-estimation could be a major human disaster.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>I was pleased with the embassy performance. There may a few “snipers” who might
                    have had some minor disagreements with our efforts, but I think by and large the
                    embassy helped save a huge population. I was personally criticized for a number
                    of things; for example, of undermining the new Vietnamese created Cambodian
                    government because our assistance went directly to the refugees near the border,
                    and not through the new Cambodian puppet government in Phnom Penh. Father Ted
                    Hesburgh of Notre Dame denounced me for conducting a “covert” war using
                    humanitarian means to undermine another government. The British press was led by
                    John Pilcher, often negative, and saw our efforts as trying to re-fight the
                    Vietnam War. I had on my staff an employee, who was accused of being the leader
                    of a covert action under the disguise of a humanitarian program. On the other
                    hand, I received much more support, which drowned out the negative comments.</p>
                <p>The refugee challenge for two years became the concern of all embassy sections.
                    My wife spent a huge amount of time with refugees on the border and mobilizing
                    the American community in Bangkok. She had good rapport with the NGOs, many of
                    which were familiar to her through her work with the IRC. All of the embassy
                    sections pitched in and it became the basic core of our effort. There was some
                    criticism, particularly from the American business community, which felt that I
                    was paying too much attention to the refugees and not enough to their problems.
                    They felt that our other interests in Thailand were being neglected because of
                    the refugee problem. I thought that I was giving the other issues adequate time,
                    but obviously not as much as some people would have liked.</p>
                <p>Many of our officers got personally involved trying to assist refugees. It was
                    the only way our efforts could be successful. I felt some moral compulsion, but
                    even more importantly it was clear that without the ambassador's personal
                    imprimatur the efforts could not have been as successful as they had to be.
                    There may have been other ways to organize our effort, but I chose one which
                    called for much of my personal time and attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>By the time I left the post, we had an effective refugee program. The refugee
                    numbers had stabilized. There were always problems related to re-settlement, but
                    the U.S. had taken major steps to ameliorate those. One of my major internal
                    embassy problems was with INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service), which
                    was responsible for processing applicants for entrance into the U.S. INS was
                    turning down large numbers of Khmer applicants. Under the parole program,
                    applicants would be processed by INS in Bangkok and then if approved their
                    papers were sent to Washington. INS was finding all sorts of reasons to turn
                    down applicants. So one day, I went to the processing unit and spent the day
                    processing some cases devoting my time mostly to those applicants who had been
                    rejected by INS. The more I talked to these refugees, the more upset I became. I
                    thought INS was way off base and rigid in their approach to determining who was
                    a refugee and who was an economic migrant. I sent a cable to the State
                    Department and the Attorney General asking that the guidelines given INS
                    processors be changed to allow for more flexibility. On my next trip to
                    Washington, I had a meeting with the Attorney General, Smith; he was very
                    helpful. I also had a meeting with the associate attorney general, Rudy
                    Giuliani, who also was very concerned. He was actually the No.3 man in the
                    Justice Department responsible for some of the more politically sensitive
                    programs of that department. We got changes in the guidance to the INS field
                    operators, which opened the doors for a greater number of approvals. The local
                    INS representative was not pleased with my activities.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, I had a great staff, totally committed to help the Indochinese
                    refugees as best they can. Our political section was also a very good one, as
                    later confirmed by the fact that almost that entire staff became ambassadors.
                    The economic section was not quite on the same level, but it performed
                    adequately.</p>
                <p>When I left Thailand, the refugee problem was still large and much more had to be
                    done. But I was satisfied that the embassy had made a big difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interested in your view that even after our
                        withdrawal from Vietnam, we still had considerable influence in South-east
                        Asia. Could you expand on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: After conquering South Vietnam, Hanoi did not try to expand its
                    influence beyond their borders, at least in the period following our withdrawal.
                    The predictions of the “dominos falling” just didn't happen; the Vietnamese did
                    not try to spread their communism in the area except in support of the Thai
                    communist insurgents. Secondly, we were in continual touch with the Chinese,
                    who, as I said earlier, were quite wary of the Vietnamese. China also cut back
                    on its support of insurgents. Third, the countries in the area adjusted well to
                    the new situatioe.g., the Thais normalized relations with the Chinese, which
                    have boomed ever since. At the same time, we drew closer to Thailand with the
                    expansion of our assistance programs, new defense programs, and our massive
                    resettlement efforts. We tried through our diplomatic efforts to make clear as
                    best we could that our withdrawal from Vietnam did not signal a diminution of
                    our interest in the region. Certainly our deep involvement in the refugee
                    situation was a significant boost to our influence.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the major reason we did not lose much influence in the area was that
                    Southeast Asia countries did not notice much difference in the political
                    situation in the region even after we left Vietnam. Both China and Vietnam were
                    internally absorbed after Vietnam fell. They concluded that the United States
                    was still a major power with resources and capabilities that were of interest to
                    them. In fact, thanks to the Chinese-Vietnamese split, the Thais managed to get
                    rid of their own communist insurgents. So what little did change that did occur
                    was mostly positive for the Thais particularly. Moreover, the Vietnam legacy and
                    tremendous American expenditures contributed to rapid growth in the whole area.
                    The “gloom and doom” predictions about the consequences of our withdrawal from
                    Vietnam were flatly wrong.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that were not occasions when a Thai official would mention our
                    Vietnam experience. But by the time I arrived in Bangkok, three years had passed
                    since our withdrawal. Although the Thais wanted our assistance especially
                    against the Vietnamese incursions from Cambodia, they were careful to maintain
                    good relations with us and their neighbors, particularly China. We had a cozy
                    relationship with the Thai military for many years, paying with military
                    assistance. By the late 1970's that exchange was no longer adequate. We still
                    had a good relationship, but a new foundation had to be developed. Both the
                    Thais and we had moved on. We both had also normalized relations with China, the
                    Thai much more quickly.</p>
                <p>It is true that the Thais, when I reached Bangkok, were encouraging us to be more
                    proactive in getting the Vietnamese out of the areas they had occupied close to
                    their borders. We were focused on the refugee problem and the involvement of
                    ASEAN in assisting the refugees, and most important for Thailand, reversing
                    Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. They still viewed us as the power in the area
                    and I guess the American ambassador continued to be seen by many Thais as the
                    man who pulled the levers behind the scenes. This perception was facilitated in
                    part to the uneasiness of the Thai Foreign Ministry in the late 1970's until
                    some major personnel changes occurred.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>In 1992, Peter Tarnoff, Dick Holbrooke, and I visited Vietnam, Cambodia and
                    Thailand. We engaged senior officials on the question of the Khmer Rouge and
                    what might be done about getting rid of them. I was rather strident on it. One
                    senior Thai Foreign Ministry official turned tome and said: “Mort, things have
                    changed in this region. There are no more American pro-consuls here.” He was
                    right; life had changed since my days in Thailand and the countries of the
                    region were far more independent than they had been in my days. The relationship
                    between Thailand and the U.S. has moved far beyond the 1960's and 1970's and
                    even the 1990's. That is all to the good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that Mrs. Carter came to Thailand . Did you
                        have a lot of visitors who wanted to see the refugee camps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: As I mentioned earlier, I think we hosted about 300 members of
                    Congress during the three years I was ambassador. The refugee situation
                    attracted wide Congressional attention and involvement. It was a big deathe
                    starving Cambodians, the Vietnamese boat people, the Lao Hmong who were our
                    allies, etc. It was also a fertile area for some good media reporting. All this
                    helped produce wide support in Congress and among the American population in
                    general for the Indochina refugee program.</p>
                <p>I rarely met a member of Congress who did not strongly support American efforts.
                    We received adequate financial support for our refugee assistance and
                    re-settlement programs. President Carter's opening the doors to the U.S. for
                    164,000 refugees for two yeara total of 328,000 was un-precedent and it is still
                    a high-water mark in our refugee admission programs. He didn't have any major
                    opposition in Congress for the unique program.</p>
                <p>Our earliest visitors were Senators Danforth, Baucus and Sasser. We took them to
                    the border and let them see the concentration of Cambodians. We showed them
                    where we wanted to provide assistance. They returned to Washington and became
                    real advocates for our requests. I remember Danforth saying to me that, besides
                    his marriage, his efforts in behalf of Indochinese refugees was the most
                    important thing he had done in his public life. As an ordained minister, he was
                    overwhelmed by the desperation of the humans huddled together in camps on the
                    Thai border.</p>
                <p>In fact the outpouring of pro-refugee sentiment attracted many visitors to
                    Thailand. I became sort of a tour guide for American officials and private
                    citizens. If it was a small group, they stayed in my guest house; the larger
                    groups had to stay in hotels. But I went with most of them to the border; I
                    always briefed them on the Thai situation. I spent a lot of time with visitors.
                    When I would return to Washington, I would call on some of them, particularly
                    those who were so helpful to us. One of those was Congressman Steve Solarz, who
                    remained actively involved. Another was Senator Barbara Mikulski. And there were
                    numerous others. I appreciated all of the help we got.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that CBS wanted to film a special report on what an American
                    embassy did day in and day out. Secretary Vance decided that the embassy in
                    Bangkok would be a fine example. Ed Bradley and his crew spent about two weeks
                    with us. They went to the border and held interviews with the refugees and the
                    NGOs working there. The show was televised on a Saturday night at 10:00 p.m. not
                    a time to attract many viewers regardless of the subject. It did not get high
                    ratings, although I was told that it was still seen by some 4 million
                    people.</p>
                <p>There is one other story about my tour that maybe of interest. After the election
                    of Ronald Reagan, I was invited to participate in a conference in Ditchley,
                    England in November 1980. One the way there, my wife and I stopped in Athens to
                    see Bob McCloskey, then our ambassador to Greece. We stayed with him. The day
                    after we arriveor two daySheppie and I walked to buy a copy of The Harald
                    Tribune (European edition). On the front page, there was a big headline: “Two
                    envoys to be removed by new administration.” The story was that Bill Gleysteen,
                    then in Korea, and I were targeted for replacement. The information apparently
                    came from Ray Cline who allegedly was representing the incoming administration
                    on East Asia and had given an interview while in Singapore. He may also have
                    visited Bangkok before giving the interview, but I am not certain about that.
                    Needless to say, The Herald Tribune story came as a bolt out of the blue,
                    particularly since, as I have mentioned, I had recommended Ray to Elliot
                    Richardson when he was looking for an INR director. It brought back all the
                    trouble I had over the Korean troop withdrawal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about the internal Thai political
                        situation. Was the country politically stable during your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Thailand had had a communist insurgency for a number of years, but by
                    the time I arrived it was fadinI might even say that it had faded. The Vietnam
                    War was over which was a major factor, because there had always been a debate
                    whether the insurgency in Thailand was a purely domestic affair or whether the
                    Vietnamese or the Chinese had inspired it. Moreover Sino-Vietnamese tensions
                    erupted. Whatever the origins, the support of either of these two countries
                    became minimal by 1978. By 1980, the Thai communist insurgency was over.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Thailand did have a problem with its Muslim population. It was not a major issue
                    then, but more like a thorn in the side. There was a small liberation movement,
                    in the three southern provinces getting some support from Malaysia. There was an
                    occasional murder and infrequent violence. At that point the Thai considered it
                    more a nuisance than a real problem. It should have been viewed as a portent of
                    a more powerful movement if the situation in the late 1970s and 1980s were not
                    dealt with adequately. Today, the Muslim independence movement is a very serious
                    challenge with thousands of lives lost. During my tour, the Muslims were seen by
                    the Thai as a matter to be monitored but not of great concern. I discussed the
                    issue with the Thai government occasionally to encourage it to take steps to
                    minimize the Muslims' unrest. I visited the area both to show our interest in
                    the issue to deal with the question of Thai attacks on fleeing Vietnamese boat
                    people, but we never took any action. The Thais unfortunately did neglect the
                    rising tide of anger, which now has turned into almost a tidal wave. The Thais
                    were very shortsighted on this issue and still don't know how to deal with this
                    insurgency.</p>
                <p>As for the political situation, I arrived soon after a coup had taken place. A
                    military-led government had taken power. Eventually, there were elections and a
                    new constitution was written. The prime minister when I arrived was General
                    Kriangsak. He tried to run a government, while finding ways to satisfy the
                    various competing factions in the military as well as pleasing the palace. There
                    was no question that the military ran the government despite some gestures
                    toward democracy, such as civilizing the prime minister. It was still a civilian
                    government dominated by the military. The constitution was written to assure
                    that the military had a major say over policy, for example, a certain number of
                    seats in the parliament was reserved for military officers. The King was a major
                    player, behind the curtains; he provided a calming conservative view. He tried
                    to insure that there would be no violence among the military. Stability was his
                    principal concern.</p>
                <p>The push for “democracy” was not central to U.S. foreign policy as today. I did a
                    small amount of preaching with a variety of Thais and occasionally the prime
                    minister. I think it is fair to say that despite the military-run government,
                    the Thais were inching their way to a more open society. The government did
                    focus on important issues such as economic development, agricultural
                    improvement, etc. They had a long way to go, but they were starting to move in
                    the right direction and the country was beginning to take off. The regime was
                    not oppressive; it lacked a process which would allow the voice of the people to
                    be heard by the policy makers. The newspapers were fairly free; there were
                    elections; there was a constitution. I would describe it as a relaxed, somewhat
                    authoritarian government. There had been so many coups in Thailand. While we
                    opposed the military did what they wanted. We were concerned in minimizing
                    violence and in being able to continue to provide refugee assistance to
                    Thailand. Like many others, we were also interested in maintaining a stable
                    South East Asia, urging regional cooperation primarily through ASEAN. As I said
                    before, the biggest boost for an expanded ASEAN regional role was the Cambodian
                    war.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>The U.S. government wanted to see more democratic development but it was not a
                    major concern because 1) there had been a war in a neighboring country and 2)
                    the region was still not stable particularly when the refugee flow became a
                    flood, nor was Thailand a totalitarian country. The region needed a stable
                    Thailand, sympathetic to the plight of the Indochinese refugees and willing to
                    assist in a humanitarian effort.</p>
                <p>Many Thai officers had been trained in the United States or by Americans in
                    Thailand. One of the interesting aspects of Thailand is the quality of its
                    civilian government officials. Half of them had PhDs from American universities;
                    they had a higher level of competence in some areas than would be found in many
                    other governments including ours. The extent of the influence of American
                    education was the presence of some 200,000 graduates of U.S, higher education
                    facilities in the Thai work force in the late 1970's. Thailand placed a priority
                    on higher level education. For a child to go to the U.S. to attend universities
                    and colleges was the goal of every Thai parent. Our long relationship with the
                    Thai military fit their need. The U.S. trained them, we were there when needed,
                    they joined us in Vietnam. A close relationship developed between the two
                    military institutions, which was slightly damaged by our withdrawal from Vietnam
                    and our subsequent relinquishment of almost all of our bases in Thailand. But
                    none of our actions in South East Asia had changed fundamentally the
                    military-to-military relationship in my time.</p>
                <p>Let me finish my discussion about our relationships with the Thai military during
                    my time there. They wanted us for three reasons: 1) to provide insurance for
                    Thai independence; 2) to provide American military equipment; and 3) to preserve
                    ties between members of our two military forces, forged during training in the
                    U.S. as well by service by U.S. officers in Thailand. Our relationships with the
                    Thai military were thus close, but so close that we could be and were charged
                    with interfering in Thai politics.</p>
                <p>There were close ties between the military and the king. Mrs. Carter came to
                    Thailand to emphasize our concern for Indochinese refugees. The prime minister
                    assigned the Army's commander-in-chief to be her escort while she was in
                    Thailand. We visited several camps along the Thai-Cambodian border. Mrs. Carter
                    stopped periodically to talk to the refugees. The general became quite nervous
                    because the most important assignment to him was to insure that Mrs. Carter not
                    be late for her appointment with the King. That was all he cared about. He kept
                    urging me: “We got to move! We got to move!” Mrs. Carter was most interested in
                    getting a feel for the situation and the condition of the refugees. I use this
                    vignette just to make the point that the commander-in-chief of the Army, as well
                    as most of his colleagues and staff were devote royalists. The King is, of
                    course, highly revered in the country.</p>

                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The Thai military focused on one issue after the Vietnamese
                    approached the border of Thailand. They constantly stated their fear of a
                    Vietnamese invasion. The Thai prime minister asked me to come to see him early
                    on and to convey to Washington how seriously the Thai viewed the situation; he
                    said if the Vietnamese forces continued moving towards the border, the Thais
                    would invade Cambodia. I was skeptical about that threat; I don't know that the
                    Thais had an adequate force ready for such an undertaking, but I warned
                    Washington of the prime minister's threat. I tried to calm the Thais down lest
                    they proceed with actions for which they might be severely hurt. The Vietnamese
                    continued to occasionally bomb some refugee groups but stopped their advance
                    toward Thailand. An invasion of Thailand was not on the Vietnamese agenda. I
                    understood the Thais' concerns and might have had the same attitude if I had
                    been in their situation, but objectively, I could not envisage a Vietnamese
                    invasion of Thailand.</p>
                <p>In part to bolster Thais military confidence and to assure continued unfettered
                    U.S. access to the border and refugee areas, I was always trying to find ways to
                    increase our military assistance program. General Prem, the commander in chief
                    of the Army, was determined to get more tanks for his soldiers. I was willing to
                    go along as long as our requirements were met and General Prem was key. I made a
                    major effort to get these tanks. After a couple of months of nothing, I finally
                    sent a cable to Mike Armacost, who was in the Pentagon in my old job. I told
                    Mike that I had an appointment with the General to discuss a variety of matters,
                    but that I knew that the first question he would have would be the status of his
                    request for tanks. I asked Mike what I should say. Do I stick to our usual line
                    that they “were on their way”, or do I tell him the truth. I ended the message
                    by insisting that they be shipped immediately. The message was a little sterner
                    than what I have described here, but in any event, it produced results and I
                    could tell the General truthfully that the tanks were to be loaded on a ship and
                    sent on their way.</p>
                <p>Getting “surplus” hardware from the American military was almost always a
                    struggle. The tanks that the Thais wanted were not surplus and came directly out
                    of our inventory. The army was unhappy. I ran into a similar situation when I
                    was involved in the issue of sending “Stingers” to the Afghan mujahideen in
                    1986-87. Our military objected because the transfer of these weapons to the
                    Afghan would reduce our stock of “Stingers” below the numbers determined to be
                    needed for our own defensive purposes. That issue created a major policy dispute
                    which was resolved by Fred Ikl�'s intervention at DoD. In the late 1970's, the
                    military had established a level of tank requirements which it was reluctant to
                    diminish.</p>
                <p>The tanks did arrive in two or three shipments. Every time one of the shipments
                    was unloaded, we held a public celebration. We may have in fact held ceremonies
                    both at dock-side and when they were officially turned over to the Thais. We
                    milked the public relations potential of these shipments until the milk ran
                    dry.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I frequently asked for military hardware. We had a small MAAG unit which was
                    helpful in getting the hardware. I must say that I felt several times that I was
                    not clear what the MAAand the CIwere up to. AID was no problem in this respect;
                    I knew their program well and it was totally transparent. The economic
                    assistance program was small; I tried to get it increased partly because the
                    king would on occasions ask for help for his agricultural activities. I viewed
                    our economic assistance program not as a major force in the Thai economic
                    development, but as a stimulant for some specific economic efforts which I felt
                    were useful for the country. The total economic assistance program was just not
                    large enough to be a major factor, about $25 million. I don't think we could
                    have made a good case for a sizeable increase.</p>
                <p>Both economic and military assistance were for me at this time essentially
                    functional tools for other purposes. The Thai military initially had a
                    perception problem; they saw threats that were not evident to me or to most
                    outside observers. They did have a legitimate concern about the Vietnamese
                    massed on their borders; that could be viewed as a threat. The economic
                    assistance program in certain regions allowed us to have some impact on economic
                    development of that region. But I also viewed it more as a tool to influence
                    Thai actions on other matters of real concern to the U.S.</p>
                <p>The aid programs helped achieve some broad policy goals. Both programs had
                    inherent merits, but they were important but not essential for either Thai
                    military or economic development; they were important to us reaching our
                    objectives.</p>
                <p>I should mention that my relationship with the CIA station chief and headquarters
                    ultimately came back to haunt me. But that happened after I left Thailand. Dan
                    Arnold was the station chief in Bangkok. I accepted his appointment even though
                    I had been advised by Dick Sneider to shun him. Sneider, for whom Arnold had
                    worked in Korea, had had a lot of trouble with Arnold. I really didn't know
                    Arnold and despite his reputation, I decided to accept his assignment because I
                    don't like to reject people I don't know personally. I thought Arnold did a
                    decent job in Thailand; we seemed to work well together and he consulted with me
                    frequently. I thought I knew what the station was involved in, but I could never
                    be sure; there may well have been some activities in Cambodia with the Khmer
                    Rouge about which I was never informed. As Arnold was due for reassignment, he
                    asked for my assistance; his reputation in Washington was poor and he was
                    concerned about his next job. I did try to help him, but he did not get the job
                    at headquarters that he wanted. After his departure from post, I read in an
                    intelligence report that Arnold was returning to Bangkok to be an advisor to the
                    Thai government on intelligence matters. That blew my mind; I thought it was
                    outrageous, not to mention very risky for our own intelligence efforts. As it
                    turned out, the Arnold role was greatly overstated in the intelligence report.
                    He did come to see me to describe his duties. Nevertheless, I was quite negative
                    about the whole situation and said so in plain English. My attitude probably
                    poisoned our relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I returned to Washington about a month after a military coup in Thailand. I might
                    parenthetically add that the embassy handled that coup well. I had left Bangkok
                    for Hong Kong and returned immediately. Some military officers tried to
                    overthrow Prime Minister Prem. In a quiet way we helped the Prem government and
                    the coup was quickly resolved. Since as happens periodically officers were
                    unhappy about their promotions, etc, it was not a difficult matter to resolve.
                    General Prem returned to power and most of the rancor dissipated, at least
                    overtly.</p>
                <p>I have an amusing story on this coup. The general leading the coup had returned
                    from Burma and was pardoned. I was at a party and talked to the supreme
                    commander, General Saiyut and the Korean military attache. I asked the attach�,
                    with some malice, whether the Korean military, under similar circumstances,
                    would allow a coup leader to return to Korea a free man. The answer was direct:
                    we would hang him if he returned. I then asked General Saiyut what his views
                    were of the Korean approach. He smiled and said, “Mort, It doesn't snow in
                    Thailand.” I used that phrase as a heading for a piece for Newsweek magazine on
                    another coup in Thailand in 1992.</p>
                <p>Let me go back to the Arnold story. When I returned from Thailand, I thought I
                    had a pretty good reputation as someone who could handle crises. But I knew that
                    the conservatives in Washington were after my scalp, primarily stimulated by
                    Arnold and another one of my detractors; Dick Stillwell, who, as I mentioned,
                    thought I was responsible for the Carter decision to withdraw our troops from
                    Korea and who also mistrusted me because I had worked for Admiral Gayler, whom
                    he detested. When I returned in 1981, six months after the new administration
                    had taken power, I did not know what my next assignment might be. Dick Kennedy,
                    then the Undersecretary of State for Management, told me that Secretary Haig
                    wanted me to be his Assistant Secretary for East Asia. I readily agreed; it was
                    a job I really wanted. I had met Haig briefly at a chief of mission conference,
                    which was in part devoted to griping about the “Troika” (Meese, Deaver and
                    Baker) who were interfering in foreign affairs. I had also known Haig slightly
                    when I was working for Richardson and he was at the NSC as Kissinger's main
                    aide.</p>
                <p>I warned Kennedy that my nomination might be an uphill battle because there were
                    some people in town who were after my scalp. He told me not to worry; the
                    Secretary wanted me. I thought that in light of my previous connections with
                    Haig, brief as they may been, we would get along fine and I could serve him
                    well. I also asked Kennedy whether Holdridge, the then assistant secretary, had
                    been informed. The answer was: “No.” John was a good friend and I thought that
                    he should know what was being discussed. So I told John about my conversation
                    with Kennedy; he was shocked. In any case, about two weeks later, Kennedy called
                    me to tell me that there was opposition to my nomination and that the Secretary
                    had decided not to move forward with it. I would be offered another job. I
                    wasn't surprised by that turn of events; I knew here was considerable animus
                    against the nomination in some parts of the new administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>I was then offered the ambassadorship to the Philippines, while Mike Armacost was
                    chosen for Indonesia. A few weeks later, I was told that some high level people
                    at Defense objected to my assignment to Manila. DoD of course had a deep
                    interest in the Philippine job because of its major base structure in that
                    country. The main objector was the undersecretary for political affairs in
                    Donamely Dick Stillwell. So someone came up with the bright idea of just
                    switching Mike and me for the two jobs. Bill Clark, Haig's deputy secretary,
                    called me to tell me about this new development. I was still upset with the
                    whole business. I thought the way they treated me was a disgrace and that view
                    lingers still.</p>
                <p>So I went off to study Indonesian for two months. Ed Masters, our ambassador in
                    Djakarta, was instructed to telinformallthe Indonesians of my appointment. My
                    name was not unfamiliar to the Indonesians. My work in Thailand and the area in
                    general, including my tour in CINCPAC and in the Pentagon, had given me an
                    acquaintance with many senior officials. I had worked with the Indonesians on a
                    number of projects for them, especially after Vietnam fell. The Indonesians were
                    quite wary of the Vietnamese, seeing them as a threat to their own security,
                    which we tried to ease to some extent with some increase in military
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>Masters carried out his instructions, but later reported that the feedback he had
                    gotten from the Indonesians was primarily negative. Suharto didn't want me. I
                    could not understand that. After that news from Djakarta, I was ready to call it
                    quits. One close Indonesian friend, Benny Murdani, the head of Indonesian
                    intelligence and at that time, probably carried more influence with Suharto than
                    any other Indonesian official, told me not to be overly concerned and that he
                    would change the president's mind. I never heard from him, but after two months
                    or so the Department went ahead and asked for agr�ment. There was no answer to
                    that either. I finally told Haig's office that I just couldn't hang around the
                    Department without an assignment. So Haig called the Indonesian Foreign
                    Minister, who told him “the well had been poisoned.”</p>
                <p>We finally found out what the block was. Suharto had been given a memorandum
                    drafted by Ed Meese on White House stationery, which I subsequently saw courtesy
                    of Jack Anderson. The Indonesians confirmed to me that such a letter had been
                    delivered to Suharto. The memo was in essence an objection to my appointment as
                    ambassadoor perhaps any job in the Reagan administration. The old chestnut of my
                    urging withdrawal from Korea was included; it also mentioned that Sheppie had
                    worked for a democrat, Ed Muskie, and held me responsible for a long list of
                    other iniquities. That memo had been given to Suharto, allegedly by someone who
                    had his eyes on the ambassadorship to Indonesia. Obviously, the memo gave
                    Suharto much pause; why should he accept an ambassador when it appeared the
                    White House had so many doubts about him. Suharto did not know me. He was
                    relying entirely on members of our government. I certainly understood Suharto's
                    negative reaction.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I learned about all of this after the agr�ment had been withdrawn and the
                    Department sought a new assignment for me. It was clear to me that I was the
                    victim of a backroom conspiracy that succeeded. I learned later that the man who
                    gave Suharto the letter was subsequently proposed as ambassador to Indonesia.
                    The Foreign Service, led by Marshall Green, rose in indignation, partly because
                    he was not a Foreign Service officer, but more importantly because he had served
                    in Indonesia in the CIA, was a big friend of the president, and took care of his
                    son while he was in the U.S. Marshall was well aware of the man's activities in
                    Indonesia and thought the appointment was a serious mistake. In any case, the
                    Arnolds and Stillwells of this world did me in and blocked my assignment to
                    Indonesia. As I said earlier, I learned much about this from Jack Anderson; he
                    just sent me the memo after telling me on the phone that he had something which
                    might interest me. I didn't know Anderson, so I never filled out the whole story
                    for him. When he called me about the memo, it was the first time I had ever
                    talked to him.</p>
                <p>I should note that these travails took about six months. I returned from Thailand
                    in August 1981. I was supposed to be in EA till February 1982. Soon after that,
                    I received the copy of the memo from Anderson. So I was in limbo for that whole
                    period, not a happy time.</p>
                <p>In light of all this, I went to Rand for six months to do some writing. After the
                    mess that had been created in those six months, the Department was simply ready
                    to let me do anything I wanted. I was still considering retirement from the
                    Foreign Service. I may have discussed my situation with Haig once or twice; Walt
                    Stoessel, the then deputy secretary, was no help. Nor were other Seventh floor
                    principals. The sole exception was Bill Clark, Stoessel's predecessor. He
                    apparently did try to find a suitable post. I think Haig was embarrassed by the
                    whole sequence of mishandled actions. I found the Seventh floor lack of support
                    disappointing. I was also frustrated by their subsequent description of events;
                    they distorted what had happened. I had become something of a pariah. Having
                    made some real contribution in Bangkok and then offered a variety of jobs which
                    never materialized, left me amazed.</p>
                <p>I read a lot in Rand's Washington office and wrote a couple of papers. One was on
                    Cambodia which after having read, I decided not to publish it. I didn't believe
                    that it added much to the already known situation in Cambodia and its
                    neighbors.</p>
                <p>I used the time at Rand to begin conversations with various people about jobs in
                    private industry. A couple of oil companies approached me, but nothing concrete
                    was ever settled. It was a very unproductive year between the time I left
                    Thailand and my next assignment. The period at Rand let me look at my situation
                    from a more dispassionate point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>At about this time, something else happened which made me even more disappointed
                    with the Department. I was asked by an office in the Department to give a speech
                    as part of a USIA program, but then subsequently informed that the agency had in
                    effect “blacklisted” me. I was on a list of people who should not be part of any
                    USIA sponsored program in a foreign country. I, a senior State Department
                    official, was not to represent the U.S. government in any way or shape. Scott
                    Thompson, the deputy director of USIA and a friend, told me all this. It
                    apparently all went back to the Meese memo. From being considered for assistant
                    secretary to being unemployeand unemployablwas quite a plunge. Fortunately, I
                    still got paid.</p>
                <p>Soon after Shultz became Secretary of State in mid-1982, he asked me to come to
                    his office. I assumed that some people in whom he had confidence had suggested
                    that he talk to me. I didn't know Shultz at all. We talked about China mainly;
                    the meeting took about 45 minutes during which he listened carefully and made a
                    few comments; there was never any discussion about another assignment. In this
                    period our relationship with China was still rocky. Although I had not published
                    anything recently on China, I had continued to follow events closely.</p>
                <p>Sometime in this period, I talked to a number of people about China, including
                    Paul Wolfowitz, then in DoD. I think Paul may have talked to Shultz about me.
                    However there seemed to be very little movement in trying to find a job for me.
                    Rick Burt, the assistant secretary for EUR, called me to tell me that he would
                    like to nominate me to be our ambassador to Spain. That sounded pretty good to
                    me at the time, even though I knew precious little about Spain.</p>
                <p>Then, in a complete surprise to a lot of people, the administration fired all the
                    leadership of our arms control efforts, the chief U.S. delegation to the START
                    talks, the head of ACDA, and the chief of the delegation to MBFR. In one fell
                    swoop, all the leading figures on arms control were eliminated. Ken Adelman
                    became the head of ACDA. Max Kampelman became the chief of our START delegation.
                    Before all this was announced, Shultz called me and asked me to head up our
                    delegation to the MBFR negotiations.</p>
                <p>I told the Secretary that I thought I was under consideration for the
                    ambassadorship to Spain. He said that Spain was no longer available. That left
                    me little choice and I told Shultz that I needed to talk to my wife first. I
                    said I would call him the next day. The choice was really MBFR or retirement. In
                    truth, I knew a little about MBFfrom my days in the Pentagon when the
                    negotiations begaand furthermore, I never much liked long drawn out
                    multi-lateral negotiations. Sheppie urged me to accept the Secretary's offer and
                    after further reflection I accepted the assignment. I also discussed the offer
                    with some friends. I knew that the talks had become a ritualistic exercise and
                    the possibility of reaching some acceptable agreement was remote. Everybody
                    encouraged me to take it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any idea how the Secretary came to his decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I didn't know, probably that I was available and had, except in the
                    White House, a pretty decent reputation. I am sure there were people around him
                    urging him to give me another ambassadorial assignment. I also suspect that MBFR
                    did not rank very high on the Seventh Floor agenda. There was very little
                    movement in the negotiations, but increased enormously the Department's paper
                    flow. Our delegation sent volumes of cables back to Washington. I can't say that
                    I looked at the assignment with relish. In fact, later when I was the head of
                    INR, I issued instructions to my staff assistants that I wanted to see important
                    material on all subjects except: MBFR and Cyprus. Ironically, I subsequently
                    became ambassador to Turkey where I had to become quite familiar with the Cyprus
                    problem, which has also produced endless reams of paper.</p>
                <p>I guess I viewed the MBFR offer as the last opportunity to stay in the Foreign
                    Service, which I had until then enjoyed, and I decided to accept the
                    appointment. Had Sheppie advised against it, I probably would not have taken the
                    job. So in 1983, I became the head of the U.S. delegation to the MBFR with the
                    rank of ambassador. In retrospect, I am glad I stayed in the Service, although I
                    quit after a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you resigned from the MBFR assignment after a
                        year. Why so soon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The work was boring and left me quite distressed. When I took the
                    assignment, I knew about the difficulties of making progress and the lack of
                    interest in both the U.S. and Russian governments. Nevertheless, I was
                    determined to take the whole issue seriously, I quickly immersed myself in the
                    present and past situations and got up to date. The subject matter was not of
                    great interest to me; it was not one to which I could have devoted my career.
                    But I did learn as much about it as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what you did in preparation for that
                        tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: It was a new field for me and I took the assignment very seriously. I
                    tried to learn all of the arcane truth and myths surrounding the negotiations; I
                    read voluminous correspondence and lengthy treatises on the subject. If I had a
                    choice of assignments, I don't think I would have spent more than two minutes on
                    the choice. I studied hard and talked to many.</p>
                <p>One day, I went to Rick Burt to talk about some of the issues facing MBFR. Before
                    I got very far, he said: “Mort, you know more about this stuff than anyone else
                    here.” It was a big educational job on an arcane subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>When I landed in Vienna, the negotiations had long been frozen. Meetings were
                    held which were ritualistic recitals of the various positions each side had
                    maintained for years. Basically we insisted the basis of the negotiations be on
                    counting manpower and the Soviets insisting on counting armaments. We never
                    could reach agreement on that basic difference. It appeared to me that this
                    could be a lifetime job.</p>
                <p>During my tour, the situation did change somewhat. Our delegation developed a
                    proposal which gave something to the Soviets in the hopes of enticing them to
                    agree to a very small interim deal to advance the negotiations. Our proposal led
                    to two NSC meetings, both chaired by Ronald Reagan. I was the chief briefer.
                    State supported the proposal (State loves agreements by nature); DoD opposed it,
                    because essentially it was opposed to reaching any agreement with the Soviets.
                    The Pentagon was perfectly happy to carry on negotiations leading nowhere. I
                    thought our proposals protected our basic interests, while paying obeisance to
                    the situation, and making a small step forward.</p>
                <p>In the final analysis, the talks made no progress while I was the head of the
                    U.S. delegation. The process revolved around “rounds” which lasted for about
                    eight weeks. Each week started with a plenary session. Then we would consult
                    with our allies to prepare our positions for the next plenary. After each eight
                    week period, there was a hiatus of about four weeks, theoretically for each
                    government to review what had happened and to formulate its plans for the next
                    round. I used the four weeks quite fruitfully; Sheppie and I traveled through
                    many countries of central Europe. We managed to see a lot of Europe and to learn
                    about a continent with which I was not as familiar as Asia or even Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>One night during our effort to mount a new proposal, Sheppie and I went to the
                    Vienna opera. In the middle of the performance, I got a call from Ken Dam, the
                    deputy secretary of state. Or rather, Dam called the embassy who sent the duty
                    officer to the opera house to get me out. I called Dam from the opera house pay
                    phone; he wanted to me to come back immediately to Washington to discuss our new
                    proposal.</p>
                <p>During the sessions, we were busy with “make-work.” I consulted with our allies,
                    I consulted with the Soviets. There was constant social interaction. I spent a
                    lot of time just meeting with Austrian officials and foreign diplomats stationed
                    in Vienna and with visitors. I did learn one important thing about the Soviet
                    delegation. I was struck by their extraordinary feeling of inferiority when they
                    compared themselves to us and our perceived capabilities. They at least saw us
                    as “seven feet” tall, incredible omnipotent. That was a revelation.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>I never saw any hope of the MBFR negotiations coming to a successful resolution
                    or even a partial agreement. It would have taken a deus ex machina to change the
                    environment. I didn't see that happening, but in fact, it did later on, and that
                    was the end of the Soviet Union. Incidentally we changed our position on
                    conventional forces in Europe when the Berlin wall came down and the Soviet
                    Union became Russia. Both sides wanted an agreement and we adapted armaments on
                    the basis of the agreement.</p>
                <p>I developed some close friendships with members of the allied delegations, some
                    of which have continued to this day. Since the numbers of people working on MBFR
                    was rather limited, we were a small fraternity pretty much left to its own
                    devices, and we developed a close camaraderie. In the end, for me it was a
                    wasted year. As I mentioned earlier, after a year, I simply told the Department
                    I was leaving. I didn't ask for the Secretary's permission; I just told them I
                    was through with MBFR. That produced a certain amount of consternation in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>My year in Vienna was a turbulent period for me intellectually and emotionally
                    because I didn't see that I was doing much of any use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1984 you told the Secretary and the Department that
                        you were leaving the MBFR delegation. What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: My friends were not pleased with my decision and I knew that Shultz
                    was upset with me. I wanted to return to Asian affairs. I talked to Rich
                    Armitage who was then Assistant Secretary for ISA in DoD. I told him that I
                    wanted to make a survey of the region on his behalf to describe the changes I
                    found and the policy challenges the U.S. faced. Rich was an old friend, as was
                    Paul Wolfowitz, who was then the assistant secretary for the region. Rich found
                    DoD funds to pay for my travels. That enabled me to dig into something that I
                    wanted to do as well as serving their needs. It was freedom getting back to East
                    Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I traveled for about three weeks in December 1984 to Korea, Japan, China,
                    Thailand, Philippines. I didn't go to Indonesia because I was still upset with
                    Suharto and his entourage for their rejection. In the Philippines, I stayed with
                    our ambassador, Steve Bosworth, as I did in all the countries I visited, I
                    talked to numerous peoplmany of whom I had known from previous assignments and
                    who were still influential with their governments and some of the newer
                    political and business leaders. My most important finding from the trip was that
                    Marcos was finished in the Philippines, his administration was totally venal,
                    and that our task was to find a way to ease him out of the country with minimal
                    disruption. It took another eighteen months before the actual ouster, but I
                    thought it was important to start looking at accelerating it. I did not predict
                    an immediate coup, but it was clear to me that Marcos' end was in sight and that
                    we'd better plan for it. My recommendation was not received with great
                    enthusiasm, even from those whom I knew wele.g., Armacost, Wolfowitz, Armitage
                    or Bosworth. They thought it was premature and that situation was not as
                    critical as I suggested. They were certainly worried about Marcos' roll, but
                    none of them thought that one could see the light at the end of the tunnel yet.
                    It is true that I had been in the Philippines for three days, which hardly
                    buttressed by radical views. I did manage to talk to a lot of people which led
                    to my conclusions. Of course, my parthe predictiowas the easy part; the
                    difficult part was to develop a transition plan. I could see why people tended
                    to downplay my prediction. It faced them with a serious challenge. It is not
                    easy to screw around in a friend's situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After making your report, then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Mike Armacost had come to the conclusion that I would be of real help
                    in Intelligence and research (INR). He also wanted to help me. He persuaded
                    Shultz that my background and experience would be very useful in heading up that
                    bureau. In February, 1985 I became the director of INR (the job was given an
                    assistant secretary designation later that year.) Since it was not yet an
                    assistant secretary position, I did not have to go through Senate confirmation.
                    When the job was upgraded to the assistant secretary level, then I had to go
                    through Senate confirmation. I should mention that the up-grading had been in
                    the works long before I reported to INR; so that I was the beneficiary of
                    someone else's good work. The new designation did not make much difference to my
                    day-to-day operating responsibilities. But it was a useful step for the
                    Department because it gave the bureau comparable standing in the bureaucratic
                    scheme with regional and other bureaus. It may have given prospective job
                    seekers just a little more interest in the bureau. The Bureau of
                    Politico-Military Affairs was, I believe, upgraded at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>I mentioned previously that I thought INR had an excellent combination of civil
                    servants who had been in the bureau for a long time and a constant in-flow of
                    Foreign Service officers. The civil servants were, for the most part, very
                    capable and thoroughly familiar with the subject matters they handled. A few
                    were institutions. The Foreign Service officers added a field perspective and
                    many also added a good policy perspective and where intelligence analysis could
                    be helpful. This combination produced intelligence findings which were better
                    suited, in terms of substance and presentation, for a policy maker than the
                    commentaries from most other intelligence agencies, whose staffs had never been
                    in policy development positions and frequently never overseas. I think INR had a
                    blend of staff talents and experience unmatched by most other intelligence
                    agencies. That does not mean that other agencies did not have capabilities that
                    INR could not matce.g., technical competence in weapons systembut in terms of
                    analysis and of making judgments on the impact of events on policy, I thought
                    that INR was ahead of other agencies. That is not a parochial finding; others
                    have reached similar conclusions.</p>
                <p>In 1985, I was again impressed with the competence of some of the civil servants.
                    For example, Eliza Van Hollen (Chris' wife), worked on Afghanistan. I spent a
                    lot of time with her. She was absolutely indispensable to my understanding of
                    events and trends in Afghanistan. I thought she was the most knowledgeable and
                    insightful person on this subject in Washington. I was always seeking her input
                    and she came through every time. She was a gem.</p>
                <p>Recruiting Foreign Service officers for INR was a difficult task. By and large,
                    INR was viewed as a “dead end.” It was not, from their point of view, a place
                    from which one could influence policies and actions and get noticed. So I spent
                    a lot of time trying to overcome this perception. During my earlier tour, the
                    Foreign Service officers who worked for me had been there when I took over the
                    division; most were very good. But as head of the bureau, I had to keep the
                    influx of Foreign Service officers going. I can't say that I was always
                    successful, particularly in having certain officers assigned to INR, but we made
                    some progress.</p>
                <p>In both of my INR assignments, I found that the analysts had one permanent
                    approach to their tasks: they were honest. They called the situations as they
                    saw them, regardless of extraneous factors. There were a few times when I had to
                    take into consideration certain pressures that might somewhat skew the
                    inter-agency process, but that was never true of the analysts; they called the
                    shots as they saw them.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I had very good deputies. I was fortunate in that respect. Dick Clark was one of
                    them; he was a great briefer and an excellent analyst. He was also a good
                    manager with real concern for his staff. He has had a truly impressive career as
                    a civil servant. My principal deputies were first Frank McNeil followed by Curt
                    Kamman, both of whom I could count on. Jay Taylor, the last of my deputies, was
                    not always popular because he had idiosyncratic views, but he had great
                    creativity and curiosity. Mark Lowenthal, who later became an assistant director
                    in the CIA, was a stellar performer. The esprit de corps of the bureau was high.
                    We had good access to the senior officers in the Department. Of course, I had a
                    close relationship with Armacost and I would guess that at least half of our
                    work was to support Armacost in his role in leading the Department's efforts in
                    Afghanistan and the Philippineboth subjects of great interest to me as well.
                    Mike and I discussed those issueoften daily. He would send me memoranda that he
                    had received for my comments or would ask one of his staff to call me for my or
                    INR input.</p>
                <p>We also spent considerable time trying to backstop the Secretary. He and Armacost
                    were our main customers, although we also did some work for deputy secretary
                    John Whitehead. INR had always produced a “Morning Summary” which capsulated
                    events that had taken place during the night. It was a widely read document; it
                    was brief and to the point and tailor-made for busy senior policy makers.
                    Sometimes, we were even irreverent. One time, Secretary Baker indicated we might
                    have gone too far when we headlined one of our articles “Who flung Deng?”</p>
                <p>Shultz used our products. That access was useful also for enhancing INR standing
                    in the bureaucracy. When I took the INR job, I asked the Secretary for three
                    things: 1) access to him on matters which I considered important; 2) copies of
                    the daily schedules of all the Seventh Floor principals so that I could know
                    what issues they were likely to face each day; and 3) standing invitation to
                    participate in his staff meetings. These accesses differentiated INR from other
                    intelligence agencies; we were part of a policy development agency. In that way
                    our input could be more relevant to the policy maker since we generally knew
                    what was on his mind and where he was coming from. This is not to diminish the
                    importance of CIA's input, for example. It covered most of the issues that INR
                    did, but its input was rarely as timely as ours. Sometimes of course, another
                    agency might have information that we had not yet gotten or its analysis might
                    have been better that ours, but we were better able to tailor our product to the
                    daily needs of the policy maker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there has been a prevailing view in the Department
                        that a bureau's influence depended in great part on the assistant
                        secretary's access to the Secretary and his chief deputies. Do you share
                        that view?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: That is of course a very important factor, particularly for a bureau
                    with no policy responsibility. It was a determinant of the cogency of our
                    analysis and the morale of our staff. INR's influence on the rest of the
                    Department certainly was in part determined by the relationships that the
                    director had with the Secretare.g., Bill Hyland with Henry Kissinger. Of course,
                    Bill's charter went beyond that of a normal INR director because he was also one
                    of his key advisors on Soviet affairs. Hal Saunders was an influential INR
                    director in part because of his expertise on Middle East affairs. Ray Cline, on
                    the other hand, had very little influence either on the Seventh Floor or in the
                    rest of the Department.</p>
                <p>So access to the Secretary was critical. As you suggested, that is a principle of
                    management that governed the operations of the Department. But I think we must
                    add that access was not enough; the bureau had to have a product or ideas that
                    were well thought out and had a logic to it, that it had something useful to
                    say; dumb ideas usually did not get very far regardless of a bureau chief's
                    access. Of course, there were bureaus that had very good products or ideas which
                    would not be adopted for many reasons, not only perfunctory access to the
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>There is however another side to this picture to which I can speak from personal
                    experience. For example, if there was an issue related to terrorism. INR was
                    well situated to know quickly what terrorists were doing, primarily from
                    intercepts of their communications. As quickly as possible we would write a
                    briefing memo to pass on what we had learned and put the information into a
                    current policy context. Our ability to put information together briefly and
                    quickly helped improve INR's reputation on the Seventh Floor. No other bureau in
                    the building could provide a package so quickly which combined intelligence
                    information with thoughtful analysis relevant to a current policy issue. We
                    often had such analysis on a principal's desk within an hour or two of having
                    received it.</p>
                <p>Not only were these analyses valuable to the decision makers, but particularly in
                    the case of Armacost and sometimes Shultz, they would return the memos with
                    their notations which gave us useful insights in their interests and policy
                    approaches and suggested further analysis. The staff appreciated these notes
                    because it made them feel that they were producing something beyond papers; they
                    were actually contributing something to policy development at the highest level
                    of the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I have mentioned the desirability of access to the principals. This is not to say
                    that their staffs were not also tremendously useful. As I mentioned during my
                    description of my earlier tour in INR/EA, a principal's staff can be enormously
                    helpful to resolving one issue or another. As director of INR, I did not use
                    them as often as previously because I had so many more contacts with the
                    principals. But the personal staffs were still very important to us and we would
                    save a lot of time using them to pass on questions or views to their principals
                    rather than trying to deal directly with the Secretary or an undersecretary. In
                    addition, these personal staffs knew that we welcomed their participation and
                    would come to our offices for briefings or discussions on subjects in which they
                    were currently involved. So, although I personally may not have dealt with them
                    as often as I did when I was INR/EA, they were very useful and INR maintained
                    close contacts with them. In fact, Marc Grossman was the Deputy Secretary's
                    special assistant; that is how I got to know him and subsequently asked him to
                    be DCM in Turkeeven though he was far too junior for the position according to
                    the Department's organizational charts.</p>
                <p>Let me just briefly talk a little about what I considered to be a major problem
                    of the Reagan administratiowhich I believe exists in the Bush II administration.
                    I am referring to the adequacy of intelligence collection and analysis and the
                    perceived politicalization of intelligence. It was a fact in the Reagan days,
                    particularly in the CIA. It may not have been as dire as some claim, but
                    politicization certainly did go on particularly under Bill Casey. Casey was
                    action-oriented and he wanted to destroy the Soviet Union. He was a very
                    interesting man; I liked dealing with him because he had ideas and dedication to
                    doing things. He may at times have been out of step with reality, particularly
                    toward the end of his life, but he gave issues considerable thought. Shultz
                    became very unhappy with Casey as time went by. He thought that CIA's output on
                    some issues was more political propaganda than basic analysis. Its product was
                    criticized more and more as time passed. He lost a lot of trust in Casey and I
                    think legitimately so. In addition, there was a feeling that the agency's covert
                    activities were limiting the leadership's time for focusing on improving
                    intelligence analysis. In Bush II this concern seemed very prominent, but I am
                    no longer close to the subject.</p>
                <p>As many historians have written, covert actions were often driven not by CIA but
                    by our political leadership. Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy,
                    all apparently felt that if there was a “bad” government in some foreign
                    country, let's get rid of it! That point of view, I think, became and remained
                    the agency's major concern for a long time. The political leadership's demand on
                    the agency was far greater than could be delivered. In my period, it was the
                    Iran-Contra operation that resulted from a push from the “top.” The only
                    significant difference from operations previously dictated by the political
                    leadership was that in the 1980's, the agency was led by a willing
                    co-conspirator, Bill Casey.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>I might also mention that the director of INR is the Department's point man to
                    prepare the principals to participate in the USG's “covert action” committee
                    which must pass on all covert action proposals. I was not the Department's
                    representative on this committee but I went with our principal to help him as
                    needed. Most of the meetings were at the undersecretary level where Mike
                    Armacost represented State. The Secretary and Deputies and Armacost and one of
                    my staff, perhaps a regional assistant secretary and I were the only people in
                    State with access to covert action plans and programs. One of my deputies was in
                    charge of the day-to-day activities as well as for relationships with other
                    intelligence agencies. There were specific issues, such as transfer of Stinger
                    weapons to the mujahideen, in which the relevant regional bureau was heavily
                    involved. Although knowledge of covert actions was known by a number of people
                    in the Department, it was obviously not a widely discussed activity. On rare
                    occasions, INR would receive extremely sensitive information which I would
                    personally take to Armacost leaving to them the decision of whether they wanted
                    other people informed. There were occasions during the Iran-Contra process, when
                    a Seventh Floor principal might be briefed by NSA Director Bill Odom, but I
                    would not. Iran-Contra was handled outside the normal governmental processes; I
                    was not made aware of the activity until I was reading FBIS and learning of
                    McFarland's ties to Iran. Iran-Contra was as far as I know the sole exception to
                    the normal processes in my experience. The standard procedure was that INR would
                    prepare the Department's principal for his meeting of the “covert actions”
                    committee usually in cooperation with the relevant regional bureau.</p>
                <p>INR thus served both as the intelligence information transmission belt from and
                    to intelligence agencies and the lead bureau in the Department to represent the
                    Secretary's views on specific covert action proposals. That, some purists would
                    say, gave INR a role, limited as it might have been, in the policy development
                    process of the USG. It did.</p>
                <p>During my time, Afghanistan was the major issue giving INR a voice in policy
                    making. I became not an insignificant player in a huge bureaucratic battle in
                    Washington. Much of the bureaucratic battle is described in George Crile's book
                    Charlie Wilson's War and in a Kennedy School memorandum. The issue was how to
                    help the Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion.</p>
                <p>Shultz used to have weekly meetings of senior officials-assistant secretary of
                    State, DoD and NSC every other Saturday morning. It was effectively something of
                    an inter-agency bull session. During the summer of 1985, the Secretary convened
                    a meeting on Afghanistan. I started the discussion with a briefing which was
                    very pessimistic about the likely outcome of the fight against the Soviets. The
                    Soviets had introduced new arms and new forces which would decimate the
                    insurgents as well as the local population. They were making progress against
                    the mujahideen. When I heard that Rich Armitage, the deputy secretary, was going
                    to Pakistan, I asked whether I could join his group. He said “Sure.” This was an
                    opportunity to get into Pakistan without fanfare and to roam around relatively
                    unfettered to meet Pakistan intelligence which was running the war and CIA and
                    the leading Afghan insurgents.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I took the trip to Pakistan because I was concerned that the mujahideen were
                    losing their war in Afghanistan. It was clear that Soviet air superiority,
                    particularly introduction of Speznaz and more helicopters, was taking its toll,
                    and that is the main reason I supported the transfer of the Stingers to the
                    mujahideen. Some counter measures were absolutely essential if the Soviets were
                    ever to withdraw from Afghanistan. That was the U.S. government's objective
                    which I fully supported.</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier about the debate within the government about providing the
                    Stingers to the insurgents. The debate was not whether we wanted the Soviets out
                    of Afghanistan; everyone in Washington agreed with that. The issue was whether
                    the Stinger was the right weapon system and whether the U.S. military could
                    afford to transfer some of those weapons.</p>
                <p>I spent two or three days there. I talked to some mujahideen, I talked to the our
                    station chief, I talked to the Paks. I was trying to get some first hand
                    information about the progress of the insurgency. I was particularly interested
                    in the CIA's views about the mujahideen's needs for better weapons, particularly
                    ground-to-air missiles to offset Soviet air power. I had tentatively reached the
                    conclusion that more of these anti-aircraft weapons were needed, but I was
                    looking for confirmation. While the mujahideen had British blowpipes, they had
                    limited effect against higher flying aircraft. My conversations and briefings
                    reinforced my view that “Stinger” missiles were desperately needed and had to be
                    supplied or the “Muj” would be severely hurt. The station chief told me that
                    “Washington” was reluctant to provide these weapons. The alleged concern was
                    that the mujahideen's use of these weapons would identify the U.S. as directly
                    providing weapons to the insurgents. That was indeed a case made in parts of
                    State and CIA. I though this was a spurious argument since by this time, the
                    Soviets were well aware of our growing massive support for the mujahideen. Other
                    objectors pointed to Pakistan taking opposition.</p>
                <p>In any case, I became a proponent of taking action. I felt that we had to do
                    something to help the mujahideen against Russian airpower. I must admit that my
                    stance did obliterate the distinction between intelligence collection and
                    analysis and policy making. It was undoubtedly unusual for the director of INR
                    to become so deeply involved in a debate on policy. In part, I was placed in
                    this position because I was the principal State representative on covert action
                    programs. I became involved in part because my job in fact demanded it.</p>
                <p>There were two people in particular whom were equally supportive of Stingers in
                    the Pentagon: Fred Ikl� and Mike Pillsbury, who had long been urging it. Senator
                    Hatch was the most influential proponent on the Hill for supplying Stingers.
                    Congressman Wilson was also a strong supporter, but on this issue played a
                    lesser role than he had earlier on other issues dealing with Afghanistan,
                    particularly raising the level of assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>The issue of providing Stingers became a bureaucratic battle with State/NEA and
                    CIA opposing the transfer of the weapon system. Bill Casey didn't seem
                    particularly involved, but I always thought he objected because his staff was
                    opposed to the transfer, but I was never sure why Casey's position left me
                    particularly puzzled since he would support any action against the Soviets. The
                    U.S. military was opposed because it did not want to release any Stingers from
                    its inventory. Armacost and I supported the transfer as did some parts of Ikl�
                    and Pillsbury.</p>
                <p>We had meeting after meeting trying to resolve our differences. This went on for
                    months during which more parts of State came to our point of view. Then someone
                    threw in another monkey wrench: the story was that President Zia was opposed to
                    the transfer of Stingers to the mujahideen. Pillsbury convinced Hatch that it
                    would be very helpful if the senator would take a trip to the area to make his
                    own assessment. I went on that trip. During his visit to Pakistan, Hatch of
                    course had a meeting with Zia during which he raised the rumor that the
                    Pakistani president was opposed to the transfer of Stingers. Zia refuted that
                    quickly and decisively; he said if course his government was in support of such
                    transfer since it would help the insurgents. That was the decisive psychological
                    turn. The opposition had run out of ammunition; the military was over-ruled and
                    finally they supplied Stingers from its inventory.</p>
                <p>There is no question that the transfer had an impact. We used to get reports of
                    the number of helicopters that had been shot down; they were not exactly
                    reliable, but there was no question that the Soviets faced a radical change to
                    the situation on the battlefield. Not only Stingers, but far more assistance was
                    being given to the resistance. I can't say that the Stingers were the
                    determinant factor in the Soviet decision to leave Afghanistan; I don't know,
                    but there was no doubt that it was a factor in Soviet calculation of the costs
                    of their venture. I won't go as far as the recent book and movie Charlie
                    Wilson's War has gone in its finding that the Stingers were responsible for the
                    Soviet retreat, but I think there is no question that they contributed to Soviet
                    policy development. The reports of their accuracy I found a little
                    incredulous.</p>
                <p>Just a footnote here: when I was the president of the Carnegie Endowment, I saw
                    Shevardnadze when I went to Moscow to begin creating the Endowment's Moscow
                    center. I went with Strobe Talbott and Dimitri Simes. I said to Shevardnadze
                    that I just had to ask him how important the supplying of Stingers was to the
                    Soviet withdrawal decision. He got visible angry and said in no uncertain terms
                    that the Stinger had nothing to do with the decision to withdraw. He would not
                    acknowledge in any way that the Stingers played any role. The Soviets, they
                    withdraw for their own reasons. Despite Shevardnadze disclaimer, I still believe
                    they contributed to the Soviet decision to withdraw. There is no question that
                    the provision of the anti-aircraft missiles gave the insurgents renewed vigor
                    and passion and greater world-wide publicity. At the time, no one had ever heard
                    of Osama Bin Laden, although we were very aware of the questionable attitude and
                    nature of the mujahideen. Unfortunately, the Pakistani really controlled arms
                    supplies to the various insurgent groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The trip to Pakistan took place in January, 1986. On the way back, I got off in
                    the Philippines. I stayed just a few days, but had an opportunity just to talk
                    to a wide variety of peoplpoliticians and non-politicians. The presidential
                    elections were in full swing. I went to some of the rallies which were as
                    enthusiastic as I have seen in a political setting. There was excitement in the
                    air; people sensed that Marcos was coming to an end and that Aquino would win.
                    Aquino was a very nice woman; not particularly impressive but very congenial,
                    very dedicated, and very honest. At the first Secretary's staff meeting after my
                    trip, Shultz asked me for my view of the Philippine situation. I told him that I
                    was very surprised by the vigor and enthusiasm I had observed in the Philippines
                    in the campaign. I thought Cory's meetings were more of a revival meeting than a
                    political rally. It was an extraordinary movement in which people at all levels
                    of society were participating.</p>
                <p>A little while after the staff meeting, the Secretary called me and asked me to
                    come to his office. He told me that he wanted to apologize for having criticized
                    me at a meeting that was held right after the staff meeting. He thought that my
                    analytical intelligence judgment had been colored by my seeming effort to become
                    involved in a policy debate. He repeated what he had told me before:
                    intelligence analysis and policy making were two distinct processes that should
                    never be mixed. After thinking about my views, the Secretary had come to the
                    conclusion that he had been wrong about discussing me before the others and
                    therefore wanted to express his regret. He said that I should have been present
                    when he spoke those negative comments about me. I told him that I appreciated
                    his commentI was impresseparticularly since the Secretary was the first to tell
                    me about that meeting; no one else had said anything to me. He did re-emphasize
                    his view that my role as director of INR barred me from becoming involved in
                    policy development; the separation of intelligence and policy was an important
                    management goal which he intended to pursue.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>I said that I understood his concern and was taking steps to insure that the
                    separation of the two functions was being maintained. But I also told the
                    Secretary that the goal depended essentially on the self-imposed discipline of
                    an intelligence analyst; there were no rules that could be developed that would
                    absolutely insure the separatiowhether he was a State employee or CIA or a
                    member of any of the intelligence agencies around town. Education was essential
                    but not sufficient. Furthermore, I told him that in my view it was essential for
                    any good analyst to understand the policy making process if his or her work were
                    to be of use. That knowledge would enhance the utility, as well as dispassion of
                    the work. I felt therefore that it was important for analysts to be involved in
                    meetings so that at least they could get a feel for perspectives on the relevant
                    issues and could contribute their knowledge and insights to the policy making
                    process. In the end the result depended on the honesty of the analyst and
                    his/her dedication to the truth as he/she saw it. The management goal of
                    separating analysis from policy making as well as the role of intelligence
                    agencies in policy making, including INR and perhaps particularly me, was
                    something of a caricature, but there would be a continuing tension during my
                    period as director of INR as to whether we were abiding by it. I suspect that it
                    has been a periodic source of bureaucratic disputes before and after my time in
                    INR. I did not remind Shultz of my role in the Stinger.</p>
                <p>In addition to the difficulty of total separation of the analytical process from
                    policy making, the achievement of the goal was made harder by my role as the
                    State representative of the covert action committee. The convergence of policy
                    making and intelligence analysis is almost impossible to stop when you are faced
                    with the question of providing Stingers to the mujahideen in Afghanistan or when
                    one of our planes was hijacked in Cairo. I suggested in a meeting with the
                    Secretary that it should be brought down. That was certainly a policy making
                    decision. No one expressed any objections to my participation in those policy
                    development sessions, although I was only supposed to provide “the facts.” That
                    story appears in Shultz' book, in a somewhat different way. Although I don't
                    have any basic issue with Shultz' management objective, it is not as easy to
                    carry out as he might have thought. If it were it would have diminished the
                    utility of intelligence analysis. In any event analysts read about policy daily
                    n the papers.</p>
                <p>INR, in my prejudiced thinking, did a superb job in the 1985-89 period. INR had
                    plenty of opportunities to produce very important analyses. We were right on our
                    analysis and predictions on the Philippines, for example. Nevertheless, the
                    tensions over intelligence analysis that I described earlier existed; it was in
                    part at least fueled by Bill Casey who distrusted his own agency's work. His
                    view of the agency skewing of its Soviet analysis had an effect on Shultz as
                    well. I think that despite the Secretary's somewhat optimistic view of the
                    possibility of walling off entirely intelligence from policy, his concern for
                    the problem was very commendable. As I said, I had no problem with the
                    Secretary's goal, but in the end the effectiveness of achieving the objective
                    depended primarily on the discipline of the analyst or his or her boss; it would
                    not come about by shutting people out of discussion of policy issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me move on to events in the Balkans in the 1985-89
                        period. Do you remember what role you might have played as the U.S. faced
                        the break-up of Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I didn't play any real role, the most was when the Secretary asked me
                    in 1987 for an analysis of what might happen in Yugoslavia, particularly after
                    the huge demonstration in Belgrade and other cities in 1987. I was asked to go
                    there to look at the situation. I did that along with my chief analyst for the
                    region. We spent a week in Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. We submitted a brief
                    report, the first draft of which was written by the analyst. We basically
                    concluded that there was a race between the forces of nationalism and economic
                    integration. We were not sure which would come out on top. My analyst felt that
                    nationalism would win out; he was right. I was not that certain about that
                    conclusion and equivocated to some degree. But we did conclude that the future
                    looked quite grim and a break up of Yugoslavia was quite likely. My analyst was
                    certain of the break up; I was not so certain and we left some wiggle room in
                    our report.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of traveling as assistant secretary. I don't know if my travel
                    schedule was heavier than those of my predecessors, but my role in the covert
                    action process added to the normal schedule that an assistant secretary might
                    have. I got involved in Panama because of that role; I got involved in Pakistan
                    because of that role; I got involved in El Salvador and Nicaragua because of
                    that role. I thought it was essential that I see with my own eyes what the local
                    situation was which allowed me to give my bosses some informed recommendations.
                    I visited East Asia and spent a week or so in Russia looking at Gorbachev
                    phenomenon. I attended meetings abroad with some of my foreign counterparts; I
                    met several times with my British counterparts and intelligence people. I built
                    up a close relationship with the German intelligence network. We had an annual
                    exchange with Israel. It was a collegiate atmosphere with CIA and INR meeting
                    both overseas and in Washington with the leadership of the foreign intelligence
                    networks. I was on the road for considerable periods.</p>

                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: As I said, I had excellent deputies which enabled me to delegate a
                    lot of the responsibilities (Dick Clark, Mark Blumenthal, Frank McNeil, Jay
                    Taylor). They could do whatever they saw necessary but they obviously had to
                    keep me informed. They also knew my concerns. They all had strong personalities
                    and were by and large quite aggressive in the pursuit of excellent output. I
                    viewed my job as monitoring them, tasking them, assuring myself that the right
                    issues were being analyzed, etc. I personally tried to focus on those issues to
                    which I thought INR could make a real contribution and were of concern to
                    Seventh Floor principals. I also chose issues which were “down INR's alley”;
                    i.e., we had analysts that had over many years developed deep and thorough
                    knowledge of difficult issues or issues which were so data-inadequate that we in
                    INR could be useful even with limited information. In fact, the issues I chose
                    were at the ends of a spectrueither we knew a lot about them or we knew
                    something which could add to situations which were basically a mystery to the
                    Department in general. Examples of the issues on which I concentrated were
                    Afghanistan, which I described earlier; and terrorism, which was beginning to be
                    recognized as a real challenge to the U.S. Shultz was an early real bear on the
                    subject. I spent a lot of my personal time on the Philippines not only because
                    of my personal interest in that country, but also because we had a very good
                    analyst in INR who was widely respected for her knowledge. China got a
                    considerable amount of my personal time, because it had engaged my attention for
                    many years and we here too had a very good group of analysts. And finally, I
                    spent a lot of time following all covert actions, because I was the primary
                    staff person for the State representative on the “covert action” committee. This
                    took a lot of my time because in the Reagan years, there was lots of covert
                    action.</p>
                <p>Since we were the first bureau in the Department to see intelligence reports from
                    other agencies, we were able, as I described earlier, to quickly alert a Seventh
                    Floor principal to the significance of an event or developing situation. I had
                    some very good terrorist analysts which allowed us to make valuable
                    contributions.</p>
                <p>In general, we had an open field to focus on whatever issues we wanted. As I said
                    before, we were also tasked by Armacost on an almost daily basis to do some work
                    on specific issues that he was interested in. This would more often involve not
                    only an analysis, but also attendance in meetings on the subject during which we
                    were asked to present our perspective. Our view was not always consistent with
                    that of other bureaus, which periodically created some tensions. This was
                    particularly true for EA then headed by Paul Wolfowitz like on selling Taiwan
                    weapons; there were times when their insights were better than ours. I do not
                    want to leave the impression that INR was always right in its analysis;
                    sometimes we were certainly not. One specific instance in which our forecast was
                    erroneous was on the periodic sale of weapons to Taiwan; in some cases we
                    expected a stronger response from China which never came as the regional bureau
                    had predicted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other issues do you remember getting involved
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I made it a practice to pursue issues which had important new
                    wrinkles to them. For example, I became very interested in the Gorbachev
                    accession. I went to the Soviet Union about six months after his assumption of
                    power. The question was whether this new man brought some new perspectives to
                    the Soviet Union or was he just repackaging old approaches. When I returned, I
                    consulted with my analysts and wrote a number of papers on my views of the
                    situation. I had come to the conclusion that Gorbachev was indeed a new
                    phenomenon, which would bring major changes to the policies and attitudes of the
                    Soviet Union. Ultimately, Shultz through his meetings with Soviet leaders and
                    reflecting the views of much of the Department, came to the same conclusion. He
                    saw that there were major changes going on in the Soviet Union, which gave the
                    U.S. opportunities for establishing a more stable relationship with the Soviet
                    Union. I should note that the CIA was often vigorously opposed to Shultz'
                    conclusions. We had major arguments with the agency on this issue; the agency
                    saw the changes in the Soviet Union as cosmetic and Casey himself was very
                    negative on taking initiatives to try to establish better relationship with the
                    USSR. On one occasion, he voiced his concern to me during a meeting we were
                    having over Shultz' dealings with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze.</p>
                <p>Another issue which I thought required additional attention and I became deeply
                    involved was Panama. It began when the U.S. attorney in Florida sought and got
                    an indictment against Noriega. That forced a change in our whole approach to him
                    and his regime. The issue became “How do we get Noriega out of Panama?” This
                    turned out to be one of the most interesting and depressing episodes that I
                    witnessed during my career in the Foreign Service. In my view, the U.S.
                    government really debased itself and tied itself in bureaucratic knots in the
                    pursuit of this objective.</p>
                <p>I thought it was important for Noriega to be removed from power as rapidly as
                    possiblpeacefully! whether or not this meant that he had to leave Panama. Bill
                    Webster had just taken over the leadership of CIA which was still recovering
                    from the toll that Iran-Contra had inflicted on it. The agency was very skittish
                    at this moment about taking major risks such as trying to mobilize major
                    opposition in Panama against Noriega. It wanted life to settle down. The ARA
                    bureau, led by Elliott Abrams and Mike Kozak, were determined to try to depose
                    Noriega. I certainly supported that effort. I visited Panama several times and
                    talked to opposition leaders and many others to get some feel for the situation.
                    I tried to find those willing to take more robuscovert and publiaction against
                    Noriega. I sent some of my analysts to follow up on my trip to survey the scene
                    in detail.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>The Pentagon, which could have played a major role, was by and large antagonistic
                    toward Abrams. It was virtually impossible to get a coordinated U.S.
                    government-wide program to deal with Noriega. In the end, it was negotiations
                    led by Mike Kozak, with Noriega which became the principal avenue to seek his
                    departure. Of course, as happens periodically, this negotiation effort became
                    involved in the U.S. presidential campaign. The White House wanted no part of
                    negotiating efforts; they didn't want to be seen making any obeisance toward
                    Noriega. Prior to a meeting in Russia Shultz told Kozapresumably reflecting
                    White House anxietiethat he had to get agreement on the negotiations before his
                    trip; otherwise all efforts would have to be suspended. The negotiations just
                    ran out of time and ultimately led to the U.S. using military action to remove
                    Noriega. I must say that this option had never entered into my calculations; I
                    didn't think that that was the way to remove him unless there were much greater
                    provocations. The fighting happened after my departure from INR. The whole U.S.
                    government approach was dysfunctionait lacked cohesion, lacked unity, lacked
                    determination. We looked silly. I told my brother-in-law, the composer Phil
                    Glass, who was always writing operas about major figures, to do a comic
                    operNorieghe did not take my advice.</p>
                <p>My recollection is a little vague on the kind of other issues we brought to the
                    attention of the Seventh Floor. We certainly did a lot of work on all the issues
                    I have discussed. I don't now remember clearly the many other issues we focused
                    on either because they were of interest to a Seventh Floor principal or because
                    we in INR felt they deserved analysis and attention in the building. I really
                    would need to see our output for the period 1985-89 to be sure.</p>
                <p>All in all, my four years in INR were active and interesting. I was able to
                    pursue issues that had been of interest to me for many years. I was involved in
                    some very sensitive policy developments. But I regretted often being mostly a
                    bystander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings us to 1989 when you were appointed as our
                        ambassador to Turkey. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I had been in INR for four years and it was time to move on.
                    Secretary Baker agreed to appoint me to an ambassadorship. There were a number
                    of openings that were discussed with me, but I finally focused on Turkey.</p>
                <p>I wanted the ambassadorship to Korea, but that was well filled. I thought that
                    China was then beyond “my reach.” (I was offered it in the Clinton
                    administration.) So I looked around for an important and interesting post and
                    came up with the idea of Turkey. I didn't know much about Turkey, but I thought
                    it was an important post not getting adequate attention and the ambassador would
                    be very important.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>It is fair to say that James Baker, when he became Secretary of State, wanted to
                    put his own people in the positions occupied by Shultz' appointees. He talked to
                    us; I briefed him on what I thought were the major issues facing the U.S. and
                    the intelligence role. After he was officially sworn in, he called me on the
                    phone and asked me what I wanted to do on my next assignment. I had been giving
                    that question some thought; I would like to have become a regional assistant
                    secretary but I knew they were not available. I did consider retiring, but
                    thought I would give it one more shot. So I told Baker that I would like to be
                    assigned to Turkey. That afternoon to my astonishment Baker called and said he
                    had talked to the President and cleared my name, a total contrast to my
                    experience in the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>I had, during my INR incarnations paid some attention to Turkey and NATO, and
                    Turkey and the Kurds, etc. I had insisted that we blame Iraq publicly for its
                    use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. So I wasn't a total stranger to
                    Turkish issues, but I did not have the background which I had had for Thailand.
                    I certainly had no feel for the people, their culture, or their history. So I
                    spent about two months trying to reduce my gaps of knowledge, including learning
                    some every elemental aspects of the language. I left for Ankara in the summer of
                    1989.</p>
                <p>Turkey attracted me because it was a member of NATO and a player in the Muslim
                    and Central Asian worlds. It was an important U.S. ally with whom we had to
                    maintain good relations. In 1989, I had no idea of what would happen in the
                    Middle East in1990 and 1991.</p>
                <p>In fact, once I got to Ankara, I found it very difficult to gain the attention of
                    the Seventh Floor, not to mention the White House, to Turkish issues. I couldn't
                    even entice an assistant secretary to visit Turkey. The Turks had gained a
                    reputation for always asking for assistance; Washington senior officials did not
                    want to be the target for such requests. The Turks were not viewed too favorably
                    in Washington outside the Pentagon. We did have a number of DoD officials visit,
                    but their visits were driven by our military presence in Turkey, particularly
                    the Air Force. Richard Perle was a strong supporter of funding and was the
                    dominant figure in town until the Iraq war.</p>
                <p>During my second year in Ankara, that situation changed totally. That was due to
                    the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Secretary Baker's frequent visits to Turkey.
                    Baker was all business; he would arrive, talk to the president and a few other
                    Turkish leaders and then leave. He did that on three of the four occasions he
                    visited Ankara. Before his last visit, I went to see the president to tell him
                    that Baker would like to come again to see him. Ozal said that was fine with
                    him, but that Baker had to stay long enough to have dinner with him. So Baker
                    did have dinner with the president and enjoyed it. You never know what problems
                    will confront you as an ambassador! In any case, the second year of my tour was
                    much easier in terms of Washington support.</p>

                        to build an overall framework for the relations between the two countries.
                        Did you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: That point of view is accuratup to a point. That there were always
                    problems is accurate because we had such extensive relations with Turkey. We had
                    military bases on their territory; we had a large military assistance program;
                    there were frequent NATO issues. Then there was the Greek-Turkish animosity
                    continuously fueled in large part by Cyprus. So there were always challenges
                    that required discussion with the prime minister, the president, foreign
                    minister or his staff. Marc Grossman, our DCM, was very helpful in this
                    connection and handled many of these matters very well indeed. My recruitment of
                    Grossman was one my best ideas even though the personnel establishmenand
                    otherwere upset since he was grade-wise too junior for the DCM position; I got
                    the Seventh Floor to agree. As you know, he later became ambassador to Turkey
                    and Under-Secretary for Political Affairs. Going back to your point, the nature
                    of an overall framework for relations was the Cold War and the alliance. The
                    problem of another framework became important after the end of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>Despite daily problems, one distinct difference between Greece and Turkey was the
                    reactions of American officers. I have never met an American Foreign Service
                    person who did not enjoy serving in Turkey. On the other hand, most of those I
                    knew who served in Greece ended up celebrating their last day there. I did not
                    experience Greece. Life was apparently much more difficult in Greece for
                    American officials than it was in Turkey. The Turks are always hospitable and
                    accommodating which allowed us to get past the daily problems and establish good
                    personal relations, even though we come from different cultures. Turks clearly
                    do not now like Americall the polls show thabut I have not experienced that
                    animosity in personal relations. The only departure from that was a calculated
                    show of hostility toward visiting Defense Secretary Cheney over the Greek
                    DECA.</p>
                <p>Turkish officials could be difficult. That often happens in dependent
                    relationships such as we had at that time with Turkey. With the end of the Cold
                    War, the situation began to change and that dependency has mostly evaporated.
                    Turkey increasingly marches to its own drummer. During the Cold War, our
                    presence in Turkey was a major security concern for the Turks; we provided a
                    shield for its defense and huge amounts of defense assistance. The principal
                    goal of Turkish foreign policy was to maintain our strong military alliance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a number of situations in the world where we were
                        looked upon as “lord protector” or “big brother”. How did you feel about

                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Thailand was far more that type of situation, where I was often
                    viewewrongly regrettablas being able to move mountains. That was much less true
                    in Turkey. In any case, my personality does really not fit the role of
                    “viceroy.” I don't wave the flag, make all sorts of public appearances, and give
                    orders. That is not my style. I am not entirely comfortable as being
                    occasionally viewed as a savior; when that happens, I find it quite troublesome
                    and certainly overstated.</p>
                <p>I sometimes got annoyed with the Turks, in part because they would question our
                    assurances or because they would raise problems of such minor nature that they
                    weren't really worthy of discussion at senior levels. They could be very
                    bureaucratic, particularly during negotiations. But by and large, I very much
                    enjoyed my tour in Ankara and met a lot of Turks whom I became very fond of. I
                    found and still find Turkey endlessly fascinating; so much so that I have
                    maintained a continuing relationship to a far greater extent than any of the
                    other countries in which I served. I still keep up with the Turkish English
                    press. Back to the point, the role of the American embassy is important but it
                    has declined because Turkey has become a different country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation at the end of the 1980 decade with
                        Turkey's participation in the EU?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The issue was just beginning to bubble up. Historically, the Turks
                    made a serious mistake by letting the Greeks precede them in getting EU
                    membership. The Turks should have insisted on simultaneous admission; they had
                    the opportunity to do so, but let it pass. Ozal made the decision to join the EU
                    in 1987, but there really wasn't any progress made while I was in Turkey. During
                    the Gulf War I tried to move the progress along by getting the USG to issue the
                    first statement during the Gulf War supporting Turkey's efforts to get into the
                    EU, not only because I thought it was the right policy, but also to show the
                    Turks that we were interested in helping them achieve their goals. By 1995, long
                    after I was gone, finally a customs union was agreed to which was followed later
                    by the EU accepting Turkey as a candidate for membership. Turkey still has a
                    long way to go.</p>
                <p>The two major issues during my tour were the Armenian “genocide” and the Gulf
                    War. There were, as I mentioned, a number of other issues, many of which were
                    operational in nature.g., use of bases. There were some questions concerning
                    Bulgaria-Turkey relations, some economic issues, the Soviet threat, which was
                    often a NATO issue than just a bilateral problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you surprised by anything you encountered after your
                        arrival in Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: Right from the start unexpected things happened: a) Turkey suddenly
                    had a huge refugee problefleeing Bulgarian-Turks. I saw this as an opportunity
                    for the U.S. to be helpful both to refugees and to the host country. It was a
                    humanitarian issue with which I had had some familiarity from my Thailand tour.
                    I was aware of tensions between Bulgarians and this Turkish population, but
                    neither I nor the Turks had any expectation that some 300,000 people would flee
                    to Turkey. Once I grasped the magnitude and its causes the embassy went to work
                    in publicizing the issue and particularly in finding assistance for the Turkish
                    Bulgarians.</p>
                <p>Friction between the Turks and the Bulgarians was of course not new. It centered
                    on discrimination against the Turkish minority living in Bulgaria, most recently
                    for me on their surnames. But the embassy and Washington were surprised by the
                    rather sudden and very large flight from Bulgaria. I spent some time with
                    President Ozal on this problem which helped me in establishing a good
                    relationship with him. I think that my immediate reaction and our offer of
                    assistance was a positive introduction to the president and the foreign office
                    and to Turkey in general.</p>
                <p>The American embassy has always been an important institution in Turkey. The
                    American ambassador was an important figure covered thoroughly by the Turkish
                    press. American presidents rarely spoke to the Turkish presidenit was a
                    different relationship than he had with leaders of other NATO countries. During
                    my tour, no Assistant Secretary for EUR visited Turkey. It is somewhat stunning
                    to remember how we left so much distance from Turkey prior to 1990, even though
                    we used its territory for bases and saw Turkey as an integral part of NATO.
                    Assistant Secretaries disliked meeting with Turks because they always seemed to
                    be asking for something. They were tired of Turkish complaints and “demands.”
                    None visited on their own when I was there. George Shultz did make an effort to
                    maintain good relations with the Turks; he liked and respected his
                    counterpart.</p>
                <p>In the late 1980's I would describe our relationships with Turkey despite its ups
                    and downs as “okay.” I think it is fair to say at that time that the major
                    player in Washington in determining our policy toward Turkey seemed to be
                    Richard Perle, then Assistant Secretary for ISA in DoD. He was viewed both in
                    Washington and in Ankara sort of as “Mr. Turkey.”</p>
                <p>The Turks used to complain long and hard about what is known as the 7-10 ratio,
                    which governed the allocation of U.S. assistance between Turkey and Greece. They
                    were unhappy with what they saw as their military requirements were tied to
                    Greece and they also perceived a bias in favor of Greece on the Cyprus issue.
                    Days when we didn't have some tensions about one issue or another were few.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>The major source of tension during my first year was the Armenian genocide
                    resolution. I became deeply involved in this problem in 1990. It was a long
                    difficult issue; loaded with enormous emotions on both sides. I didn't think
                    that the Turks have really yet come to grips with their past. While I had some
                    sympathy for the resolution, I was opposed to it being introduced in the Senate.
                    The Senate was not a proper forum for making decisions about Turkish history,
                    one which was strongly disputed by the Turkish government. But even more
                    importantly for American interests, I also had strategic concerns. By early
                    1990, it was clear to me that we would likely be going to war against Iraq. We
                    would need Turkish assistance and support to mount an attack to drive the Iraqis
                    out of Kuwait. We did not want to imperil that.</p>
                <p>I returned to Washington and spent two or three weeks primarily going from
                    senator to senator, lobbying against the resolution. I must have seen some 60
                    senators. I did this because the Bush administration was reluctant to becoming
                    publicly involved in the debate; they did not want their fingerprints on any
                    debate about the resolution for domestic political reasons. While opposed to the
                    resolution, the administration was reluctant to be seen taking any highly public
                    actions which might alienate the Armenian-American community. That left the
                    lobbying burden mostly to me.</p>
                <p>Senator Robert Byrd played the key role. He mobilized Senate opposition to the
                    resolution. There was a remarkabland poorly coveredebate that lasted for two
                    days on the genocide resolution. Two of the Senate's leading figures opposed
                    each other on the floor for several hours daily. Bob Dole supported the
                    resolution; Bob Byrd opposed it. The two days were filled with eloquence, which
                    received very little media attention. I thought it was a remarkable event. You
                    don't often see two Titans of the Senate debating an important issue on the
                    floor in a great personal contest. The final vote was very close with Byrd's
                    side winning by a narrow margin.</p>
                <p>I had talked to President Ozal at length about the resolution. He was annoyed
                    with it all. It got in his way to do other things with the U.S. He did not like
                    the resolution but simply wanted it out of the way. But he could not publicly
                    take the position of pass the damn thing and let's move on, as he once said to
                    me, his bureaucracy and public vehemently denied any Turkish participation in a
                    genocide. Nevertheless, the conclusion of Senate debate took the issue off the
                    agenda; it came up annually but not in a major way until late in this
                    decade.</p>
                <p>We avoided a major confrontation with Turkey in 1990 when the resolution was not
                    passed. The history is a very sensitive issue and all U.S. governments
                    understand that. The Turks resent having their ancestors branded as committing
                    genocide. Perhaps even more important, the Turks believe that if a resolution on
                    genocide is approved, it will be followed by an avalanche of demands from the
                    Armenians for restitutions and reparations. The Armenians deny that they would
                    pursue such a course, but that does not assuage the Turkish concern.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>The Armenians are determined to have a genocide resolution passed by the
                    Congress. They have pursued it for more then thirty years. Such a resolution was
                    passed in the French parliament and some other legislatures. But the U.S.
                    Congress is really their target. There are a million or so Armenian-Americans,
                    concentrated in California key state in any primary or general election.
                    Pressure will always be mounted again when a new administration comes to power
                    in Washington. The Armenian-Americans had great hopes for passage in the
                    Congress in 2008; after all, one of their key representatives is now Speaker
                    Pelosi. She was supported by George Miller, also from California; in fact they
                    did come very close with 218 representatives prepared to vote in favor of the
                    resolution. But at the last minute, Pelosi barred the resolution from coming to
                    the floor of the House. The Turks made their position very clear including
                    threats of retaliatory actions and there was great concern that they would deny
                    the U.S. the use of Turkish basis for Iraq. This motivated the administration to
                    put on a full court press which finally forced Pelosi to avoid a vote. There is
                    no question in my mind that the passage of such a resolution will be costly to
                    us. I have told Turks that they have lost the battle of history; that concerned
                    Americans, regardless of Turkish views of the confused wartime situation, most
                    concerned Americans believe that genocide did take place; that point of view
                    will not likely change. Only a clear exposition of the potential costs to
                    national security can prevent ultimate passage of such a resolution.</p>
                <p>When Saddam invaded Kuwait in August, President Ozal supported us immediately,
                    but not the bulk of Turks. They were opposed and did not want to get involved. I
                    cannot say that his support would not have been given regardless of the outcome
                    of the Senate action on the genocide resolution. But Ozal hated Saddam Hussein,
                    and resented the Iraqis controlling oil prices; their hold on prices would have
                    increased substantially had they been able to keep Kuwait and control that
                    country's oil production. Turkey had taken a major economic blow in the late
                    1970's when the Middle East oil producers reduced their output; indeed, it went
                    into a deep recession. Ozal was very sensitive to Iraqi behavior. He fully
                    supported all that Turkey could do to help us, that was important to our war
                    effort. But we dodged a bullet by the defeat of the genocide resolution.</p>
                <p>Dealings with top leaders was very important. James Baker, much to his credit,
                    did something that Colin Powell as Secretary had never done in the run up to the
                    Iraq war in 2003. Powell never visited Turkey. Baker came four times in eight
                    months. That was very important. The presence of Ozal made the biggest
                    difference; he was very much pro-American, hated Saddam Husseihe was on the same
                    wave length with us.</p>

                        Complexities of American Policymaking on Turkey”. First of all, I want to
                        focus on Cyprus. Did it play a major role during your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: There were two major episodes during my period about Cyprus. One was
                    Baker's difficult encounter with Cyprus. We of course during my time kept
                    pushing for a resolution of the Cyprus issue. Ozal was indeed interested in
                    reaching such a resolution. I had a meeting with the Greek prime minister in
                    Ankara during which I was grilled about Turkish intentions in reaching a
                    settlement. I told him that there were a wide range of views in Ankara with the
                    military and some politicians taking a very hard line while Ozal was very
                    interested in reaching a compromise. During the Iraq war, James Baker came to
                    believe that he could bring the parties together to reach a settlement. I though
                    he was over-optimistic; and minimized the political difficulties a compromise
                    faced at least in Turkey. Furthermore, his timing, I thought, was very poor; our
                    war with Iraq was not popular in Turkey, despite Ozal's support, and any efforts
                    the U.S. might make on Cyprus would be viewed with deep skepticism by the Turks.
                    I told the Secretary that he should not push for a settlement and I personally
                    did little to pursue the issue with the Turks.</p>
                <p>Most of my communications on Cyprus were with the EUR country director; from time
                    to time I raised the issue with the office director at State, Towny Friedman.
                    Towny was a very smart and sensible person. He was also sometimes too secretive.
                    He basically agreed with my skepticism on the Cyprus issue. Baker became quite
                    upset with me, blaming me for building an antagonistic atmosphere for a solution
                    of the Cyprus issue. I thought that was not a fair charge; I always told the
                    Secretary that his timing was wrong, but I did not vent my skepticism with Ozal
                    and other Turkish officials. The Secretary's efforts were in vain. No progress
                    was made on a resolution of the Cyprus dispute. A decade had to pass before
                    there was progress. But that failed largely because of the Greek Cypriots</p>
                <p>After the end of the Iraq war, President Bush visited Turkey. He was warmly
                    greeted, despite popular distaste for the war, not as vociferous as in the 2003
                    war. Bush was very gracious. After all, he had won the war. Cyprus was on the
                    list of issues to be discussed by the two presidents. To the best of my
                    recollection, Bush suggested that he convene a trilateral meetinTurkey, Greece
                    and Cypruto see whether the leaders of those countries could not reach some
                    broad agreement. Unfortunately Turkey had just gotten a new prime minister who
                    broke with Ozaunlike his predecessor who marched to Ozal's tune all the time.
                    The new prime minister was not interested in such a conference because he was
                    concerned that he would be up-staged by Ozal. He wanted to be seen as his own
                    master and one who was in charge in Ankara, not Ozal. So the Bush proposaan
                    interesting onwent nowhere and the U.S. held the Turkish prime minister
                    responsible for its demise.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>In late June, 1990, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney visited Ankara. Tensions on
                    the Kuwait-Iraq border were already rising. Shortly before the SecDef's arrival,
                    the U.S. and Greece announced that they had concluded a defense agreement. I
                    knew nothing about it; I didn't even know that negotiations were taking place.
                    As you can well understand, I was not a happy camper; I was mad as hell. I
                    learned subsequently that I had been intentionally left out of the loop by our
                    country director because he was concerned that we might object to some of
                    provision or other and might try to sabotage his efforts to reach an agreement.
                    In fact, it was not a bad agreement and I think his concerns were unwarranted.
                    It did include some rhetorical language which could have been misinterpreted.
                    That might have been changed. The Turks, however, became incensed by some of the
                    language in the agreement. So when Cheney arrived, he became a target for the
                    Turks who surprisingly ranted to him.</p>
                <p>The normally very hospitable Turks treated Cheney almost as if he were a leper.
                    Very few senior people came to the reception the embassy gave for him. I had a
                    conversation with him about the whole business and told him that what he had
                    gone through was “a tempest in a tea-pot”. The agreement posed no threat to
                    Turkey. I asked him to go back to talk to the President and try to convince him
                    to call Ozal to calm things down and dispel any misconceptions that we had just
                    signed on to an anti-Turkish agreement. Cheney did that. Bush made that call and
                    asked Ozal whether he wanted the White House to issue a statement clarifying the
                    agreement and assuring the world that it was not in any way harmful to Turkey.
                    Ozal liked that idea and Bush did make the statement. That calmed the waters in
                    Turkey. Perhaps even more important, this episode established a very close
                    relationship between Bush and Ozal which paid major dividends to us during the
                    Gulf War. I believe that Bush probably consulted with Ozal by phone more often
                    than with any other leader except John Major before the war and during the war
                    period. There were fifty or sixty calls in that 12 month period. Fortunately,
                    Nick Burns at the NSC would brief me after each call, which allowed me to make
                    suggestions for the next call. This president to president exchange became a
                    very valuable tool. So an episode which had such a disastrous beginning ended up
                    in a very positive manner. The law of unintended consequences at work again.</p>
                <p>The Turks used the Cheney visit as a means to express their anger and
                    frustration. Not only were the Turks concerned by some of the wording in the
                    Greek-U.S. agreement, but they also resented not having been informed beforehand
                    on a matter they considered to be of vital interest. They might have valid
                    reasons for their displeasure at the Secretary, but I think they also vastly
                    inflated the matter.</p>

                        the Middle East plays a major role in our relationships with Turkey. Did
                        they cause you any special challenges?</hi>

                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: There were always problems with the bases. They were mostly small
                    problems: e.g., the need to remove certain individuals from Turkey for
                    transgressions, the use of bases for special activities, etc. They arose
                    continually and took a lot of our time to resolve.</p>
                <p>The major issue arose with the Gulf War and the use of Turkish bases to fight
                    that war. I mentioned that President Ozal hated Saddam and viewed him as a real
                    threat to Turkey's stability. So we had an ally in spirit even before we sought
                    Turkish assistance. At our request, Ozal moved very quickly to shut down the
                    pipeline that carried oil from Iraq to the Mediterranean, even though it was an
                    income earner for the Turks.</p>
                <p>Our requests to Turkey included: 1) using their bases for military strikes, 2)
                    moving Turkish troops to the Iraq border as a potential threat to Iraq thereby
                    forcing Saddam to keep Iraq troops on this border rather than moving them south
                    to fight us, and 3) sending some troops to Saudi Arabia to be part of the
                    anti-Saddam coalition. At this time the Turkish military were not on good terms
                    with Ozal because they were unhappy with how he managed national security
                    concerns, which to them was in a free-wheeling manner. By and large, they did
                    not support that war against Iraq.</p>
                <p>In any case, Ozal approved our requests for the use of the bases although he
                    delayed all decisions until we actually initiated military actions against the
                    Iraqis. He was not interested in our expanded use of the bases unless actual
                    hostilities broke out; he did not want to have made an unnecessary decision
                    which would have left him politically exposed. Ozal had the implementing
                    legislation immediately approved after we had started bombing; it was done in
                    one day. He called me that day and asked: “Are you satisfied now?”</p>
                <p>We had no problem getting the Turks to send troops to the border. On the other
                    hand, the Turkish military refused to send any forces to Saudi Arabia. I don't
                    think I ever fully understood their rationale other than they did not want a
                    direct participation. Ozal was not in a position to really push his military
                    since he already had a somewhat tense relationship with them and didn't want to
                    take on another fight. The Turkish chief of staff at around this time did
                    something which was quite unusual. Instead of leading a couas well might have
                    happened in earlier timehe resigned in protest against Ozal's policies and
                    management although he did not publicly put it that way.</p>
                <p>We of course were primarily interested in the expanded use of the bases, and were
                    able to use them as needed throughout the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Let me go for a minute to one aspect of the Kurdish problem in Turkey. Turkey had
                    had a long tumultuous relationship with its Kurds. Many Turkish citizens living
                    close to the Iraq border are Kurds. Ankara hadn'and still hasn'found a way to
                    maintain a peaceful and fruitful relationship with the south-east part of its
                    country. The Turkish military dominated the area and ruled it as if martial law
                    had been declared. In 1988, the Turks, after Saddam's use of chemical weapons
                    against the Iraqi Kurds, accepted about 60,000 refugees. They did that in part
                    at American urging. This humanitarian gesture caused a lot of commotion in
                    Turkey, who did not want refugees, and, as long as Saddam ruled Iraq, there was
                    little chance for those refugees to return home. It also raised tensions between
                    us and the Turkish government. In the final analysis, the Turks allowed the
                    refugees to enter Turkey and let them stay.</p>
                <p>Another major Turkish concern had was the PKK, the insurgent Kurd forces
                    operating in bases in northern Iraq. They were not nearly the threat from Iraq
                    that they became later, but it was an irritant to the Turkish military. Turkey
                    had an understanding with Iraq which allowed its forces to move across the
                    border if necessary in pursuit of PKK insurgents.</p>
                <p>The major development in this history occurred during the Gulf War and has shaped
                    events since its occurrence. We had called on the Kurds and the Shiites to raise
                    up against Saddam. There was some response, particularly from the Kurds. Saddam
                    came down hard on Kurdish insurgency causing a very large flow of Kurds to the
                    Turkish border, reaching eventually about half a million refugees. Another
                    million Kurdish refugees fled to the Iranian border. Much of this outflow
                    occurred after the end of the war. Ozal felt it was politically impossible to
                    allow these Iraqi Kurdish refugees to enter. The Kurds on the Turkish border was
                    a major political headache for Ozal.</p>
                <p>It was of course a major humanitarian problem. Regardless of where they were, it
                    was obvious that these refugees needed continuous assistance. Furthermore, the
                    Kurds could not stay in their mountain shelters too much longer because summer
                    was coming and potentially serious health problems because of a lack of water.
                    It was a depressing situation. We pressured the Turks as much as we could to
                    provide assistance to these Kurdish refugees. They provided some, but it was
                    insufficient. I kept insisting to Washington that we take more aggressive action
                    to help the refugees. Washington wanted to send John Bolton who was then the
                    Assistant Secretary for International Organizations. I said we needed higher
                    than that. Suddenly Secretary Baker came; he helicoptered to a site which had
                    Kurds strung along one mountainside. He made some comments, but more
                    importantly, even in that brief period, he saw the desperate nature of the
                    situation. It was a decisive moment. He convinced the President to get the
                    Pentagon involved and the military joined immediately the assistance effort. It
                    was costly, but it made a major difference. It was a turning point in dealing
                    with the Kurdish refugee situation in northern Iraq. Even the Turks, who in
                    general were not happy with the situation welcomed the assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Such assistance was only a short term fix. The fundamental problem of a permanent
                    home for the Iraqi Kurds was unresolved. After many discussions among Bush, Ozal
                    and John Major and sometimes with my involvement with Ozal, it was decided that
                    the Kurdish refugees would be settled in the area many lived in northern Iraq
                    and protected from Saddam. This required some U.S. forces on the ground at least
                    initially to accompany them home, but for the longer term the Kurds would be
                    protected by an allied air monitoring program from Turkish bases. We had to
                    persuade the Kurds to agree to this arrangement; they obviously wanted
                    assurances that they would be sufficiently protected and eventually they agreed
                    to move to the protected area.</p>
                <p>It took about six weeks to move the half-million Kurds to their new grounds. The
                    Kurds who had fled to Iran witnessed this migration and came to the conclusion
                    that they should join their fellow Kurds in Iraq. Another million Kurds moved
                    back to northern Iraq. The “protected” zone was created from which Saddam and
                    his minions were excludeany violation would have had severe military
                    consequences. Ozal was pleased and relieved with this resolution. On the other
                    hand, many Turks were very unhappy because they believed that the creation of
                    this “protected” zone would become the embryo for an independent Iraqi Kurdish
                    state. Such a creation, they felt, would have had a major impact on Turkey's own
                    Kurds. This new scheme had to be approved by the Turkish legislaturevery six
                    months. The first legislative approval was very difficult to obtain, but Ozal
                    managed to squeeze out the necessary votes. Thereafter, for an extended period,
                    this legislative approval became the primary focus of U.S. policy toward
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>The law of “unintended consequences” again followed. I assured all concerned that
                    we could be fully trusted and that we would faithfully maintain watch over the
                    territories occupied by the Kurds and it took assurances from many parts of the
                    U.S. government to have the Kurds and others believe us. The Turks, as I
                    indicated before, were not that enthusiastic about our program. We took special
                    pains to try to reassure them that no independent Kurdish state was contemplated
                    and that after Saddam's eventual downfall, there would be no more serious
                    concerns about an independent Kurdish state. In fact, our assessments turned out
                    wrong because of another totally unexpected Iraq war. Iraq did disintegrate
                    after our invasion in 2003 which led to the creation of almost a de facto
                    Kurdish state. This semi-independent area in northern Iraq also become a problem
                    for the Turks, most immediately because it was the principal base for periodic
                    Kurdish incursions into Turkey. The U.S. has wrestled with the problem since our
                    invasion. To this day, the issues arising from our invasion as they concern the
                    Kurds are a very, very sensitive matter for the Turks. The U.S. ___ to build and
                    maintain a stable Iraqi nation, friendly with the Turks and providing no home
                    for the PKK. Over the past year Turkey's position on Iraqi Kurdistan has evolved
                    and a more fruitful relationship has been established between Turkey and the
                    Iraqi Kurds.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>There is of course considerable uncertainty about the future of an Iraq
                    natiowhether it will survive as a state and what the relationships between the
                    central government and the various regional entities. So our creation of the
                    “safe area” in the 1990-91 period has had unforeseen consequences that deeply
                    involve us today. We were not interested in the establishment of an independent
                    Kurdish nation. I certainly did not in 1991 foresee today's situationor do I
                    know of anyone who did, except the Turks whose “nightmare” scenario actually
                    became reality.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I really didn't see any alternative in 1991 to what we did. It
                    was a humanitarian necessity that we help a million and a half people survive
                    and give them protection so they could decently survive. I also thought that it
                    was the right approach even from a Turkish political point of view. We wish our
                    crystal ball had been clearer.</p>
                <p>It is true that in 1991 the Turks were not unanimous in their concern over an
                    independent Kurdish state and its potential impact on Turkey's own Kurds. The
                    military, saw the developments in Iraq as very dangerous. Ozal had a somewhat
                    different view. He didn't worry too much about a Kurdish state; he thought that
                    in such a case, the Turks might act as an “older brother” and establish a
                    positive connection. His formulation was quite vague; he was primarily
                    interested in getting the Kurdish problem off the Turkish political agenda by
                    getting the Kurds away from the border.</p>
                <p>The second year of my tenure focused on winning the Gulf war and protecting the
                    Iraqi Kurds. In that second year, we also had difficulties with our presence in
                    Turkey. We had one American killed. Many families were scared and wanted to
                    leave. I was constricted in my travels and received a lot of death threats.
                    There were a number of incidents involving Americans. Americans were worried
                    about their safety and sought assurances. Marc Grossman and I spent a lot of
                    time trying to calm those fears. There were some in the official American
                    community that wished for a draw-down of the American presence in Turkey. I did
                    not agree much to the unhappiness of some of our staff. I never thought that the
                    situation had deteriorated to a level requiring any mandated reduction in our
                    official presence.</p>
                <p>The anti-Americanism exhibited by some Turks was not organized. Some of the
                    feeling stemmed from a religious fervor fostered by Islamic fundamentalists;
                    some of it was just an opposition to our policies. Popular opposition during the
                    Second Gulf War was far, far worse. As far as I can remember, there were a
                    number of disparate groups making anti-American waves, but no single entity or
                    even a coalition was driving these sentiments. Unlike 2003 the President of
                    Turkey strongly supported us. I don't remember the PKK being involved. The death
                    of the one American weighed heavily on the whole American community in Turkey.
                    Interestingly enough, I received a nice note from Brent Scowcroft well after
                    that incident thanking me for providing support for the American community and
                    for not succumbing to the pressure for evacuation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On several occasions, you have referred to the Turkish
                        military-civilian relationship. How would you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: The Turkish military is and remains a respected institution in
                    Turkey, stemming from the successful liberation efforts led by General Kemal
                    Ataturk in the early 1920's. He was of course the “father of his country” and
                    the military sees itself as the keeper of Ataturk's political philosophy. The
                    Turkish military is an autonomous institution, not under civilian control. This
                    has been true from the beginning and is still, by and large, true today,
                    although its power has diminished somewhat and its reputation has been a little
                    tarnished. When I was in Turkey, the military was run by a general who did his
                    best to stay out of politics, while trying to calm whatever restive feelings
                    existed in his military. Unlike some of his predecessors, he was not a
                    “puritan”; he liked informality. The situation in Turkey in the late 1980's and
                    early 1990's was not like today; there wasn't that sharp cleavage between the
                    secular and the religious as you have today. There were plenty of people who
                    thought Ozal was a “closet” fundamentalist, but I never saw any evidence that he
                    had an Islamic agenda. He was a devout Muslieven though sometimes he took an
                    alcoholic beveragbut I don't think that had much, if any, influence on Ozal's
                    political and governmental agendas.</p>
                <p>The Turkish military was not the easiest societal sector to deal with. I don't
                    know whether they ever disclosed much information to us. I felt, as is true in
                    other similar situations, that its relationship with the U.S. was through our
                    military and not the embassy. I saw them often, in part to provide information
                    that Ozal had not passed on to them. I tried to develop a close relationship
                    with the Turkish military leaders; I think on the surface it appeared perfectly
                    civil, but I never reached the point at which I could pick up the phone and chat
                    with a senior officer. The relationships were very formal. I would be invited
                    occasionally to their homes. I would invite the leadership periodically;
                    sometime they would show up and sometime only one or two. It was uneven.</p>
                <p>Military to military relationships were, as far as I could see, quite good. We
                    were NATO partners; Turkey depended on us for more modern weapons. I think
                    everybody recognized that we were the key component of Turkish security. The
                    military to military relationship may not have been as close as they were in
                    Korea where both belonged to a unified command, but they were close. Even with
                    the U.S. military, I felt relationships were pretty formal, even though they
                    were deeply involved in Turkish military affairs through our military assistance
                    program and our presence on Turkish bases. I would characterize U.S.-Turkish
                    military relationships as close but not warm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me move to another aspect of your job. Did you have
                        much pressure from American interest groups (e.g., Greek American, Armenian
                        American, Turkish American)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I spent a lot of time with Armenian Americans primarily on the
                    genocide issue. We discussed the issue at great length particularly during the
                    period in 1990 when the Senate was fighting over a resolution of condemnation,
                    which I described earlier. These conversations were held in Washington when I
                    would return for consultations. I think they perceived me as being dispassionate
                    and able to see the various aspects of the issue. They knew what I was doing on
                    the Hill; they were not thrilled by my position against the genocide resolution,
                    but I had reviewed the situation as I saw it with some of them and they
                    understood where I was coming from. As I suggested earlier, this was one of the
                    most difficult moral issues that I had ever confronted in my work, but as a
                    representative of the U.S. government, I felt had to be concerned by the
                    practical aspects of the situation and the needs of the U.S.</p>
                <p>I spent less time with the Greek-American community. I didn't spend much time on
                    the Cyprus issue and had very little contact with Greek government, except for
                    that one session I mentioned earlier with the Greek prime minister. Senator
                    Sarbanes, the voice in Congress of the Greek-American community, spent a few
                    minutes during my confirmation hearings to air his views of the Greece-Turkey
                    situation, but it was mostly for the record. Periodically, when I would return
                    from Ankara, I would call on him to bring him up to date; we obviously disagreed
                    on the situation, but he was always cordial and very well informed.</p>
                <p>I should mention that in November 1990 I was offered the presidency of the
                    Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I decided to take it, but I informed
                    the board that I could not accept it formally until the Gulf War was over. I
                    informed the Department of the offer and my response. Then the Kurdish migration
                    occurred and I told Carnegie that I could not take the position until that
                    problem was resolved. I hoped that by the summer of 1991 that problem would be
                    resolved. The Kurds indeed were returned to their homes by July and that was the
                    end of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:. How was the Washington backstopping?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I was satisfied with the support I got from Washington after Iraq's
                    invasion of Kuwait. As I had done in Thailand, I came back for consultations
                    frequently. Also having the advantage of knowing many of the senior policy
                    makers both in State and in Defense. I could always speak with them if
                    necessary, and frequently did. For example, I would always call on Secretary of
                    Defense Cheney during my trips back. Relations with the NSC were close and
                    exceedingly helpful. Nick Burns kept us well informed of president-to-president
                    communications as well as assuring that certain actions took place. Towny
                    Friedman was very good as the country director in State and we talked frequently
                    by phone. He was smart and active. I had contacts with Secretary Baker. So I had
                    no problem getting senior officials to focus on the small number of issues that
                    I raised. For example, with the help of Bob Zoellick, then the counselor of the
                    Department, and over the opposition of EUR, we got the U.S. government to issue
                    a statement in support of Turkey's membership in the Ethe first we had made. Now
                    its almost a monthly occurrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we end this interview, I would like to spend a
                        little time on your post-Foreign Service work. In 1991, you retired and
                        accepted an appointment as president of the Carnegie Endowment. What
                        conclusions have you reached about the involvement of the private sector in
                        U.S. foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABRAMOWITZ: I don't think that anything that I have done in the private sector
                    has been as meaningful or as important as what I did in the government.</p>
                <p>For the last sixteen years we have witnessed a vast expansioalmost explosioof
                    “think tanks.” There were of course “think tanks” in 1991, but they were not
                    nearly as numerous or as well funded as they are today. “Think tanks” have been
                    players all along providing intellectual contributions for policy setting and
                    often shelter for government officials whose party may have just been voted out
                    of power, who wish to continue their absorption in policy matters and who look
                    forward to their party returning to power so that they could return to
                    government positions. This ability to provide a setting for the “revolving
                    door”, in addition to the intellectual ferment good think tankers can provide,
                    has given “think tanks” a considerable degree of importance in the Washington
                    dialogue. Their input has often been quite meaningful, although I don't want to
                    suggest that “think tanks” always make important contributions; like all human
                    endeavors, they also fall prey to proposing “intellectual garbage” and
                    sometimes, as a group, loudly supporting ideas that have very little merit. Many
                    have access to important officials and use it. “Think tanks” are players in the
                    development and occasionally the implementation of foreign policy. By and large,
                    but not always, their involvement has been useful. Information overload has
                    become a permanent fixture of our scene.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Of course, we have to remember that “think tanks” are not monolithic; they do not
                    speak with one voice. It is hard to generalize about their effectiveness and
                    usefulness in policy making. The other problem is that these organizations
                    contribute to the short-sightedness of American politics. Our politics are
                    already much too near-sighted; i.e., what should we do tomorrow and what impact
                    will that have on a party's political standing. I can't say that this problem
                    originated with the “think tanks”, but they do contribute to it through their
                    activities. The advent of the Internet with its blogs exacerbates that tendency
                    and increases the shrillness of discourse. Their contributions often create
                    confusion as well as animosity and division. The babble of voices sometimes
                    clarifies policy and sometimes creates more confusion. It is a mixed bag. The
                    profusion of “think tanks” has increased the impression of influence. All you
                    have to do is to read a newspaper or listen to a news broadcast to see how often
                    an individual associated with one of these private institutions is quoted. There
                    is no question in my mind that today “think-tanks” are a relevant part of the
                    foreign policy process. How important they are is a matter for controversy, but
                    that they are a participant is not questionable.</p>
                <p>When I was president of the Carnegie Endowment, I was more interested in efforts
                    to create institutions than I was in specific policy development except for a
                    few issues like the Balkans. We expanded our interest in such subjects as
                    immigration, non-proliferation, etc. But I spent much of my time on efforts to
                    establish and expand two institutions:1) a Russian-American “think tank” in
                    Moscow which was Carnegie first attempt to establish a presence overseas since
                    World War II and 2) the creation of the International Crisis Group, which was
                    established over a period of two years in the Endowment.</p>
                <p>On the first, I think that the Carnegie's Moscow Center has turned out to be a
                    very successful and useful enterprise, particularly as a tool to advance open
                    intellectual discussion in Russia as well as advancing internationally. It has
                    become a prominent platform for discussions and presentation of varying point of
                    view, which had been absent until the end of the Soviet Union. It was
                    essentially a free-wheeling “think tank” very much like what we see in the U.S.
                    and that was precisely the purpose we had in mind. The Moscow institute has been
                    alive and well for thirteen-fourteen years; it has expanded significantly since
                    its birth and has become a model for Jessica Mathews, the current Carnegie
                    president, in her efforts to establish similar institutions in the Middle East
                    and China, her vision of a global think tank. The founding of the Moscow
                    institute naturally took a lot of my time. I and my deputy were constant
                    visitors.</p>
                <p>The crisis group had little to do with the Carnegie “think tank”, but I thought
                    it was worth all the time and effort that it took to establissome two yearto get
                    it effectively underway. If you want more information about that group, go to
                    www.crisisgroup.org. I am proud of the work that group has done. It started with
                    3 people and a 2 million budget and has grown to 140 people and a 16 million
                    dollar budget. It is working in some 30 countries. It is an indispensable source
                    for anyone interested in detailed foreign policy. It has worked hard to
                    establish an effective advocacy effort, which is quite impressive.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I was particularly impressed by the very weak governmental responses to the
                    disintegration of Yugoslavia and to the Rwandan genocide. It was these two
                    events which were the genesis for the International Crisis Group. I wanted to
                    establish an organization which would provide a continuing on-the-ground
                    analysis of a situation. I thought that any analysis far removed from the
                    action, as in most think tanks, could not provide adequate support to the policy
                    makers or “get a seat at the table.” This was particularly true for pre-conflict
                    and actual conflict situations. Continuing analysis from the scene was essential
                    in coming up with recommendations for actions to help prevent or contain such
                    conflict. The Crisis Group is an analytical organization, a prescriptive
                    organization and an advocacy organization.</p>
                <p>It began in Sierra Leone; but got a real push when George Soros gave us $800,000
                    to monitor the Dayton Accords which were seen then as the key to maintaining
                    peace in Bosnia. Efforts were focused on what was happening to the parties, to
                    highlight deviations from the Accords and recommend corrective actions. As you
                    can well imagine, our goals brought us into frequent conflict with the U.S.
                    government on issues of post-Dayton management activities and particularly on
                    what to do about Kosovo. Since we were a private group, there wasn't anything
                    the U.S. government could do about our activities. Furthermore, General Wes
                    Clark was frequently on the same “wave length” with us on what to do in Kosovo
                    and spent considerable time with ICG as well as later becoming a board member.
                    So ICG expanded from Sierra Leone to the Balkans and to many other countries.
                    Indispensable to this grown was Garth Evans, former foreign minister of
                    Australia and president of ICG for fourteen years. I am convinced that in
                    certain cases ICG had a real impact on the decision making. The main goal was to
                    get governments to take actions which for one reason or another they did not
                    want to do. James Baker's statement on Yugoslavia that we “didn't have a dog in
                    that race” in 1992 was a disastrous one. ICG insisted that the U.S. government
                    behave otherwisand it sometimes did.</p>
                <p>I did spend a lot of time on the management of the traditional functions of the
                    Carnegie Endowment as well as doing a good bit of writing, mostly op-eds,
                    articles, and speeches. So my six years at Carnegie were very busy indeed. My
                    vantage point enabled me to see gaps in the governmental policy process.</p>
