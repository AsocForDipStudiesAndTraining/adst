                <p>AMBASSADOR MARSHALL GREEN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 2, 1995</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 2, 1995. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Marshall Green. This segment of the interview will be devoted
                        mainly to the Japanese connection. We'll also fill in concerning Australia
                        and some of Ambassador Green's earlier assignments. Mr. Ambassador, could
                        you tell me a bit about your family, your date of birth, and when and where
                        you grew up. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was born on January 27, 1916, which means that I've just turned 79. I
                    was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts. My father was a wool manufacturer and also a
                    lawyer. He was sort of a champion of the New England textile industry in
                    Washington, DC. He “lobbied” for them, quite apart from his being the chairman
                    of the Farr Alpaca Company, which at the time was the second largest wool
                    manufacturing concern in New England. It handled not only wool but also mohair,
                    cotton, and other fabrics. We had a beautiful home, called Meadow View of which
                    not a trace remains today, the house having been burned down and its 300 acres
                    bulldozed to make way for Route 90 interstate and the rest for estate
                    development.</p>
                <p>My parents loved to travel. We went abroad to Europe, just about every summer
                    after I was seven years old. My whole orientation was toward Europe. I knew
                    nothing about the Far East. My father's connections with the Far East were
                    simply as spokesman for the woolen industry. He fought against imports of
                    textiles from Japan, always trying to raise the tariffs on them. How well I
                    remember his declamatory performance before the House Ways and Means Committee
                    and the National Industrial Conference Board of which he was once chairman.</p>
                <p>My father and mother were great travelers, spending most of their summers in
                    Western Europe where father pursued his interests in pre-history as chairman of
                    the American School of Pre-History, and mother pursuing her interests in art and
                    architecture. My two sisters and I accompanied them on all these trips, though
                    we were left in a small summer school in Houlgeth, France, for four of those
                    months while they traveled about Europe.</p>
                <p>Both of our parents were great readers, with father concentrating on Sir Walter
                    Scott and on British voyages (which he read aloud to us on many an evening) and
                    mother immersed in Jane Austin and meeting the people.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>As far as schooling was concerned, my sisters and I attended a small private
                    school of which mother was principal benefactor, before I went on to two years
                    at Indian Mountain School and then six years at Groton school. My four
                    subsequent years at Yale, were, I fear, largely taken up with sports and an
                    active social life, with too little time devoted to the serious pursuit of my
                    areas of concentration in French literature and American government.</p>
                <p>This is all by way of background. It meant that, when I finally went to Japan, I
                    had no familiarity with East Asia. There was nothing in my whole background that
                    entitled me to be Ambassador Joseph C. Grew's secretary. So that's my
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made these trips to Europe, and your father was
                        involved in trade matters. Did you have any interest at Groton and Yale
                        about the Foreign Service and working for the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I moved in circles that knew little about the Foreign Service, except that
                    my school, Groton, had many illustrious graduates, including [President]
                    Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Sumner Wells [Under Secretary of State during World
                    War II], Governor Averell Harriman, and people like that. So there was a
                    tradition at Groton of men going into public service. In fact, its well-known
                    Rector, Endicott Peabody, continually used the pulpit to exhort young men to get
                    out there in the world and to serve society. The motto of our school was, “Qui
                    Servir est Regnare,” which means, “To serve Him is to reign.” That did have its
                    impact upon me. There's no question that the Rector at Groton had a great impact
                    upon me.</p>
                <p>One of his graduates was Joseph C. Grew, who was Ambassador to Japan before World
                    War II [1932-1942]. He later served as Under Secretary and Acting Secretary of
                    State, and it was he who eventually asked me to be his private secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the timing? When had you graduated from
                        Yale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I graduated from Yale in 1939. I was already enrolled in the Law School,
                    when I overheard two people in French class, I think it was, talking about Grew
                    looking for a private secretary. So I went down to Washington, DC, to apply for
                    the job. Quite frankly, one of the requirements to be his private secretary was
                    to have gone to his old home school, Groton. In fact, he used to ask Endicott
                    Peabody to suggest someone who would take that job on. He had four such private
                    secretaries over the course of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So I went down to Washington and was interviewed by Ambassador Grew. We had lunch
                    at the Metropolitan Club and then went back to his house on Woodland Drive. I
                    was talking to him when suddenly a voice came through the wall, saying, “Whom
                    are you speaking to, Joe dear?” He said, “I'm speaking to Marshall Green.” She
                    said, “Who is he, for heaven's sake?” He said, “He's interested in being my
                    private secretary.” “Oh,” said this voice, trailing off. Then I resumed the
                    conversation with the Ambassador. Again through the wall came this voice, “Ask
                    him, Joe, if he plays bridge.” The Ambassador asked, “Do you play bridge, Mr.
                    Green?” I said, “I'm crazy about bridge, Mr. Ambassador.” He said, “He's crazy
                    about bridge, Alice.” Her voice came back, “Well, take him, Joe, take him, and
                    let's get it over with.” So I became one of two leading candidates through that
                    conversation, and eventually the other candidate was eliminated when it became
                    known to the Rector the other candidate had rather rigged the election against
                    me to be captain of Groton's football team in 1934.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was freshly out of Yale, having graduated in June. By October I was on
                    my way to Japan. The process moved that fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this October, 1939?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War II had just started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. World War II had just started. I was driving west on my way to Japan,
                    spending a good deal of time visiting friends. I went all over the place. I
                    remember that it was in Eureka, California, that I overheard the report of the
                    outbreak of war in Europe.</p>
                <p>So I joined Ambassador Grew in San Francisco and went out on the “Tatsuta Maru”,
                    a Japanese liner. I put my Ford convertible in the hold of the ship. It was
                    transported to Japan for $50. I had it during the whole time I was in Japan.
                    Finally, I sold it to the younger brother of the Emperor before I left. Then it
                    was painted maroon, because all of the Imperial family cars had to be maroon in
                    color. That is just a sidelight.</p>
                <p>So I went out to Japan. It was during our transpacific trip that I got to know
                    Mrs. Grew, who was to be a great bridge companion. Then en route to Japan, I
                    played golf with the Ambassador in Hawaii. I shot about the best score that I
                    ever had. That endeared me to him, and I became his constant golf companion in
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you were brand new and really still “wet behind
                        the ears” when you arrived in Japan. How did you view Japan at that time?
                        How did it appear in your eyes in 1939?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. I had very little in the way of background, except that I was highly
                    knowledgeable about geography. I was also interested in demography, being
                    convinced that the expansionism of Germany, Italy, and Japan was rooted in
                    population pressures of those crowded countries. So I went to Japan, knowing all
                    about the geography and demography of the area, but almost nothing of its
                    politics and little of history and culture.</p>
                <p>I arrived in mid-October 1939 as a freshly minted, potential Foreign Service
                    Officer, but I wasn't in the Foreign Service. I was being paid out of Ambassador
                    Grew's own pocket the princely sum of $50 a month, for which I wrote out the
                    checks, and he signed them. But on $50 a month I could live pretty well because
                    my Embassy compound apartment was free and many of us converted US dollars on
                    the black market in China into yen at four times the rate you could get in
                    Japan. We could do that through colleagues and friends in China. That was
                    illegal, but everybody did it, except the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, since we saw Japan as a potential enemy, it wasn't terribly
                    hard to square my New England conscience with this kind of activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the Japanese system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I never claimed to know much about how the Japanese system operated and I
                    had to depend on the Embassy viewpoint of others whom I encountered. Of course,
                    I was more impressed by the views of Ambassador Grew who showed me his daily
                    diary entries. I was also influenced by the views of senior Embassy officers
                    like Gene Dooman and Ned Crocker or more junior ones like Max Schmidt and Jim
                    Espy. I also had many good friends in the diplomatic and consular corps both in
                    Tokyo and Yokohama. But, as you can see, I had almost no Japanese friends except
                    those with whom I played football and golf or whom I met at Embassy social
                    functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Turbulent Era,” for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I read that book, and that decided me to go into the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. Well, anyway, I can tell you this. I wasn't very helpful to Grew,
                    except socially. I didn't know anything about Japan. I wasn't a very serious
                    student of Japan. I never wrote any reports for him about Japan or took on a
                    particular subject, as, indeed, one of my predecessors, Jeff Parsons—J. Graham
                    Parsons—had done. He'd been with Grew for three or four years and had become
                    very helpful to Grew. My successor, Bob Fearey, also became most useful to Grew,
                    being deeply involved in events that occurred just before Pearl Harbor. And
                    then, during their incarceration, he helped to put together Grew's report to
                    Secretary Hull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was there for almost two years—not quite. A year and three-quarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I left Japan in May, 1941. My feelings about Japan at that time, as I say,
                    were very much shaped by Grew and by the people around him. Eugene Dooman was
                    the Counselor of the Embassy, was born in Japan, and spoke Japanese absolutely
                    fluently. Grew didn't speak a word of Japanese, nor did Mrs. Grew. I was shocked
                    at that. He and Mrs. Grew had been in Japan for many years. She had been there
                    as a young girl and later on as the wife of Ambassador Grew. The Ambassador had
                    already been in Japan for about seven years when I arrived there. I remember
                    that on Thanksgiving Day, 1939, when we were down in Kobe to take the train back
                    to Kyoto, where we were staying, they didn't even know how to say, “Where is the
                    train to Osaka or Kyoto.” They couldn't speak a word of Japanese.</p>
                <p>I don't really believe that Ambassador Grew had very much, first-hand information
                    about the inner workings of the Japanese system. He relied for his information
                    on the Japanese Foreign Ministry, on the Imperial Household, on the ministerial
                    group, on his Foreign Service colleagues, and on his diplomatic colleagues. At
                    the same time, he had an infinite capacity for detail. He worked very hard and
                    conscientiously. He applied himself to the task. He “lived” the problems.</p>
                <p>One could criticize Grew, as many did, for being too pro-Japanese, for being too
                    oriented toward Japanese goals, rather than, say, Chinese, American, or other
                    goals. That's unfair. The fact of the matter is that he was a great American
                    statesman. He thought in broad-minded terms. One must admit, nevertheless, that
                    he was always hopeful, always playing for the chance that Japan might straighten
                    itself out, that maybe by one more diplomatic effort we could avoid what seemed
                    to be an almost inevitable Armageddon. He tried every route to see if there
                    wasn't some way to avoid war.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>What he was warning Washington about all the time was this: we're talking awfully
                    “tough” back in Washington, but we don't have the stick to back that up. We
                    ought to be damned careful about being as “tough” as we were regarding economic
                    sanctions or holding back on shipments of scrap, ships, planes, or even oil,
                    which was the most critical of all. If we (including the UK, Holland, France,
                    etc.), were going to embargo shipments to Japan of these things (especially
                    oil), Japan is going to be driven to the wall, and we were going to find
                    ourselves at war with Japan, inevitably. But he was always wondering whether
                    there wasn't some way out of that.</p>
                <p>Of course, meanwhile, we were already well into World War II. During the first
                    half or three-quarters of my first year there, it was a “phony” war. Then the
                    situation became very serious when Japan joined the Tripartite Axis.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Ambassador Grew was “distant” from the fighting which was going on in
                    China. He was “distant” from the Manchukuo puppet empire there [in Manchuria]. I
                    think that a lot of people in Washington—and, certainly, people in our Embassy
                    in China—felt that Grew really didn't understand what a horrible machine the
                    Japanese Army was and the cruelties that they visited upon the Chinese. Well,
                    now, Grew did know that. So these comments aren't fair. On the other hand, if
                    you don't experience these things at first hand and don't see or hear or live
                    through them, you're always going to be seen as not knowing the real, inside
                    truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he make any effort to get out and around, or could he
                        have done so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I don't think that he did enough of that. I also think that he
                    should have gone back to Washington once or twice to pursue his case, because he
                    had a very good case. However, you have to remember that traveling to
                    Washington, in those days, took at least a month or two. Even if you took Pan
                    American Airways, which was just starting its transpacific route, you still had
                    to go by ship all the way down to Manila or Hong Kong to take the flying boat.
                    So it was very difficult to communicate in person with Washington. On the other
                    hand, you could pick up a phone, but the phone was insecure. There was another
                    problem, and that was the problem of coded communications. Grew did not know
                    about “Magic,” in other words, that we had broken the Japanese [diplomatic]
                    code, although I don't think that we had broken it much before Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was pretty close to the time of Pearl Harbor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: There's one thing that one must always remember. That is, if you do have
                    access to “Magic,” as they called it, you may feel that you are in the know with
                    superior knowledge in relationship to those without access to broken coded
                    messages. Therefore, there is a tendency that outsiders' views are not given the
                    weight that they would otherwise be given by insiders.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Back in Washington Secretary of State Hull was privy to “Magic,” as well as
                    President Roosevelt, presumably. I don't know whether Dr. Stanley Hornbeck was
                    privy to “Magic.” He was the head of the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs. Whatever
                    it was, this was an “angle” which, I think, was worth taking into
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Grew have access, as Ambassadors often do, to “movers
                        and shakers” in Japan who came in to meet with him and discuss various
                        issues over cigars, and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, there were, of course, lots of people who would come in and who had
                    various kinds of experience. Especially journalists. The newsmen tended to get
                    around. Obviously, in Japan they were subject to censorship. The extent to which
                    they knew things and were able to communicate them back to their home offices
                    was not too good. It isn't as if there were well informed newsmen of the type
                    you have today. There were some. But mostly there was lots of information
                    dealing with little issues or scandals involving individuals. But when it came
                    to knowing the real “inside” of what the Emperor, the Japanese military and
                    particularly the Army, or the people who “really mattered” were thinking, there
                    was very little way of knowing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our military attach�s? Did they have any
                        particular entree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The attach�s did have some entree to the military, to the Japanese Navy,
                    but very little to the Japanese Army. After all, the Navy had had more foreign
                    connections than the Japanese Army. The Japanese Army, though, was politically
                    more powerful than the Japanese Navy, and really ran the whole “show.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point Japan was more or less under a military
                        dictatorship, or a military oligarchy, or what have you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. The Army was “calling the tune,” getting ever more deeply involved in
                    Manchuria and then in China. It made heavy demands, both in terms of finances
                    and personnel. What is hard to say is the extent to which the Emperor would
                    prevail if he were to take a strong stand against what the Army wanted. Or would
                    the Army simply find some way of “hushing him up.” One never knew. I think that
                    Grew was making his “pitch” very much to the Imperial Household and the
                    Emperor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, really, it took place through intermediaries: people like Marquis
                    Kido, Count Kalbayana, and Baron Maeda. They all had connections with the
                    Imperial Family. He invited the brothers of the Emperor to the Embassy for
                    dinner parties and things like that. Obviously, the Emperor knew a lot about
                    Ambassador Grew. We went through the formal “bows” at the Imperial Palace once a
                    year—or twice a year, in his case. But, by and large, the Emperor was “out there
                    somewhere.” Ambassador Grew had these intermediaries through their insights into
                    how the Emperor felt. On the whole, he felt that the Emperor could exercise a
                    beneficial and stabilizing influence in a country that otherwise seemed to be
                    plunging rather relentlessly toward war, thanks to the powerful position of the
                    military, especially the top generals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the Embassy at the time about the
                        Japanese invasion of China? Where was it going, what did it mean, and how
                        would it play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the Embassy was involved in all kinds of protests that came out of
                    the situation in China, like the sinking of the USS PANAY [a gunboat on Yangtze
                    patrol which was sunk by Japanese bombers].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That was in 1937, I think. These were incidents which occurred in which
                    Japanese force resulted in the killing or injury of Americans or damage to their
                    property or interests. Those were things that had to be taken up in Tokyo by
                    Ambassador Grew.</p>
                <p>I am not aware that Ambassador Grew had much first-hand knowledge of what was
                    going on in China. Even if he did, I'm not sure that it would have changed his
                    thinking. The fact that he was continually trying to “get through” and
                    ingratiate and commend, which is the typical way a diplomat functions, was seen
                    by some as being “soft” toward Japan. However, I think that when you read his
                    diary, you realize that there is no “softness” there. He was just trying to use
                    all of the diplomatic arts to keep peace.</p>
                <p>During those last six months before the Pearl Harbor attack (I had left Japan in
                    May), Grew was involved in a major effort through Prince Konoye to try to set up
                    a meeting between Konoye and President Roosevelt in Alaska, in which the two
                    leaders would get together and come to some agreements which would at least have
                    staved off war. I think that Grew felt that President Roosevelt would welcome
                    such a development, because Roosevelt was so anxious to keep supplies going to
                    Europe and keep our Navy [in the Atlantic] to protect British merchant ships
                    carrying supplies to beleaguered Britain. If the United States became involved
                    in a war in the Pacific, it would have been quite a blow to our total capacity
                    to help Britain in its beleaguered hours. So I think that Grew felt that
                    Roosevelt would be sympathetic to some efforts [in this direction], and there
                    was some evidence that Roosevelt was.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>This brings up the whole question of Dr. Stanley Hornbeck and his extraordinary
                    powers. I don't recall if I ever met him or not. However, we are talking about a
                    man who was a presence we felt very strongly [in the Embassy] in Tokyo. He was
                    the equivalent of the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
                    Affairs. His official title was Director of Far Eastern Affairs in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>He was born in China of missionary parents, or perhaps his father was a
                    businessman. Anyway, he was brought up in China. He was pro-Chinese in his
                    viewpoint and very anti-Japanese. Ambassador Grew used to send copies of daily
                    entries in his diaries to Hornbeck in the hope that Hornbeck would be able to
                    see the issues in a more balanced way and realize what Grew was trying to do.
                    But I think that Grew was dealing with a man [Hornbeck] whose views were rigidly
                    set and who was very bitterly anti-Japanese, as anybody whose experience was in
                    China would make him. The difficulty was that Ambassador Grew's communications
                    with Washington were by cable. There were almost no telephone calls. It was all
                    done by telegram. The telegrams went to Hornbeck before they went to Secretary
                    Hull. Or, if they went to the White House, Hull would be asked to comment and
                    would ask Hornbeck [for his views]. So Hornbeck's input became rather governing,
                    with regard to Washington's reactions to [what Grew reported or
                    recommended].</p>
                <p>This became a very major issue just before Pearl Harbor. I had left Japan, and my
                    successor, Bob Fearey, was deeply involved. He's written articles about this
                    whole episode that deserve careful reading.</p>

                        Ambassador Grew in the Embassy in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: My duties were largely of a social nature. I made the seating arrangements
                    for luncheons and dinners. “Chief of Protocol” would be a better description of
                    what I did. I had to take the inventory of the wine cellar of the Embassy. I had
                    to handle the checkbooks and keep the Ambassador's local accounts. Not his
                    investments, of course, since we are talking about his expenditures from day to
                    day. I often played bridge with Mrs. Grew and golf with the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>I had played football during my years at Yale—on the 150 pound team. I found
                    myself playing football in Japan and was eventually elected to the “All-East
                    Japan Football Team.” I remember playing football on New Year's Day in both 1939
                    and 1940. In 1940 I had to change my clothes immediately from morning suit
                    (after attending a palace reception) to football clothes in the Ambassador's
                    stand-by limousine, with shades drawn, while I sped from the Imperial Palace to
                    Korakuen Stadium, where we won handily against the All-West Japan Team from the
                    Kansai, the Osaka-Kobe area.</p>

                        Let's start with, say, Eugene Dooman. What was his relationship...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I think that Dooman had a profound influence on Ambassador
                    Grew—probably disproportionately so, because of his knowledge of Japanese and
                    his background in Japan. He shaped Grew's thinking to a large extent. There were
                    others around Grew, like Ned Crocker, a First Secretary who was later to become
                    my father-in-law; Stuart Grummon, the other First Secretary; and “Chip” Bohlen,
                    Second Secretary, who had a lot of expertise regarding the Soviet Union and had
                    come to Tokyo direct from Moscow. These were all able people who had a marked
                    influence on Grew's thinking. However, I would quickly add that the Japanese
                    whom I earlier mentioned had a lot of influence on him, as did some of the
                    American newsmen, either stationed in the Tokyo area—the ones who spoke English
                    and ran the “Japan Times,” the Fleischers—people like that had influence on the
                    Ambassador's thinking.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, there were lots of distinguished visitors who came through
                    Tokyo. The Ambassador would meet with them. So he had a wide exposure to other
                    people's thinking on world problems, quite apart from the fact that he had a
                    long background in diplomacy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the Embassy, either
                        professionally or otherwise? This was the first glimpse you had of an
                        Embassy family. How did Grew and Dooman run the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: By today's terms it was not a big Embassy, which meant that personal
                    relationships were closer than is usual today, with Grew and Dooman heading up
                    the Embassy family.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I had a feeling that the Westernized Japanese, mostly “Nisei” (second
                    generation Japanese-American) who came back to Japan, stayed out of politics.
                    They talked very little. For the most part people were pretty damned
                    super-cautious about expressing their opinions and views, because there was the
                    “Kempeitai,” and other police and thought control organizations. People had to
                    be careful. It wasn't as bad as we've seen in some of the dictatorships in
                    modern times, but it was approaching that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that when you traveled around Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I felt it. I can't say that I traveled very much around Japan. I wish
                    that I had traveled more. I did take one long trip which took me through Korea,
                    Manchukuo, and North and Eastern China. I was carrying messages and materials
                    for our Embassy in Peking, as well as to our Consulates in Shanghai and Mukden,
                    which is now Shenyang. I must say that, having taken that trip, I had a rather
                    different view of Japan. You saw Japan from a different standpoint, and it was a
                    critical one. Of course, things were almost chaotic in China, but clearly, the
                    Japanese were invaders and ruthless occupiers of neighboring countries, that's
                    all. There was no other way of looking at it. I might say that, after taking
                    that trip, I was more anti-Japanese than I had been. Frankly, I was rather
                    “spoiling” to go to war with Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a common attitude...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I felt more strongly about these issues than did almost all my US
                    contemporaries. If I could just read from a letter to my father, it will give
                    you a little bit of what I felt. I didn't come across this letter until I was
                    preparing for this interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the date of this letter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The date of the letter is August 8, 1940. After deploring widespread
                    isolationism in the United States, including my father to some extent and
                    certainly many of my classmates of Yale, I went on to write: “Isn't it strange
                    that the usually impetuous youth, red-blooded, go-getting youth, the back bone
                    of totalitarian parties abroad, in America are so defeatist, so lacking in the
                    qualities which built our nation. We are over civilized”—these are my
                    words—”Over-humored by the good fortune to which we have fallen heir. Where the
                    youth of other lands are aggressive, we are retracting, and our doom, like that
                    of the Greek and Roman civilizations, is sealed when we produce, in our
                    declining years, men not willing to fight for what they have. American support
                    for material aid to the Allies comes from older men, wiser men, like Nicholas
                    Murray Butler [Chancellor of Colombia University at the time] or Henry Stimson
                    [former Secretary of War and of State], and, please note, World War veterans,
                    such as General Pershing. But from the youth, only isolated instances. I have
                    read with delight the opinions of many of our university presidents, leading
                    educators, novelists, and journalists and with equal disgust the opinions of the
                    youth they instruct. I tell you, it is a dangerous condition that we are in,
                    when a nation-wide appeal for enlistments brings in only 9,000 enlistees, of
                    which only a fraction are able to meet the physical requirements. Conscription
                    we must have and will have. It is the only way, maybe, that we can condition our
                    cloistered, theorizing youth to realities.” So, these were my thoughts.</p>

                <p>GREEN: I felt very strongly about it.</p>

                <p>GREEN: They divided our class at Yale very sharply. In 1939 we could see the war
                    coming. We had already seen what Neville Chamberlain [British Prime Minister]
                    had said and done and how the German occupation had affected Czechoslovakia. But
                    we had the “America Firsters,” as some of them were called, and Father Coughlin,
                    and some of that group...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Father Coughlin of Detroit, a Catholic priest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. These were people that I just loathed. I was quite strongly
                    pro-Roosevelt, because I could see that he was carefully and conscientiously
                    girding and conditioning America to the realities of having to go to war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you saw Grew's diaries. Did he discuss in those
                        diaries where Japan and America were moving during the time you were there?
                        How did he feel about the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I believe he was projecting events over the long term, that he saw that
                    there was enough in common between Japan and the United States—particularly the
                    Japanese he knew. He could see that their way of thinking of the world was very
                    much the same as his own and that of his friends back in the States. He felt
                    that if we could only get rid of the damnable Japanese “war machine,” things
                    would improve. Meanwhile, and this is an important thing to remember, although
                    most people forget it. The Japanese people were getting fed up with their long
                    bloody war with China. They'd lost several million men—or perhaps hundreds of
                    thousands would be a safer figure to use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not an easy war for them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No! Every family in Japan had been affected by war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Chinese fought a lot harder than they're given
                        credit for.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. Oh, the casualty rates were terrible. The Japanese were
                    really suffering and they were having to “pinch” all the time—”onion peel” as
                    they say. So the anti-war sentiment in Japan was potentially powerful. Now
                    Ambassador Grew realized this. I don't think that Dr. Stanley Hornbeck fully
                    appreciated that, nor did most Americans. When you do realize that, then there's
                    a certain realism to Grew's thought that for by keeping negotiations going, then
                    the anti-war sentiment in Japan would continue to grow to the point where there
                    would be a possible breakthrough between the leaderships of our two countries.
                    In that way, there could be peace. So I don't think that Ambassador Grew was
                    unrealistic about the possibility of peace. What I am saying is that I don't
                    think that a successful secret meeting between [Japan Prime Minister] Prince
                    Konoye and President Roosevelt was possible. They could have gotten together,
                    but to have such a meeting in secret? No. It was unrealistic to think that the
                    Japanese Army would even allow this to happen. They would certainly have
                    “bolted” and taken over power.</p>
                <p>Now [a rapprochement between Japan and the United States] might have been
                    achieved in a certain way. Grew was trying to work toward that end. People like
                    Bob Fearey and others believed that Grew's proposal [for a meeting between
                    Konoye and Roosevelt] was a fairly realistic one and might have worked. I don't
                    entirely agree with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even if there had been a Konoye-Roosevelt meeting, the
                        Japanese Army had shown that it was quite willing to go in and assassinate
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. And you have to remember this, too. The senior Japanese Army
                    officers had to think about the younger officers, the “hot heads,” under
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had just...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: These young officers were a pretty bloodthirsty lot. Once they had tasted
                    blood and become accustomed to “ruling the roost,” they would have become very
                    difficult to control. Anything that looked like “appeasement,” even if the top
                    military people had condoned it, which is totally unlikely—but if they had, you
                    still had the problem of the younger officers. And that came up in the February
                    26 incident, when some of the lower-ranking officers took over control of Tokyo,
                    for a short time, revolting against their superiors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about various groups, we had our China
                        specialists, who basically came out of missionary families. You had Eugene
                        Dooman and others, who also came out of missionary families, too. However,
                        they had two very different outlooks. While you were in Japan, was there
                        ever any effort to get American Chinese and Japanese specialists to get
                        together and talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, not that I was aware of. That's a good question, because I think that
                    nowadays the first thing that we would do would be to try to get them together.
                    Of course, we were handicapped by travel considerations before World War II, in
                    view of the distances involved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: However, it is true that we would have benefited a great deal from the
                    kinds of meetings we later had. We have had regular Chiefs of Mission meetings
                    since World War II. We didn't have that kind of opportunity earlier.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: However, I don't think that the “pro-Japanese crowd” [in the State
                    Department prior to World War II]—the people with experience in Japan—could
                    possibly have stood up to Stanley Hornbeck, who was too powerful for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is a question which came up at a later date—and
                        not too much later—in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, under Walter
                        Robertson. That bureau, from time to time, has been “dominated” by one
                        person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. It has been, although I don't think that I “dominated” it
                    when I was head of it.</p>

                        in May, 1941. First of all, how did you return to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I came back on one of the “President” liners—the “President Coolidge.”</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GREEN: I was coming back to take the Foreign Service exam. I went to a “cram
                    school” for a month or so—didn't get anything out of it—and took the exam. I
                    just barely “squeaked” through. Then came the war. I was going to be drafted. So
                    I saw an opportunity to enlist in the Navy, in the Japanese language school, and
                    I took it. So that's how I moved from Tokyo into the Navy, within eight
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to the language school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: At that time [1942] the school was located in Berkeley, California. This
                    was a “crash” course which had been launched, I'd say, at some point in 1941. I
                    got into the second group that went through the course. The groups at that time
                    were rather small. The course lasted for about a year, during which you were
                    supposed to learn Japanese, I wouldn't say that they turned out people who were
                    proficient in Japanese, although we had some very bright students. Our Navy made
                    a mistake in not accepting Japanese-Americans as language officers since most
                    had some knowledge of the language and some were bilingual. This all reflects
                    the bad prejudices against all Japanese, whatever their status and however long
                    Japanese descendants had lived in the US</p>
                <p>What was worse for us at Boulder was the order by President Roosevelt (and urged
                    by General DeWitt) that all Japanese-Americans had to be relocated 200 miles
                    East from our Pacific coast. This included our Japanese-American teachers,
                    requiring us to move the whole language school to the University of Colorado in
                    Boulder. That's where I completed my year of training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We know by experience today that one year isn't going to
                        do a great deal...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. No. It doesn't help much. You are immediately thrown into the fray. Of
                    our class of about 30 students 27 went into Combat Intelligence with a short
                    period of training in Hawaii before going out to the Pacific Islands. Three of
                    us were sent to Washington to serve in ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence.
                    That's where I was located all during the war, except for the last year of the
                    war, when I moved into “Communications Intelligence.” This office is still on
                    Nebraska Avenue, NW</p>
                <p>For me it was really a fascinating period. I did make one trip, for several
                    months, to the CBI theater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the “China-Burma-India” theater.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>GREEN: That's right. But basically I was always here in Washington. I was not
                    interpreting. I was translating—lots and lots of documents, some of them
                    fascinating. I was once given documents we took out of the I-1 submarine sunk
                    off Guadalcanal. This was a bunch of oil-soaked documents flown to Washington,
                    to the Naval laboratories in Anacostia, MD. I worked for several days and
                    translated this stuff. It was absolutely fascinating. The Chief Engineer of the
                    I-1 submarine kept careful records of all of the ships that were being built in
                    Japan for the submarine fleet, both the coastal and seagoing types. All the
                    names were listed down one side of the document followed by the specifications
                    of each ship, both those that were afloat and those that were being built—and
                    where they were being built: Ominato, Jure, Yokosuka, and Sasebo.</p>
                <p>So on this great, pullout sheet, with a minimum amount of effort, I was able to
                    get all of the details of the Japanese submarine fleet. We put out two “Fleet
                    Bulletins” on the basis of that. That's one thing that I was able to accomplish.
                    It was very typical of my whole career. I was lucky, just lucky.</p>
                <p>Another accomplishment was in communications intelligence, when I got the idea
                    that the “call signals” new ships were using related to their standardize sizes
                    and uses and to where the Japanese were building them. Therefore, we were able
                    to nail down, merely from call signs, roughly what kinds of ships they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You remember the way that the US Navy used to name ships.
                        Battleships were named after states, aircraft carriers after famous battles,
                        and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The call signs were just four letter signals. We would find out, for
                    example, that there were 200 barrels of tung oil loaded at Tientsin aboard
                    “Shiminoseki-7 Maru” with call signal JABC. We had never heard of the
                    “Shiminoseki-7 Maru,” but we could immediately deduce from its call sign the
                    size of the ship and whether it was an oiler or freighter. Of course, that was
                    immediately passed on to our air and naval commands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After looking at these documents, what was your impression
                        of how the Japanese ran their fleet?</hi>

                <p>GREEN: One reaction was that their security was terrible. Why they ever allowed
                    their soldiers to carry diaries, with gun positions sketched out in them. Now, I
                    wasn't dealing with that kind of intelligence, but our combat intelligence
                    people were. The second thing was that they had no typewriters of the kind we
                    have. Everything had to be done by longhand and then by mimeograph machine.
                    Well, now, there was a tremendous difference between the way we were doing
                    things and the way the Japanese were doing things. Most insecure of all, the
                    Japanese relied too much on code books which we had already seized.</p>

                        rank did you have [in the Navy] at the end of the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was a full lieutenant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: After “V-J Day” in August, 1945, I immediately tried to get into the State
                    Department. The Navy was reluctant to release anybody in intelligence who knew
                    the Japanese language, because they wanted these people for occupation duties
                    and things like that. So it wasn't easy getting out. Meanwhile, I took my
                    Foreign Service oral exam, and the Department accepted me, so I was in the State
                    Department. However, I was still in Navy uniform. My first job in the State
                    Department was to get other naval officers, who were Foreign Service Officers,
                    back into the State Department. I can tell you, to go up to a salt-encrusted
                    Navy captain to try to persuade him to release some of his men back to the State
                    Department wasn't easy. That was my first job.</p>
                <p>The files and records in the State Department were in a state of utter chaos. My
                    first job was working under Findley Burns, who was sort of in charge of this
                    whole process of getting people back into the Foreign Service. We had some
                    extraordinary experiences which I won't go into. They're anecdotal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't mind going into them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, one person whom we got back was Llewellyn Williams who, we thought,
                    was a Foreign Service Officer. He had the same name as a Foreign Service
                    Officer, but the man we got back—all the way from across the Pacific Ocean—was a
                    young nuclear scientist. When we got him back to Washington, he said, “Well,
                    what am I supposed to do?” We showed him his record, and he said, “I'm not that
                    man.” So we took the matter up with the head of personnel, who decided, “Well,
                    we're going to have to get into the nuclear business, so let's give him a job”
                    in this new-found field of nuclear diplomacy. He was one of the first people
                    involved in this field, simply because of our mistake.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was only in that job for a short while before I was sent to the
                    Legation in Wellington [New Zealand]. Before being commissioned an FSO and sent
                    to Wellington, I had a month's training as an FSR in consular work in the old
                    Soviet Embassy building on Connecticut Avenue.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the training like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The training was confined to learning about visas, immigration laws, and
                    consular problems. It was terribly dull. I can't say that I ever mastered it or
                    ever had much use for it. For curious reasons my career has been almost totally
                    focused in the political and especially the politico-military side. That was the
                    “growth industry” at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we move on chronologically or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Let's keep on the “Japan track.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. We'll come back at a later date to review your
                        time in Wellington, New Zealand, and Stockholm. So what was the next...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The next “tranche” of my Japan career was when, in 1947, after less than
                    two years as Third and then Second Secretary of Legation in Wellington, New
                    Zealand, I was assigned to the Japan desk in the State Department. I served
                    there from 1947 to 1950 as a Japan desk officer, working very closely with Bob
                    Fearey, who was my successor as Ambassador Grew's private secretary. He had not
                    served in the military because of a detached retina. He probably knew more about
                    current US-Japan relations than anybody in the State Department at that point,
                    because he worked [on Japanese affairs] right on through World War II. Bob and I
                    were very close friends in those years and have been ever since.</p>
                <p>We worked under John Allison, who was the “chief” of NA (Northeast Asian
                    Affairs). The deputy “chief” changed and was replaced by Max Bishop. The head of
                    the “bureau”—FE [Far Eastern Affairs]—was W. Walton Butterworth. Walt
                    Butterworth “took a shine” to me, and I found myself in his office a great deal.
                    This created some problems with John Allison, who was diplomatic enough to know
                    how to handle that one. Anyway, it was largely through Walt Butterworth that I
                    was assigned as George Kennan's only traveling companion to Japan in February,
                    1948.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>This trip turned out to be extremely important. What had happened was that when
                    the occupation of Japan was undertaken in 1945, it was our expectation that it
                    would only go on for two or three years, and then there would be a peace treaty.
                    Meanwhile, to jump ahead a little, John Foster Dulles had been “brought aboard”
                    in 1950 to try to negotiate the peace treaty with Japan. Until there was a peace
                    treaty, Japan would be under Allied occupation. Since it appeared that the
                    occupation period was going to be extended much longer than had earlier been
                    anticipated, it was strongly felt in the Office of Policy Planning in the State
                    Department, especially by George Kennan, but also by John Davies, Walt
                    Butterworth and Secretary of State George Marshall, that occupations can go
                    sour. It was felt that, in the case of Japan, we had to be very careful.</p>
                <p>So George Kennan was sent out to Japan in February 1948 by Secretary of State
                    Marshall to discuss with General MacArthur how the emphasis in the occupation of
                    Japan could be shifted from “reform” to “economic recovery.” The idea was to
                    normalize things as far and fast as one could to stave off growing,
                    nationalistic resentment against the occupation.</p>
                <p>At that time we had various mechanisms for dealing with Japan and with the
                    occupation. In Washington there was the Far Eastern Commission, on which all of
                    the countries that had been enemies of Japan had their representatives. We met
                    in the old Japanese Embassy here in Washington about once every two or three
                    weeks. I used to go to those meetings. Another international mechanism was the
                    Allied Council in Japan, on which representatives of the Great Powers sat. It
                    met periodically and discussed the broader issues. However, neither of those
                    bodies carried any weight with MacArthur. MacArthur “ran the show” the way he
                    wanted to, and to heck with all these other people. He had a little bit of the
                    same attitude toward the White House. He felt that Japan was his exclusive
                    domain. Of course, we came to learn a lot about that in Korea later on.</p>
                <p>Now, when George Kennan was sent out to Japan to talk to MacArthur about changing
                    the emphasis of the occupation, he was treated, on his arrival in Japan, just as
                    though he was a visitor from a not too friendly power. He was almost seen as a
                    “spy” from the State Department. MacArthur held him at arm's length. Of course,
                    he couldn't ignore Kennan. George Kennan had his orders, but MacArthur kept him
                    at arm's length and wouldn't meet with him, except socially—for example at a
                    dinner party.</p>
                <p>It was interesting to see how Kennan operated. Kennan got through to MacArthur
                    two ways. The State Department already had a representative in Japan in SCAP
                    [Supreme Commander, Allied Powers] headquarters, William Sebald. Bill Sebald was
                    the head of the Diplomatic Section of SCAP. There were 14 Sections in
                    SCAP—including Sebald's Diplomatic Section answerable to Major General Fox who,
                    in turn, was deputy to General Almond, a four-star general, who was chief of
                    staff of SCAP. So the State Department's representative, Bill Sebald was “way
                    down the line.”</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>George Kennan eventually got through to MacArthur by casually observing to Major
                    General Willoughby, head of SCAP Intelligence, that MacArthur should not be too
                    concerned about the views of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, whose
                    work was now largely complete. MacArthur was in the best position to judge what
                    now needed to be done in Japan, and Kennan could be of help to MacArthur in
                    getting MacArthur's views across in Washington.</p>
                <p>Through Willoughby and through my intervention with General Babcock (an old
                    friend from our service together in the Embassy before the war) it was arranged
                    that Kennan would discuss the origins and current nature of Soviet conduct in
                    the SCAP HQ briefing room where some 100 top brass were present.</p>
                <p>I found Kennan's presentation—and I suspect most others attending would
                    agree—absolutely brilliant. It was as though we were at one with eternity like
                    that old advertisement of the Rosicrucian Society, where an eye is seen,
                    piercing into eternity. Of course, all the clouds rolled in afterwards, but
                    there was a transcending moment of truth.</p>
                <p>Now, MacArthur recognized brains when he soon heard about the speech. After that,
                    all doors were open to Kennan. In fact, MacArthur provided us with a railroad
                    carriage of our own to go wherever we wanted to go. I'll come back to what we
                    wanted to talk about, but I just want to say that we did go down to Kyoto, where
                    I was left for a week to write our report at the Miysho Hotel. Meanwhile, Kennan
                    went on to Korea and the Philippines and then came back to Japan, where we
                    rejoined and returned to Washington. I did some of the writing of the
                    report.</p>
                <p>To return to the fundamentals of what Kennan was saying to MacArthur. He said
                    that we have to move as far and fast as possible toward a more normal type of
                    relationship with Japan and toward putting Japan much more on its feet and
                    taking care of itself. We must be aware that if we move too slowly, nationalism
                    will overtake us, and heaven knows what will happen. This was always presented
                    in terms suggesting that MacArthur knew this better than he did. Kennan never
                    lectured MacArthur. The kinds of things he wanted to end as quickly as
                    possible—and it was carefully targeted—included the reparations and
                    decartelization programs. He called for an end to the “purges” immediately or as
                    soon as possible. He said that the Japanese should have some kind of economic
                    representation abroad. (This last point I was to take on as my own
                    responsibility and work very hard on it.) Improvements should be made in
                    communications channels. Kennan placed the greatest emphasis on setting up
                    better internal security in Japan. He was appalled to see how the Police Force
                    was all divided up. The Japanese had inadequate means to maintain law and order
                    in the country on a national scale. He made some recommendations on how to
                    strengthen a democratic Police Force and establish a Japanese Coast Guard that
                    could protect Japan against smuggling, illegal entries, and things like that.
                    There was quite a long list of things that had to be done. All I can say is that
                    our report covered all of these points. So we returned to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, Kennan suffered from a terrible case of ulcers. Walt Butterworth, with
                    my help, really had to put this report through the National Security Council in
                    Washington, which we did.</p>
                <p>Let me go back to give you an illustration of one of the things that happened,
                    while it is still clear in my mind. While I was in Kyoto, writing up the report,
                    I was asked by some Navy friends to come down and see the Osaka docks. They
                    thought I would be shocked by what I saw. And there—stacked all down the
                    docks—was dismantled machinery from Japanese industries. The machinery was being
                    greased, crated, and shipped—at great expense and effort—to North China, as part
                    of a reparations program to China. Meanwhile, North China was being overrun by
                    the communists. The whole thing was ridiculous. The American taxpayer was paying
                    for taking machinery out of Japan, which we were meantime supporting, and taking
                    it to China, which was falling into the hands of the communists.</p>
                <p>It will not surprise you that Kennan not only spoke extremely effectively but
                    wrote even more effectively. The telegrams which Kennan sent back to Washington
                    were really bristling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, here were MacArthur and Willoughby, who was his
                        “guard dog,” you might say. Here were two men with tremendous egos,
                        particularly MacArthur. Here came Kennan—bright, and all that, but was he
                        criticizing MacArthur's handling of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No. What he was saying was that we want MacArthur to remain in charge, but
                    we wanted to anticipate and head off whatever kinds of forces that might
                    undermine his authority and effectiveness. I think that this appealed to
                    MacArthur, because MacArthur was an intelligent man. Now, where we were running
                    up against problems was with the architects of these policies in SCAP
                    headquarters, for example, the Political Section, which was headed by General
                    Whitney...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Courtney Whitney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, Courtney Whitney. His principal deputy was Colonel Kades. These
                    people had been the architects of the “purge program,” for example. They hated
                    to see it dismantled and resisted our efforts to end the purge, even though it
                    was the expressed will of our National Security Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain about the “purge”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>GREEN: The purge involved removing from public office or from top positions of
                    influence, in business or in government, those who were considered to be
                    responsible, in any major way, for the war effort. This meant, basically, anyone
                    in a prominent position was “purged.” Kennan was opposed to this way of tarring
                    everybody with the same brush, without any kind of examination of the
                    individual's record. By the way, he had also been opposed to “war crimes
                    trials,” but they were all over in Japan by the time he got there.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I would like to finish the story of the “purge,” because we had
                    difficulty ending it. Meanwhile, Walt Butterworth had been replaced by Dean Rusk
                    in 1949 as Assistant Secretary for Far East Affairs. So after two months of
                    frustrated efforts by Washington to end the purge, Rusk asked me to draft a
                    personal message for Marshall to MacArthur. I thought my draft was “pretty hot
                    stuff,” but Rusk said, “Do you think that this will turn the trick, Marshall?” I
                    said, “No, I don't think so, Mr. Secretary, but this is putting it on the
                    record.” He said, “The object is not to put it on the record. The object is to
                    stop this damned thing.” He added, “I suggest you go back and rewrite this
                    10-page telegram and make it no longer than a page and a half. Make the point
                    that MacArthur thought originally that the purge should end by this time and
                    that we'd been reluctant as had other governments in the Far Eastern Commission.
                    However, now we've come to see the wisdom of his earlier position, he should go
                    ahead and do it.”</p>
                <p>So I wrote the telegram accordingly. I gulped pretty hard because I come from New
                    England, where we have strong consciences. I knew that MacArthur had never said
                    this, but we attributed it to him. That did the trick. The purge was ended 48
                    hours later. I reminded Dean Rusk about this, many years later. He said,
                    “Marshall, I hope you don't go around telling people that story. It casts me in
                    such a cynical light.” I said, “Not at all, Mr. Secretary. It casts you in the
                    light of somebody who knows how to get things done through diplomacy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Kennan? You traveled with him.
                        He was a complex personality. He was my Ambassador in Yugoslavia. I regarded
                        him as a great intellectual, but I was not impressed with him as an
                        Ambassador. How did he strike you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I've always admired his eloquence and his ability to write and speak. His
                    mission to Japan was a great challenge to him. He rose to it, and that's why he
                    succeeded. Now, you know in his “Memoirs,” he recalls all this. He says that he
                    thinks that that trip to Japan was probably the most important thing that he
                    did, after the Marshall Plan. Then he went on to say, “Perhaps it was even more
                    important than the Marshall Plan, in the long run.” So he attached great
                    importance to this, even in retrospect.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>It was marvelous to see how he operated. I mentioned how he “co-opted” people on
                    MacArthur's staff who paved his way to MacArthur. But there was also the way
                    that he drafted reports and telegrams. It was something to behold. He would sit
                    down and start dictating. One of my jobs was to “look intelligent.” He would
                    speak to me, while Dorothy Hessman, his secretary, took it all down as a
                    telegram. So he was basically dictating a telegram to Washington while speaking
                    to me. The result was that the telegram had a kind of conversational flow that
                    made it far more effective. When he was through, he didn't have to change a word
                    of it. Articulation is something I admire in any diplomat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting? How was the occupation? Did you
                        think that it was close to “going sour?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, I don't think so. I don't think that it had gone that far. Some of the
                    reforms had been very successful—the land reform, particularly. Wolf Ladejinsky
                    had been largely responsible for that along with Bob Fearey. There were other
                    things that they had done that were successful, and MacArthur himself did very
                    well in his handling of the Emperor and the Japanese people, and the respect
                    that he showed them. This was really most commendable. On the other hand, I do
                    think that Kennan's concerns were valid. We simply had to move, “or else.” We
                    had to move in a timely way. Then you don't have to act out of weakness, in
                    response to demonstrations or protests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything to do with John Foster Dulles at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not on this trip. Of course, John Foster Dulles “came aboard” on the
                    Japanese problem in 1950. It was in the course of that year and the beginning of
                    the next year that he managed to put together the Japanese peace treaty. He
                    handled this issue with great effectiveness. I was, perhaps, the first person to
                    brief him when he came to the State Department. They gave him an office near the
                    Secretary of State's office on the fifth floor of what was called, at that time,
                    the “New State Department Building.”</p>
                <p>First of all, we put together briefing papers for him with the help of Bob Fearey
                    and INR (State's intelligence division). I had done the paper on the political
                    situation in Japan and was briefing him on that particular aspect. He was
                    sitting there, in a deep chair—kind of a sofa-like chair—his arms clasped in
                    front of him. His head was nodding. He looked to me as if he was going to sleep.
                    Finally, his breathing got so heavy that I thought that he was asleep. I just
                    tiptoed out of the room. That was my first connection with John Foster Dulles.
                    [Laughter] I didn't have much to do with him because shortly thereafter I went
                    to Sweden. That was the period when most of the work was done on the peace
                    treaty with Japan, with Bob Fearey being Dulles' principal assistant on the
                    critically important and successful project.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Japan's role in the Far East? What kind of
                        position did we see for Japan, with the Cold War on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's a very good question. Actually, I've seen very little written about
                    it. My recollection was that George Kennan favored a “neutral” solution for
                    Japan. Of course, General MacArthur did, too. You'll remember that MacArthur
                    talked about Japan being the Switzerland of the Far East. There was a kind of
                    visionary and unreal “latching on” to this idea of neutrality as the solution to
                    Japan's future, with the United States and other countries serving as guarantors
                    of Japan's neutrality. It was felt that that was the way we should proceed. Of
                    course, that would have fitted in closely with the mood of Japan at the time.
                    Meanwhile, under its constitution, Japan had been denied having armed forces. Of
                    course, much changed with the Korean War. Even so, my own feeling was that this
                    was not a solution for Japan. If you think about the Far East, you have the four
                    great powers of the world there—the United States, China, and Russia, with Japan
                    potentially as one of them. With such power converging around Korea, the idea
                    that anyone was going to respect Japan's neutrality seemed crazy.</p>
                <p>The Korean War just rubbed all of that out. If there hadn't been a war in Korea,
                    I don't know what would have happened. Nobody ever knows about things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still on the Japanese desk on June 25, 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, yes. It was a surprise. I was struck by how little we knew about
                    Korea. In our Office of Northeast Asian Affairs we had one officer working on
                    Korea who knew little about it. The fact of the matter is that, during World War
                    II, when I was in Navy intelligence, nobody in my intelligence circles was
                    concerned with or about Korea. The same was true before that, when I was in
                    Japan with Ambassador Grew. The ignorance about Korea! Even to this day there is
                    still the supposition that the Chinese Communists first came into the Korean War
                    when MacArthur appeared to be about to cross the Yalu River. The Chinese were
                    across the Yalu River a long time before that. The ignorance about Korea
                    continues to this very day.</p>

                        This makes a good point to break off. I thought that we might then take up
                        the period from 1956 to 1960, when you came back to deal with Japanese
                        affairs.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 2, Side A, of an interview with Ambassador
                        Marshall Green, still dealing with his connection with Japan. You were
                        talking about your service in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, 1956-1960,
                        during which time you worked closely with Assistant Secretary Walter H.
                        Robertson. Did Robertson agree with the way Senator McCarthy of Wisconsin
                        thought about the Far East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, his views were not as antique as that. However, he was a “dyed in the
                    wool” Republican. He was a man who believed very strongly in the “right wing
                    cause” as far as Asia is concerned, but his views were different from, and
                    opposed to, those of Senator McCarthy of Wisconsin. Moreover, he was a very
                    strong upholder of the Foreign Service. It is interesting to note that all 14 of
                    our Chiefs of Mission in East Asia and the Pacific at that time were Foreign
                    Service Officers—a record that probably has never been matched anywhere and at
                    any time in history.</p>
                <p>Now, I got along very well with Assistant Secretary Robertson. For one thing, one
                    of my first jobs was running the United Fund Campaign for the Bureau of Far
                    Eastern Affairs, which came out far ahead of its quota. To Assistant Secretary
                    Robertson that was very pleasing and cast me in a favorable light. I also wrote
                    a lot of his speeches. He liked the way that I wrote, and his speeches got good
                    reactions on Capitol Hill [Congress]. In the speeches, of course, I always gave
                    proper play to his known prejudices regarding...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a problem to write speeches for him? You were a
                        professional Foreign Service Officer, close to your political masters, but
                        at the same time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I knew what his strong views and prejudices were. I had to play them up in
                    his speeches, because they were his speeches, after all. I would present the
                    material as I knew that he would present it. It was more in discussions of
                    particular issues, where I was present, that I would sometimes mildly take
                    exception to what he was saying. It was always mild because, if it went too far,
                    that would be the end of my close association with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The one time I can recall when he “blew up” was when I took issue with him over
                    something which Syngman Rhee [President of the Republic of Korea] had done
                    regarding the seizure of Japanese fishing vessels. We had tremendous
                    responsibilities in both Korea and Japan. We were doing everything possible to
                    try to bring them together. With Syngman Rhee around, there was no chance of
                    doing that. I felt that this was a primary issue, to which Robertson was giving
                    insufficient attention.</p>
                <p>When Robertson left in 1959, Jeff Parsons succeeded him. He was an old
                    like-minded friend and career colleague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Robertson was focused on Korea and China. We are talking
                        about Japan at that time [1956-1960]. What were his interests and concerns
                        with Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I had no difficulties in writing for him or talking with him about Japan.
                    He recognized the primacy of Japan. Our overall relationships with any country
                    in that part of the world had to be based on a healthy US-Japan relationship.
                    That was something of a concession for a man like Robertson, who put so much
                    emphasis on China.</p>
                <p>The Japanese Broadcasting Company recently wanted to interview me about the
                    Security Treaty of 1960 between Japan and the United States. I said that I did
                    not have very clear recollections about that. They replied, “On the contrary. We
                    see you as being a principal architect of that treaty.” I said, “What?” They
                    said, “Yes, let us show you the documents.” Then they showed me documents which
                    they had arranged to have declassified [under the Freedom of Information Act]
                    from our archives. These showed that while working for Robertson I was the one
                    who originated the proposal for the Security Treaty of 1960 between the United
                    States and Japan. It took the form of a 17 page memorandum dated December 28,
                    1956 [to which the Japan Broadcasting Company referred] addressed to Douglas
                    MacArthur [nephew of Gen. MacArthur], who at that time was Counselor of State
                    Department, and to Bill Sebald, who was then Robertson's deputy in the Bureau of
                    Far Eastern Affairs. What I wrote was something of a reflection of what I had
                    gone through before with George Kennan [in 1948 when he was Director of Policy
                    Planning and with whom I visited Japan]. I pointed out that the Japanese
                    considered our sizable military presence in Japan as a carryover from the
                    occupation period and as a form of foreign control. Furthermore, this presence
                    had the danger of involving Japan in war because we had extensive military bases
                    in Japan which were seen by many Japanese as a kind of a magnet which might draw
                    even nuclear war to Japan. Therefore, our political position in Japan was quite
                    perilous, unless we moved very rapidly to put these bases on a mutually
                    beneficial basis. In other words, we couldn't be “dictating” to Japan. We had to
                    be “consulting” with Japan. I urged that we replace the Security Treaty of 1951
                    between the US and Japan with a truly mutual security treaty, which eventually
                    became the Security Treaty of 1960 between the US and Japan which is still in
                    force today. Judging from what's happened to NATO [North Atlantic Treaty
                    Organization], I'd say that it's even more durable than NATO.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>This long paper made specific recommendations as to how we should go about
                    negotiating a mutual security treaty with the Japanese and what in general might
                    be the terms of such a treaty. All I can say is that it received the strong
                    endorsement of the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs. Later on, actual machinery was
                    established in Japan to negotiate the treaty between our Ambassador in Japan and
                    CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific, with his headquarters in Honolulu], on the
                    American side, and the Foreign Minister of Japan and the head of their
                    Self-Defense Forces, on the Japanese side. They had all sorts of people down the
                    line, working on this negotiation and finally came up with a very good security
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>This was the principal issue regarding Japan during my years from 1956 to 1960
                    [as Regional Planning Adviser in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me focus on what is probably the most difficult,
                        adversarial issue. It was not between Japan and the United States but
                        between the Department of State and the Pentagon—over Okinawa, over bases
                        [in Japan], and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I would say, Stu, that ever since the days of General Eisenhower,
                    when he organized the National War College, there have been good working
                    relations between State and Defense. The State Department and the military were
                    prone to sneer at each other—with references made to “the military mind,” and
                    “to cookie pushers” and that kind of thing. After a while, you didn't hear that
                    so much. We had improving personal relationships and mutual interests and we
                    expressed ourselves accordingly.</p>
                <p>I think that this was very well reflected when I got back from Sweden where I had
                    been for nearly five years [1950-1955]. It was rather refreshing to find that
                    the military and the State Department were working in more constructive terms,
                    particularly in the case of Japan. The same thing might have been true in terms
                    of Europe as well.</p>
                <p>We had an interesting time negotiating the Security Treaty of 1960. Douglas
                    MacArthur had meanwhile ceased to be Counselor of the State Department and had
                    become Ambassador to Japan. He came back to Washington in 1959 to try to get the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff completely “aboard” on the new Security Treaty. He knew
                    that they were generally supportive but we still had the final steps of the
                    negotiations to complete. Ambassador MacArthur called a meeting in the Secretary
                    of State's conference room, with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on one side of the
                    table. On the State Department's side of the table were Jeff Parsons, who had
                    meanwhile taken over as Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs
                    from Walter Robertson; Ambassador MacArthur; myself; and one or two others.
                    MacArthur chaired the meeting.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I'll never forget the meeting, because a rather amusing situation arose. Doug
                    MacArthur, in his didactic way, was telling the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the
                    essence of diplomacy and how to negotiate a treaty. He said, “Gentlemen, it's
                    absolutely essential, when we sit down with the Japanese, that we know exactly
                    what we want to get out of the Japanese. We want to have our whole position
                    worked out and ready. Then we can do a real “snow job” on them.” Admiral Arleigh
                    Burke, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “You mean, Doug, the
                    way you're doing on us right now?” [Laughter] Well, I was the only one on the
                    State Department side of the table who laughed, though I quickly suppressed it.
                    That was one of the things that I found so delightful about Admiral Arleigh
                    Burke.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that treaty was negotiated. I don't want to go into all of the
                    details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave that, the United States had major bases in
                        Yokosuka and Atsugi, and Okinawa was off to one side. But these bases must
                        have led to a lot of discussion about what we were going to do with them. Or
                        were our military fairly well...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Oh, no, I'm not finished talking about the bases, because they raised
                    critical issues. All of the points you have made are valid. We had various
                    problems with our bases in Japan and the Ryukyus—and we of course had to
                    distinguish between the two, because the Ryukyus didn't revert to Japan until
                    1972. At this point we are talking about 1960. The bases in Japan and especially
                    the Ryukyus were also very important to carry out our treaty commitments in
                    other parts of East Asia. To some extent it might appear to our other allies in
                    East Asia that the Japanese had some kind of controlling hand over the use of
                    our facilities in support of missions for the defense of those other countries.
                    That could wreak havoc with the fabric of our relationships with those
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The skill was how to come up with a treaty which, on the one hand, comported with
                    Japan's feelings that it did not want to become a “lightning rod,” and that it
                    did want to be able to control all that went on in their country. At the same
                    time there were the views of the countries which were protected by our bases. I
                    think that diplomacy really triumphed in this situation. The negotiations were
                    handled with great skill by the powers that be. I take no credit for this. They
                    were handled by our ambassador, CINCPAC, the Secretary of State, as well as by
                    Japanese Prime Minister Kishi and his officials.</p>
                <p>We came up with a formula under which the treaty left it unclear as to the
                    precise extent to which we would be responsive to Japanese requests not to use
                    our bases for particular missions. In essence the formula involved an exchange
                    of letters in Washington at the end of 1960 which stated that in carrying out
                    our missions each of the parties would take into account the concerns of the
                    other party. Whatever we did would comport with Japanese concerns about not
                    having any nuclear weapons in Japan, not drawing Japan into a position of being
                    a “lightning rod,” and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>That was a very sensitive and difficult maneuver and an example of diplomacy at
                    its very best, involving some very good men at the helm in the Foreign Office
                    and the Prime Minister's Office. We had, too, especially Ambassador U. Alexis
                    Johnson, a superb diplomat.</p>
                <p>Now, you mentioned something else just now, Stu, which is very close and parallel
                    to this. That is, we had bases throughout East Asia, especially in Japan, Korea
                    and the Philippines, but increasingly elsewhere in Southeast Asia, including
                    Thailand and, eventually, Vietnam. With all these bases, we inevitably had
                    numerous problems between our forces and the local communities.</p>
                <p>The Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Frank
                    Nash, was assigned the task in 1957 of going around the world with specialists
                    in the field of politico-military affairs to see what steps we should take to
                    forestall the dangers of “blowups” as well as to improve, in constructive terms,
                    troop-community relations. I went on a long trip with Frank Nash in May 1957.
                    Also on that trip were Henry L.T. (”Barney”) Koren, Jim Wilson, Len Unger, and
                    Tim Hoopes. I was the specialist for East Asia and the Pacific. The others were
                    more or less European or Defense specialists.</p>
                <p>The first country we visited was Japan, where we had a real “blowup” over the
                    so-called Girard case. This involved an enlisted man who had shot a Japanese
                    woman who was collecting brass casings [from shells] on an artillery firing
                    range. The matter blew up overnight into a national scandal. So we had that
                    problem right off the bat. We had a similar case that I have already mentioned
                    in my oral history on China. This had to do with a GI shooting a “peeping Tom”
                    in Taiwan. I won't go into that. We had some similar cases in the Philippines.
                    Overall, the results of this trip, not just to East Asia but other trips to
                    Europe and the Middle East, did a great deal to improve troop-community
                    relations.</p>
                <p>However, my real job was that of Regional Planning Adviser. The task of a
                    Regional Planning Adviser was quite clear in Europe where we had the Marshall
                    Plan, NATO, and all other regional organizations. In East Asia we had no
                    regional organizations at all. Therefore, the region contained four divided
                    countries [Korea, China, Vietnam and Laos] and less important
                    countries—Communist China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea—were not represented
                    in the United Nations.</p>
                <p>Here let me point out that the only real unifying factor in the East Asian region
                    at that time was the United States which had close ties with most of the
                    countries of the region while those countries had generally poor or non-existent
                    relations with each other. Moreover, the more responsible we were for the
                    problems of our friends in the region, the less inclined they were to resolve
                    issues with neighboring countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Meanwhile between 1952 and 1960, the US had established military alliances with
                    Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of China and the Philippines. These
                    were all bilateral alliances and efforts to establish any multilateral alliance
                    in the region never really succeeded. SEATO collapsed, though it did have a
                    legacy of enduring US military ties with Thailand into the Rush-Thanat
                    Agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to Japan, how did we view the internal
                        situation in Japan from 1956 to 1960? Were there concerns, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't think that there were any major concerns. My recollection of the
                    internal situation in Japan is that we faced some problems regarding the status
                    of the Koreans in Japan. We also had some problems, which I mentioned before,
                    about our base-community relations. However, as far as the Japanese political
                    figures were concerned, the Liberal-Democratic Party was clearly in the saddle.
                    The democratic process in Japan, if you want to call it that—was under the thumb
                    of the well-heeled Liberal-Democratic Party, which was oriented toward the
                    United States. So we didn't have much to worry about. However, the left wing in
                    Japan was vociferous and could whip the people up, as indeed it did, on the
                    military base issue. So the situation was nothing to take for granted. We
                    worried about it a good deal. It was an incentive for us to move forward on the
                    recommendations I mentioned earlier about the need to enter into a more truly
                    bilateral mutual security relationship with Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the time when the Zengakuren, a radical student
                        movement, emerged? At that time were we concerned about some of the groups
                        in Japan really going “off?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Undoubtedly, we were, although I can't remember which they were. I know
                    that there were some troublesome groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was part of your job—and this was clearly its
                        politico-military dimension—involved in developing the position of Political
                        Advisers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That's a good point. I think that the idea originated with Bill Sebald.
                    Bill Sebald was a close friend of Admiral Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval
                    Operations, who, in turn, was a close friend of Admiral Felix Stump, who was
                    CINCPAC. Admiral Stump was a touchy salt-crusted sailor, who had the same kind
                    of suspicious attitude toward the State Department that military officers of his
                    vintage—he was well on in years—commonly had. The idea of having anybody from
                    the State Department “snooping” on him or keeping an eye on him was disturbing
                    to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>We got around this problem through the diplomacy of Admiral Arleigh Burke.
                    Arleigh sent a personal message to Admiral Stump, saying, more or less, “Felix,
                    we think that you have one of the most important jobs in the world. In addition
                    to having the best in the way of staff, you ought to have somebody on your staff
                    who knows how to get things done for you in the State Department. We have such a
                    fellow in mind. His name is John Steeves.” Sebald and I had recommended that
                    John Steeves [later Ambassador to Afghanistan and Director General of the
                    Foreign Service] be Admiral Stump's first Political Adviser. Well, to make a
                    long story short, Felix Stump got along beautifully with John Steeves, and vice
                    versa. That was the beginning of a string of Political Advisers, all of whom did
                    very well.</p>
                <p>Admiral Felix Stump was also very useful in this period in connection with
                    something else. In September, 1957, the Russians put up “Sputnik,” [the world's
                    first man-made satellite]. Secretary of State Dulles was extremely concerned
                    over this development and the implication that we were falling behind the Soviet
                    Union in the “race for space,” as well as the “race for science and technology.”
                    Dulles put out a circular asking each of the bureaus of the Department for
                    suggestions as to how we might counteract this development.</p>
                <p>Psychologically, there was need for counteraction, because in the world at large
                    the Russians appeared to be moving ahead of us. People might begin to knuckle
                    under to the Russians, thinking that they were the “wave of the future.” I don't
                    know whether the idea was John Steeves' or Arleigh Burke's or Felix Stump's.
                    However, let's give Admiral Felix Stump credit for it because he was the one who
                    carried it out.</p>
                <p>The idea was that, once a year, Admiral Arleigh Burke would conduct an
                    air-sea-ground demonstration in East Asia. The demonstration would be carried on
                    by the Seventh Fleet, with Admiral Stump as the host. He then invited the
                    Defense Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff of all of the countries in East Asia
                    to attend. Most of them came. The demonstration started at Clark Field [in the
                    Philippines], went from there to Subic Bay and Cubi Point [also in the
                    Philippines], and ended up in fleet exercises en route to Okinawa, where there
                    were Marine Corps “vertical envelopment” exercises [helicopter insertion of
                    troops on a given point], for the edification of these leaders. On top of it all
                    the Navy was able to demonstrate how quickly it could bring reinforcements and
                    supplies into the Far East from the West Coast of the United States, as well as
                    from Hawaii. It was very impressive, and I think that it left a very deep mark
                    on all of his guests, that the US was a powerful friend who could deliver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at some of the things that you were involved with,
                        was there a Japanese connection with the Taiwan Straits crisis of 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I think that there was. The Japanese were very nervous about Taiwan,
                    bearing in mind that Taiwan used to be part of the Japanese Empire, and the
                    Japanese are very conscious of being on a long chain of Islands running South
                    from the Kuril Islands right down to Taiwan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, 1956-1960, did you feel that the

                        traumatic war [World War II], we had occupied their country, and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, they were coming of age, but still very slowly. We're talking now
                    about the period 1956-1960. The Japanese were still “reeling” from the effects
                    of the American occupation. The 1960 US-Japan Mutual Security Treaty was yet to
                    be finalized. They were beginning to make real strides forward economically, but
                    as you know, this process moved rather slowly in the beginning. It wasn't until
                    1961 or 1962 that the Japanese economy began to boom. It was a bit later that
                    they began to score very rapid increases in their GNP [Gross National
                    Product].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective was their Foreign Service, their
                        representation abroad and especially in Washington? I'm trying to keep it to
                        the 1956-1960 period. We'll talk about later periods at another time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: They had very good people. Incidentally, during that period, when Prime
                    Minister Kishi came to Washington in 1957, there was no official
                    Japanese-American organization here, as there had been in Japan for many years.
                    So Kishi had no suitable organization in Washington to serve as host for an
                    occasion where he could deliver a major speech on US-Japan relations (as Grew
                    had done in Japan under the auspices of the American-Japan Society in
                    Tokyo).</p>
                <p>So, three of us Foreign Service Officers in the Far East Bureau (all specialists
                    on Japanese issues) undertook to establish the Japan-American Society of
                    Washington, DC which then hosted a dinner party for Kishi. (The Society was to
                    flourish over time, later headed by Alexis Johnson whom I succeeded as President
                    in 1985.)</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I'm not sure that they knew how to “play” Congress. They included
                    able and experienced diplomats who were true professionals, albeit somewhat
                    reticent about promoting their points of view directly with our Congress. They
                    rather looked to the State Department to front for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period and still concerning Japan, how well do
                        you think our policy was supported by the CIA, as far as intelligence
                        went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The CIA? I think that our policy was pretty well supported. However, there
                    is one weakness about the Agency which was disturbing to me. That is, they
                    tended to get involved in doing things which, if they ever became publicly
                    known, would have been deeply embarrassing to the United States. In other words,
                    they interfered in the Japanese electoral process. They did this in Japan and
                    they did it in the Philippines. When I became Assistant Secretary for East Asian
                    and Pacific Affairs, I saw to it that there would be no more of that. I think
                    that it is a very poor idea for the Agency ever to get involved in the internal
                    politics of foreign countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is counterproductive.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. The CIA was involved in Japan in this sense. As it turned out, there
                    was an article in the press a few months ago about this involvement. I was
                    surprised and shocked to read about it. I didn't know that there had been such
                    involvement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then why don't we move on to the next subject? Is there
                        anything else that you wanted to cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. The Soviet Union and the relationship of the communists in Japan to
                    the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union played its cards vis-a-vis Japan just about
                    as badly as it could. That was a real blessing to us. Consider that when the
                    US-Japan Security Treaty was being negotiated the communists, the socialists,
                    and a lot of the intellectuals were urging a foreign policy of neutrality for
                    Japan. But the Russians came through with threats which really made such a
                    policy impossible, quite apart from the record of Korea itself. You would have
                    thought that once the Russians saw how much success our mutual security treaty
                    had achieved in US-Japanese relations, they would have seen the wisdom of
                    turning back at least some of these islands in the northern territories of
                    Japan. This is something they have never done—even to this day. They have never
                    understood that by simply turning over these woebegone islands they could have
                    gained an opportunity for getting loans, investments, and a peace treaty with
                    Japan. They still don't have a peace treaty. The Russians acted in ways that
                    made our job easier in Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, the Kuril Islands...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, the southern Kuril Islands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our reading of why the Soviets wouldn't turn
                        these islands over to Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: That was hard to understand, because we're talking about four islands. Two
                    of them are fairly large, but all are without resources except their proximity
                    to fishing grounds, valuable to the Japanese. The Russians had more territory
                    than they could ever use. By turning back these islands to Japan they would gain
                    all kinds of opportunities...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it submarine passage or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: There were several available passages for Soviet vessels going through the
                    Japanese chain of islands. Evidently the Russians were (and still are) opposed
                    to any territorial concessions lest this constitutes a bad precedent elsewhere
                    along the borders of Russia—and it was probably an issue of special sensitivity
                    to the Soviet (now Russian) armed forces.</p>

                <p>Now we're returning to the time when you were returning from Korea in 1962, was

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. I went from Korea around Thanksgiving Day in 1961 to Hong Kong as
                    Consul General. I was Consul General there for about a year and a half when I
                    was called back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take that period. When was that? 1962?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I came back to Washington in 1963 to be Deputy Assistant Secretary,
                    basically to take a long, hard look at China policy. However, after President
                    Kennedy was assassinated [in 1963], it was clear that we couldn't get some of
                    our major proposals through our government, although we almost got
                    liberalization of travel to all countries, removing any restrictions on travel.
                    However, ARA [Bureau of American Republic Affairs], claimed that this would
                    upset their understandings with the Organization of American States. So we never
                    got that one through. Meanwhile, Vietnam was increasingly taking up everybody's
                    time.</p>
                <p>During this period from 1963 to 1965 when I was Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    State, my concerns with Japan were really quite secondary. In fact, it's rather
                    hard for me to remember some of the things that we did at that time.</p>
                <p>I remember one meeting we had at the Chiefs of Mission Conference in 1971 in
                    Baguio [Philippines], where Armin Meyer, our Ambassador to Tokyo, made a very
                    “upbeat” presentation on Japan. It certainly pictured Japan as our most
                    important partner in the world. Our Ambassador in Korea, Bill Porter, really
                    “savaged” Ambassador Meyer on that. He made a long, fairly sarcastic and
                    sometimes humorous reply to Armin Meyer, asking what the Japanese were doing for
                    us. What burdens were they carrying? What is their attitude toward the world and
                    toward Korea—which had been the object of Japanese contempt for a long time.
                    Ambassador Porter was speaking like a Korean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way, isn't there a considerable kernel of truth
                        in this? In the case of those two countries, China and Japan, haven't we had
                        something of a “love-hate” relationship? But the “love” relationship gets
                        more involved. It strikes me that we really weren't asking much of
                        Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, we weren't asking much of Japan. We could see that Japan was going to
                    be terribly important in the future. Its GNP was rising very rapidly with growth
                    rates running around 9% a year. Japan loomed as the major contributor to
                    economic development support programs for East Asia and even for Africa and
                    other parts of the world. We saw Japan in those terms.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>During these years we also developed closer contacts with the Japanese Foreign
                    Ministry. When I was Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bill Bundy [the Assistant
                    Secretary] had meetings quite often with the Japanese. That was a system which I
                    carried on later. In fact, during Bill Bundy's tenure as Assistant Secretary, I
                    was more or less the person representing the Bureau of East Asian Affairs on all
                    issues relating to Northeast Asia, because he was so involved with Vietnam and
                    Southeast Asia. I was virtually the Assistant Secretary for Northeast Asia, as
                    he was for Southeast Asia, except when he would go on a trip, I would have to
                    take over his problems, and vice versa. He and I were a very close team. We had
                    gone to school and college together and traveled to Europe together between our
                    graduation from Groton and arrival at Yale. So we knew each other very well.</p>
                <p>I would say that there was a lot of forward motion in Northeast Asia during that
                    period. The growth figures, of course, would show that. While we felt that Japan
                    could do more to help developing countries, its “rate of donations” was greatly
                    improved over what it had been earlier on. We were grateful for that.
                    Furthermore, on the diplomatic side Japan was eager to play a more active
                    economic and developmental role in all parts of the world, including in
                    Afro-Asian affairs. As I was to find out in Indonesia, Japan was able to help
                    out in these aid donor groups. Japan was “coming of age”—that's all, though it
                    had a ways to go.</p>
                <p>We had these annual meetings with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. I remember
                    attending one such meeting during this period in Williamsburg, VA. I also went
                    to Japan as the chief of our delegation to a meeting with the Japanese up in
                    Miyanoshita, near Mt. Fuji. We and our Japanese Foreign Office counterparts felt
                    that we had a common stake in the world, with the US coming to depend more and
                    more on Japan, particularly in economic terms. We also saw advantages for all
                    concerned in the United States-Japan Mutual Security Treaty, because it provided
                    a kind of protection for everybody, including, paradoxically, China and Russia.
                    So the Japan-America relationship was highly “stabilizing” in that part of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some countries you can talk to the Foreign Ministry,
                        but they just don't play any significant role in their government. There is
                        a sort of “disconnect” involved. With Japan did you find that the Foreign
                        Ministry played a strong role, as did the State Department, with some
                        exceptions, in our government regarding foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The officials of the Japanese Foreign Ministry were very important within
                    the Japanese Government because, first of all, the ministry contained many of
                    Japan's elite. They were extremely well educated. They had good foreign
                    connections, with Japan heavily dependent on other countries, both politically
                    and, of course, economically. The problems we had with Japan at that time were
                    not so much directly with Japan. They were largely subjected to third countries
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Japan was worried about our relationship with China. They were worried about our
                    relationship with Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam. They were worried that the
                    United States was going to draw Japan into “dicey” situations. When they read
                    about how our Congress and Washington in general behaved, they weren't always
                    sure that we would act sensibly in crises. If we did wrong or guessed wrong,
                    Japan would be drawn into the vortex. So these are the kinds of things that
                    bothered the Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you “allay” these concerns at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, we allayed them by consultations—real consultations. Before we did
                    anything, we made a practice of letting them know. We would try to get their
                    agreement. That's how this whole question came up of not having gained their
                    support when President Nixon went to China. This was such a major irritant in
                    our relationship, because we'd been telling the Japanese, year after year, to
                    stay with us on the Chinese representation issue. They did. They “played ball”
                    with us, though they were very anxious to trade with China. We advised them to
                    “go easy” and so forth. So we had a staying hand on their wrist. And all of a
                    sudden, without telling them, we got to Peking first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was Assistant Secretary. We'll come back to that, of course. I've been
                    jumping ahead. I was simply trying to say that the whole question of
                    consultations developed during the period we're talking about—1963 to 1965. This
                    was part of the formative period in the consultations process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were Deputy Assistant Secretary, what was your
                        feeling about President Johnson's interest in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I'm not sure whether I remember much about President Johnson's interest in
                    Japan. I don't remember his being that much concerned with Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's an answer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>GREEN: I remember talking with President Johnson about Indonesia and about how
                    important Japan was as the principal economic supporter of Indonesia. I also
                    told him that I consulted with my Japanese colleagues, whom I'd known very well.
                    This became kind of a way to “get through” to Sukarno. Sukarno's Japanese wife
                    was a close friend of the Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia, who then introduced
                    me to her. Of course, LBJ was primarily concerned with our growing involvement
                    in the wars in Indochina, and he must have become aware of the fact that any
                    heavy bombing of Asians in Southwest Asia was likely to be deeply disturbing to
                    Asians elsewhere, including Japan. The Japanese government cooperated with us in
                    not raising major obstacles to our military operations in Indochina, but they
                    did this with many reservations and considerable reluctance.</p>

                <p>GREEN: I had already had several assignments related to Japan. Japan had been a
                    thread throughout my career. During the period from 1969 to 1973 I saw Japan as
                    increasingly important on the world scene, and especially in East Asia. I saw
                    the primacy of the US-Japan security relationship in the broadest sense of the
                    word. We had a common goal. Many objectives on the world scene were shared
                    objectives. Japan had the technological and economic strength. We had a lot of
                    that but we also had the military strength. Therefore, by working in unison,
                    with each country participating to the maximum extent in accordance with its
                    special strengths, we could make quite a mark on the world in terms of peace and
                    progress. Not for any expansionist reasons but simply for improving conditions
                    of life for the people of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 1969, when you became Assistant
                        Secretary. This was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The first experience I had with Japan in 1969 right after I was appointed
                    Assistant Secretary by President Nixon, was in the course of a trip through the
                    whole of East Asia, meeting with the various national leaders, all of which I've
                    covered in the book I co-authored entitled War and Peace with China.</p>
                <p>As Assistant Secretary-designate, I visited Japan in April 1969 at the end of a
                    long trip through East Asia. My purpose was principally to convey to Japanese
                    leaders impressions of my trip and to answer questions about President Nixon's
                    views. This segment of my trip was very much like the others. In Japan my pitch
                    was that we would stand by our commitments and that we considered our security
                    treaty with Japan to be the keystone of our whole security position in that part
                    of the world, and so forth.</p>
                <p>I also mentioned a number of things about the countries of the area being in a
                    better position to “fend for themselves.” I also explained the Vietnamization
                    program, which was already under way, involving turning over more
                    responsibilities to the Vietnamese. So that was my first connection with Japan
                    during the Nixon administration, when I met the leaders.</p>
                <p>The second contact with Japan during my time as Assistant Secretary was very
                    closely related to the first one. That concerned “The Nixon Doctrine” itself.
                    You remember that “The Nixon Doctrine” originated on July 25 [1969], when the
                    President was making a trip around the world. He stopped off in Guam and had a
                    background press conference at the Top-of-the-Mar Hotel.</p>
                <p>In this press conference President Nixon expressed what became known as “The
                    Nixon Doctrine.” Well, along with Bob Barnett, I had written the “scope paper”
                    for his trip through Asia in July [1969]. In this paper I suggested that the
                    President say many of the things that I had mentioned earlier on in March and
                    April [1969] about the countries of the area being in a better position to fend
                    for themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>In his backgrounder, the President put his emphasis more on military affairs, on
                    our defense commitments, and on our progress to help strengthen the defense
                    capabilities of our friends and allies. However, it was the primary
                    responsibility of each country to provide for its own defense, to the maximum
                    extent possible. We could only provide assistance in a supplementary sense.</p>
                <p>Quite frankly, this had a lot to do with Japan, because in the scope paper that
                    Bob Barnett and I had written for the President's trip around the world we
                    emphasized the fact that these countries were “more on their feet” these days,
                    with Japan beginning to provide economic assistance, as indeed it had in
                    Indonesia, where they were giving just as much assistance as we were. Later on,
                    they gave more. My idea of “The Nixon Doctrine” tracked back, in many ways, to
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>The Japanese reaction to the Nixon Doctrine was generally favorable. They
                    formally expressed their complete support several months later, in November
                    [1969], when Prime Minister Sato gave what he called “The New Pacific Age”
                    speech, which was a distinct reflection of the Nixon Doctrine. The whole concept
                    of this speech concerned the United States working together with Japan and in
                    support of the economic development and progress of all of East Asia.</p>
                <p>The United States and Japan were further drawn together, I would say, by the
                    Nixon Doctrine and what it expressed. The reactions of some of the other
                    countries of East Asia were generally good, but they were nervous, fearing that
                    the United States was preparing a rationale for minimizing its assistance to
                    them. So I had a great deal of difficulty in reassuring the countries concerned
                    that we were not “getting out.” Once again, I talked about other countries (like
                    Japan) being in a position to do more. As economic development progressed, the
                    countries that were doing the best were in a position to help other friendly
                    nations.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, after the President gave his backgrounder to the press in Guam, he
                    said that I would be prepared to answer further questions. Well, I didn't know
                    what he had said not having been invited up to the press conference. It was a
                    little embarrassing for me because I then had to brief the press both at the
                    next stop, which was Manila, and then in Jakarta.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The press kept asking questions about what had gone on at the summit meetings
                    between Nixon and Marcos in the Philippines and Nixon and Suharto in Indonesia.
                    Since nobody in the State Department, including the Secretary of State, was
                    present at those meetings, only President Nixon, Kissinger, and the head of
                    government concerned knew what the President had said. The press people were not
                    interested in general background. They wanted to know precisely what was said.
                    All I had was a slip of paper from someone on one or two points that I could
                    make. Probably, Ron Ziegler [President Nixon's press spokesman] got this slip of
                    paper from Henry Kissinger. That was about it. It was very embarrassing for me.
                    I recall that “Newsweek” magazine came out with an article, saying that my
                    briefing in Manila was very much like a travel lecture. That was about all I
                    could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the principal person dealing with Asian affairs
                        at that time and you had largely spent your career dealing with Asian
                        matters. How did you feel about Kissinger's views on Asia at the beginning
                        of the Nixon administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I saw a good deal of Kissinger during 1969. I could sense increasingly
                    that he wanted to have nothing to do with the State Department and that he was
                    going to “run” foreign policy. I realized that I was going to be his principal
                    victim as the Assistant Secretary for East Asia and the Pacific, the area which
                    was primarily “on the block” at that time. I could see that I was going to spend
                    a lot of time dealing with an evasive White House. Another thing that bothered
                    me, since we are talking about Japan, is that the only person Kissinger had on
                    his staff who knew anything about Japan was Dick Sneider [a Foreign Service
                    Officer and later Ambassador to Korea]. Shortly after that Dick Sneider found
                    that he couldn't get along with Kissinger and was assigned to Japan. After that,
                    they had nobody on the White House staff who had real Japanese experience. The
                    Japan factor wasn't adequately considered in a series of situations that were to
                    arise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I do these interviews, there is one thing that comes
                        through. That is, first, Henry Kissinger was very “bright.” However, and
                        secondly, there were areas that he didn't know very much about and relied on
                        his “brightness.” Often, it didn't work out very well. Africa was one such
                        area. Latin America was another...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think that Kissinger had lots of gaps in his knowledge of the world. He
                    was a splendid tactician. In a given situation he knew how to maneuver very well
                    indeed. He also is very good at briefing and is highly articulate. These were
                    his strengths. However, depth of knowledge about East Asia, no. He had none. I
                    think that his failure to draw upon the expertise of people who had spent their
                    lives working on East Asia was a great mistake on his part. That is not the way
                    we should run a government. To pay these people for all of those years of work
                    and then not use them is pointless—worse than pointless.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Another problem is one that nobody ever speaks about. Let me mention it right
                    now. When you are “cut out” of things, the way other people and I were “cut out”
                    of them, and you know that you are being “cut out,” you begin to lose confidence
                    in yourself, because you know that you don't have all the threads in your hand.
                    You don't have the complete picture. Meanwhile, Kissinger knew that you didn't
                    have the complete picture, and therefore he tended to discredit your views
                    accordingly. It ended up by nobody really knowing what the other person knew or
                    didn't know. It's a very bad way of running a government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the information flow must be “up and down.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Right. He was playing his proper role of maneuvering and conducting
                    certain kinds of delicate negotiations. However, with the assistance of key
                    people in the State Department, we would not have made some of the mistakes that
                    we made. Furthermore, we would have had a strong, effective foreign policy
                    because it was headed by a man [President Nixon] who came into office, probably
                    knowing more about foreign affairs than any president in history. We had a
                    wonderful opportunity but, of course, a lot of that was not properly used. We
                    could have done much better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we keep our focus on Japan from 1969 through 1973, what
                        do you think were some of the major developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I would say that the two major developments were the opening to China and
                    the “reversion” of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan. I would also mention the Nixon
                    Doctrine and the related Vietnamization program as being a fundamental
                    development. So those were the principal developments during the Nixon
                    administration that related to Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about China. One of the great moments in the
                        Nixon administration was the opening to China after many years of isolation
                        between the United States and China, although there had been contacts.
                        You've already talked about the US and China. How about the Japan factor?
                        What were some of the points that you were concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>GREEN: The July 15, 1971 announcement by President Nixon in California of his
                    intended trip to China (following Kissinger's successful earlier trip to China)
                    produced a deep shock in Japan. This was known in Japan as the first of several
                    Nixon “shocks.” This reaction is very understandable if you bear in mind that
                    the United States and Japan had a partnership. No third country was more
                    important to the United States and Japan than China. That the President should
                    suddenly announce this surprise visit, reversing policies which we had been
                    pursuing for a long time, was deeply embarrassing to the government of Prime
                    Minister Sato. One of the things we must remember was the fact that, year after
                    year, the United States had been trying to keep communist China out of the
                    United Nations. Sentiment in Japan had been rather favorable toward the People's
                    Republic of China as being a member of the United Nations. We had kept Japan “in
                    line” on this issue. When we suddenly announced that President Nixon was going
                    to go to China, it also looked as though we were “abandoning” Taiwan, which had
                    been a Japanese territory at one time and where the Japanese had enormous
                    interests. Taiwan is very close to Japan. All of this boded ill to Japan.</p>
                <p>However, above all, this subject was what was known as “Asakai's nightmare.”
                    Asakai was the Japanese Ambassador to Washington [at the time of the Nixon
                    announcement]. His nightmare was that he would wake up one morning and find that
                    the United States was represented in Peking. All of this put Japan in a terribly
                    difficult position. It left the Japanese Government—and Prime Minister Sato in
                    particular—with a feeling that they had been worsted, that Sato himself had been
                    overshadowed by Nixon, that we were not reliable partners, and that we didn't
                    consult, when consultations are fundamental to any viable relationship. The
                    Japanese felt that we were committed to consult on all issues and hadn't done
                    so. As a result, the reaction in Japan [to the Nixon announcement] was quite
                    severe, at first. I don't think that the White House had really thought about
                    this.</p>
                <p>When Secretary of State Rogers called up on July 15, shortly after the President
                    had made his announcement on television, to ask me and Jack Irwin, the Deputy
                    Secretary of State, how we felt about the news, I said that it was “great but
                    what about Japan?” Rogers said, “Well, what about Japan?” I said, “The Japanese
                    are going to take this terribly hard.” Rogers said, “But we gave them advance
                    notice.” I said, “You gave them an hour or two advance notice, but that's not
                    much advance notice, and that's not consultations.” I said that we were going to
                    have a severe problem with Japan.</p>
                <p>At that point I said that Dick Ericson and I would draft a message of explanation
                    from the President to Prime Minister Sato and get it to the President by telex
                    immediately. So Nixon sent that message to Sato. It was an effort to try to
                    placate the Japanese. When we were in Peking, as I said in my book on the
                    subject, as well as, I think, in my oral history of the time, there were
                    indications that Peking was very concerned about the US-Japanese
                    relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leaving China to face Japan and Russia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>GREEN: They [the Chinese] didn't like that. On the other hand they suspected that
                    all this US-Japan partnership talk might have a contrary design. Maybe the
                    United States was building up Japan as a military force before it left the area,
                    so that Japan could take over China.</p>
                <p>When I was in Peking [with President Nixon], I had a number of talks with a man
                    who was very close to the Chinese Prime Minister Zhou En-lai. His name was
                    Hsiung Hsiung-hui, a special assistant to the prime minister. On three occasions
                    during the visit he took me aside—during automobile rides and once when we were
                    rowing on the lake at Hangzhou—to talk about Japan. It was clear that he and the
                    prime minister were deeply concerned about Japan. They feared that we were
                    playing our hand in such a way that Japan was going to be a new military power
                    on the world scene. China's memories of Japanese occupation were very deep and
                    rather fresh. I said, and it turned out that Henry Kissinger had said the same
                    thing when he was in Peking in the summer of 1971, that, on the contrary, our
                    whole purpose in our relationship with Japan was to ensure that Japan did not
                    have to be rearmed, except for self defense. We would provide the “Sunday
                    punch,” and Japan would not “go nuclear.” Japan would not have any expansionist
                    capabilities, because of our treaty alliance. The Chinese had never thought of
                    it that way. I added that the more lasting our security relationship with Japan
                    is, the greater the chances were that Japan would never be, or pose anything
                    like, a military threat to China. Anyway, I think that that went over well.</p>
                <p>We must remember here that Japan and China have a long, long stormy relationship,
                    particularly during the years preceding and during World War II. Therefore,
                    there are very deep-seated Chinese fears of Japan. I don't think that the White
                    House ever took them adequately into consideration. This Chinese fear of Japan
                    was more in the calculations of the State Department.</p>
                <p>The person on the State Department side who was the most knowledgeable on Japan
                    was U. Alexis Johnson, the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs.
                    Johnson's book, “The Right Hand of Power,” devotes a good deal of attention to
                    this particular issue at this particular moment. He graphically described the
                    concerns which our China policy had created in Japan. He reproved the President
                    rather strongly about our failure to consult with the Japanese properly, such as
                    by sending Alex to Japan, maybe a day or so in advance of the announcement. This
                    would have had the effect of giving Prime Minister Sato time to prepare his
                    position publicly and how he was going to express it. Secondly, for us to have
                    taken the unusual step of sending a special emissary to Japan, would be evidence
                    of the primacy we accorded Japan and the importance we attached to Japan's
                    constructive relationship with China. However, for reasons which have never been
                    explained, the administration called off plans to have Johnson make that trip
                    which left a permanent scar on US-Japan relations, according to Alex.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>In my meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Sato and Foreign Minister Fukuda
                    following Nixon's China trip, they acted like the old friends that they are.
                    Even though the press, including especially the press in the United States, was
                    talking about what a disaster this had been for US-Japanese relations, that was
                    not my impression at all. I read Selig Harrison's and other people's accounts of
                    the mood in Japan at the time I arrived. By the time I left I had the impression
                    that this view was far too pessimistic. The fact of the matter is that I got
                    along fine with both the prime minister and the foreign minister. The Embassy in
                    Tokyo later reported that what a success our visit had been in terms of allaying
                    Japanese concerns over our China policy. So I think that we got over that hump.
                    That doesn't mean that there are no residual fears.</p>
                <p>I might add one other thing here, and I'll come back to this later. I mentioned
                    the Nixon “shocks.” We had other problems with the Japanese, largely over
                    trade.</p>
                <p>At the time of the agreement with Japan on the reversion of the Ryukyu Islands in
                    November, 1969, there was an understanding that one of the things that Japan
                    would do, in response to our rather generous offer on the return of the Ryukyus,
                    was that they would respect certain “restraints” on textile [exports to the
                    United States]. President Nixon was under very heavy pressure from a number of
                    members of Congress from the South, where our textile industry had moved, to
                    “deliver” on these restraints, so that the Japanese would not export such large
                    quantities of textiles.</p>
                <p>Well, to make a long story short, from his end Prime Minister Sato was unable to
                    bring “his” textile industry along. Therefore, that understanding fell apart.
                    President Nixon was furious. This was another area where I don't think that the
                    President ever understood the Japanese leadership, as he did the Chinese
                    leadership. I'm sure that he compared Sato, Fukuda, and others rather
                    unfavorably with men like Zhou En-lai, who had a great, broad political and
                    strategic vision of the world. The Japanese leadership seemed to be narrowly
                    focused on economic issues, and the President and Henry Kissinger were not very
                    strong in that area. That was another reason why they were rather prejudiced
                    against Japan.</p>
                <p>There has always been a tendency in our Foreign Service, as, in fact, in the US
                    Government, which goes way back, for at least 100 years, for officials to be
                    either pro-Chinese or pro-Japanese. It seemed that we had fallen again into that
                    syndrome, with the President favoring China over Japan. He would never say so,
                    but that would seem to have been the case. It came largely down to personalities
                    and the fact that, as interpreters, the Chinese used attractive young ladies,
                    who would laugh uproariously when the President made a joke, before they even
                    brought themselves to interpret it, which was a clear signal to the audience
                    that they had damned well better laugh. The Japanese interpreters did their work
                    in a solemn, matter of fact voice. Interpreting Chinese is much easier than
                    interpreting Japanese—that is simultaneous interpreting. The word order in
                    Chinese sentences is similar to the word order in English, whereas Japanese word
                    order is more like German—very difficult. These are the kinds of things that
                    have added to problems in US-Japanese relations.</p>

                        period? This was a major period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We had very good people in Japan, although Ambassador Armin Meyer was not
                    a Japanese expert. He had come from being Ambassador to Iran. As a matter of
                    fact, I had been offered the job and given the choice. To make a long story
                    short, I decided to be Assistant Secretary instead. Armin had some very good
                    Japanese specialists on his staff, including Dick Sneider. So I would say that
                    it was a strong Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you felt that the reporting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The reporting was excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were speaking of Henry Kissinger and Japan. This
                        reminds me of his book, “The White House Years.” He talked about going to
                        Rome. When I read the book, I had the feeling that, in Kissinger's view, the
                        Italian Government was really just a coalition—sort of the same coalition,
                        with people “trading” government portfolios. So you couldn't get anything
                        done. Kissinger—and, I guess, President Nixon, too—were people who wanted to
                        sit down with somebody and make a deal. You can't make a deal with a
                        coalition government because there are too many people involved, who tend to
                        “water down” things. It sounds as if there was a similar process going on
                        with the Japanese. It's well known that In Japan you don't talk to somebody
                        in the Japanese Government and really reach an agreement. It takes extended
                        negotiations with both the government and within the bureaucracy to reach a
                        consensus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Absolutely. The bureaucracy in Japan is all-important. Where we have
                    political figures at the top, they have experts and bureaucrats—and these
                    include bureaucrats who specialize in foreign affairs and are very
                    knowledgeable.</p>
                <p>To be a leader, people have to know where you're going. When a US leader suddenly
                    and independently changes his course and direction—or seems to do so—it causes a
                    great deal of concern. It was our task to allay that concern. My wife's remark
                    about how wise it was for the President to send two Foreign Service Officers to
                    explain the Nixon visit to China to Far East leaders was entirely valid, since
                    John and I, were known to leaders in Asia. They knew we didn't just come in with
                    one administration and then left. We didn't have any political axes to grind. We
                    were not trying to make a career out of this matter. We were trying to do what
                    was best for the United States and for friendly countries concerned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When William Rogers was Secretary of State during this
                        period, did he have much “feel” for Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I think that Bill Rogers had a good feeling for public opinion. He would
                    have been a first rate Minister of Information, which many countries have. Of
                    course, his activities were so sharply curtailed and circumscribed by Nixon and
                    Kissinger that it's not fair to judge the man. I knew Bill Rogers very well. We
                    were very good friends and played a lot of bridge and golf together, quite apart
                    from our office contacts. I trusted him. I think that he liked the Foreign
                    Service. I felt that he could have done more in the way of taking up with the
                    President the fact that the Foreign Service strongly supported his policies. I
                    remember that I had an impassioned discussion with Rogers about this at the
                    President's poolside in San Clemente, CA. I couldn't get Bill Rogers to say more
                    than that he would take this up at the right time. I don't think that he ever
                    did.</p>
                <p>In particular, as I pointed out in War and Peace with China, the President made a
                    serious mistake not only in his unwarranted distrust of the Foreign Service but
                    also in his refusal to take Alex Johnson and me into his total confidence. As a
                    result he ran some serious risks which are mentioned in my book and one of those
                    included his unnecessarily sharp affrontal of the Japanese Government.
                    Subsequently Nixon was able to allay Japanese resentment when the President and
                    Mrs. Nixon, at my suggestion, journeyed all the way up to Alaska to greet their
                    Imperial Majesties en route to Europe by polar flight. This was the first trip
                    outside Japan by any reigning monarch of Japan; and the first foreign soil he
                    was to step on was US soil.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the rationales given out, and I tend to be very
                        dubious about rationales, which are usually developed on an “ex post facto”
                        basis, is that the White House was concerned that, if it consulted Japan on
                        any subject, the country “leaked” like mad. So the White House felt that it
                        had to be very careful. Half the reason for Nixon's problems was
                        always...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>GREEN: Nixon always put it in the sense that it would be a great blow to China if
                    the news of his trip to China should leak out. He acted as though secrecy was
                    something enjoined by China. That's not the case at all. It was his own desire
                    for secrecy that was the controlling consideration here. However, he carried
                    this penchant for secrecy to ridiculous lengths. The arrangements for the
                    President's trip to China by Kissinger had to be secret. I fully agree with
                    that. That they didn't inform the Japanese, say, a week or two weeks in advance,
                    was understandable and justifiable. It is true that the Japanese Government
                    party, the Liberal-Democratic Party, is a coalition of factions whose leaders
                    usually have to be consulted before the Prime Minister takes any action. So the
                    Prime Minister would probably have been under some obligation to “check in” with
                    the LDP factional leaders if there had been, say, more than a day or two advance
                    notice. Had we done that, probably the whole matter of the President's visit to
                    China would have leaked to the press. So, as I say, it's a question of degree. I
                    think that sending Alex Johnson to talk with Prime Minister Sato 24 hours in
                    advance would have been very helpful on that issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we talk about the reversion of Okinawa [the Ryukyu
                        Islands]? I always felt that this was one of the most difficult things to
                        handle, internally within the US Government. The US Department of Defense
                        was almost adamant about not giving Okinawa up, at least from some points of
                        view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The Department of Defense was a bit “sticky” on this issue—more than it
                    was on the US-Japan Security Treaty of 1960. Incidentally, the Security Treaty
                    of 1960 came up for renewal in 1970. So the questions that came up in 1969
                    regarding the reversion of the Ryukyus also had to take into consideration the
                    fact that, if the reversion negotiations fell through, the Security Treaty with
                    Japan might not be renewed by the Japanese. Meanwhile, there was a great deal of
                    Japanese pressure on us to “do something” about the Ryukyus.</p>
                <p>Now the issue of the reversion of the Ryukyus was very complex. First of all,
                    their strategic importance has to be underlined strongly. These are a chain of
                    islands, Okinawa being the most important one. It is located off the East China
                    Sea, right in the middle of this whole series of islands looping down from
                    southern Japan. It couldn't be more critically located. More than that, Okinawa
                    is a large island, large enough to accommodate Japanese farmers and city
                    residents, as well as a lot of American installations. We had a problem with the
                    administration there. It wasn't just like a big US military base. There was a
                    large Okinawan population to deal with. Increasingly, there was a great deal of
                    sentiment, mostly among the Okinawans, regarding their future reversion status.
                    Going back to the Peace Treaty with Japan of 1951, the Ryukyus had been placed
                    temporarily under American administration. However, their ultimate sovereignty
                    was vested in Japan. So it was simply a question of when the Ryukyus were going
                    to revert to Japanese control.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>In the State Department we thought—and certainly the Embassy in Tokyo did
                    too—that it was critically important to move rapidly on the Ryukyus. Things were
                    beginning to go “sour” in both the Ryukyus and Japan. We needed to move in a
                    timely fashion, bearing in mind that we had a deadline of 1970 [for the renewal
                    of the Security Treaty of 1960]. So we entered into talks about the reversion of
                    the Ryukyus with the Japanese in Tokyo and Washington.</p>
                <p>The big question was this. We had major bases in the Ryukyus that were of
                    critical importance in the support of any operation that we might have to
                    conduct in Southeast Asia—or China or Korea, for that matter in support of our
                    commitment. If the Ryukyus reverted to Japan, we would have to have bases in the
                    Ryukyus on a continuing basis. We would also have to have ready access to those
                    bases and the ability to use them when critically necessary. Our allies and
                    friends in embattled Southeast Asia, Korea and Taiwan were concerned over their
                    dependence on our basis in Japan, for Japan always had a tendency of being
                    rather pacifistic, and might deny us the use of those bases at a critical
                    moment. So we had to meet that concern in any communiqu� with Japan on
                    reversion.</p>
                <p>We finally got Japan to agree on language in the Joint Communiqu� (on the
                    reversion of the Ryukyus to Japan) which stated that Korea was vital to the
                    security of Japan and the United States; and that the security of Taiwan was
                    more important. Once we got agreement on that language, then things began to
                    fall pretty much into place. So we and the Japanese were able to declare in
                    November [1969], that the Ryukyus would revert to Japan in 1972. We needed the
                    time between 1969 and 1972 to complete an enormous amount of housekeeping and
                    bookkeeping duties so as to turn the administration over to Japan.</p>
                <p>As you know, the drafting of most communiqu�s always precedes agreements and
                    visits. They are not done afterwards. The communiqu� had been agreed to long
                    before Prime Minister Sato came to Washington. When Sato come to Washington,
                    there was a press conference, at which he made a statement which, in essence,
                    said that Japan recognized the critical importance of the Ryukyus to the United
                    States in discharging its security missions. Of course, it is a basic principle
                    of our Navy and of our military never to confirm or deny the presence of any
                    particular weapons systems such as nuclear. So we couldn't confirm or deny this.
                    Instead, there was an acceptable Japanese-US “understanding,” that the issue had
                    been worked out in satisfactory fashion for the Japanese.</p>
                <p>The Ryukyu issue has been discussed at some length in “The Right Hand of Power,”
                    by U. Alexis Johnson. I really don't have much to add to that. You will recall
                    that he pointed out [in the book] that there was a long, sad story of Japanese
                    inattention to the Ryukyus. There were a lot of bitter feelings in the Ryukyus
                    about the Japanese at that time—bitter feelings that Japan has subsequently been
                    at pains to allay.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Yes. The people of the Ryukyus felt like “second class citizens” and all
                    of that. So that was another issue which had to be straightened out. In other
                    words, there had to be assurances by the Japanese that they were going to treat
                    the Ryukyus “the right way.” Of course, the Japanese had a reason for giving
                    such assurances, because the international spotlight was right on them. I never
                    had any doubt that the Japanese would treat the Ryukyus properly.</p>
                <p>We had to have extended talks and discussions in Tokyo and Washington over the
                    actual reversion of the Ryukyus. The financial arrangements were “sticky,”
                    because the United States felt that we were giving up an awful lot of property
                    and we already had constructed many buildings, roads, utilities, etc. The
                    Japanese finally did come through fairly handsomely on payments to the United
                    States for materiel, buildings, and so forth which we had left to the people of
                    the Ryukyus.</p>
                <p>It was a complex negotiation, involving just about every department of our
                    government. I was the chairman of the task force in our government, dealing with
                    all of these financial and other issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you discuss your experience in dealing with the US
                        Department of Defense, at your level, on the issue of reversion of the
                        Ryukyus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, I can. I think that I may have mentioned to you, on previous
                    occasions, Stu, that I consider that the Department of Defense has come a long
                    way over the past 10 years or so, in terms of understanding diplomatic and
                    strategic issues. There isn't the kind of “gulf” separating military from State
                    Department thinking which may have existed at one time. When you were dealing
                    with Generals like Curtis Lemay, of course it was difficult. His solutions
                    started with 15 kiloton nuclear bombs and went up from there. State Department
                    solutions involve no kilotons, if we can help it. Furthermore, we have tried to
                    think in long range, political terms. I think that once we got that point
                    through to the military, they understood it very well and were strong supporters
                    of this approach. As I said, I thought that Admiral Arleigh Burke and various
                    CINCPACs were superb as “sailor statesmen.” They talked the same language that
                    we did. Setting up all these political advisers throughout the world also
                    helped. Then there are the war colleges, which have helped. The United States, I
                    think, has done more than any other country—possibly Britain has done as much, I
                    don't know, but certainly the US has done more than the countries that I have
                    dealt with—to try to instill a common understanding by civil and military
                    leaders of national goals and purposes and how to achieve them.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>We have had problems. When it comes down to dollars and cents and particular
                    issues, yes, there have been lots and lots of problems which we have had to iron
                    out. However, regarding major issues, as you “kick them upstairs,” you begin to
                    find more and more opportunities to resolve them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any other area that we should cover on Japan
                        before we move to Australia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, there is one other area that I would like to mention. I think that I
                    began to mention it during the last session that we had, Stu. That is, relations
                    between the ROK and Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ROK means the Republic of Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: The Republic of Korea and Japan. Of course, this now looms rather
                    significantly in terms of North Korea developing nuclear weapons and what
                    concerns this can create in Japan. Clearly, one of the advantages that Japan saw
                    in our security relationship was the fact that we had a military presence in
                    South Korea. In other words, we had American troops standing between Japan and
                    its potential enemies—North Korea, communist China, the Soviet Union. Throughout
                    my years as Assistant Secretary and as Deputy Assistant Secretary and Regional
                    Planning Adviser before that, I and others in State and Defense had worked very
                    hard for the retention of American forces in Korea. We still have them there
                    today. The reason we have them there today has as much to do with Japan as with
                    South Korea. If we didn't have those forces there, the Japanese would be far
                    more concerned and worried about whether they were putting their necks out too
                    far by being allied with the United States.</p>
                <p>There has also been the long-standing problem of feuding in Japan among the
                    750,000 Koreans residing there, with sharp lines drawn between those supporting
                    North Korea and those supporting South Korea. Obviously the pro-North Korean
                    crowd gave Japan the most concern because of their links with the communists in
                    Asia as well as with disappointed youth in Japan. And of course, all Koreans
                    whether in Japan or Korea harbored long memories of harsh Japanese rule in Korea
                    earlier in the century.</p>
                <p>US policy in this situation has been to urge the fair treatment of all Koreans in
                    Japan and the development of much closer relations between Japan and South
                    Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>In 1972 we heard the news that the North Koreans had made an overture to the
                    South Koreans, suggesting talks leading to the reunification of Korea.
                    Obviously, this idea was one which we welcomed, although we greatly distrusted
                    North Korea's motives. Sure enough, the North Koreans were making a “grandstand
                    play.” They wanted to go for some kind of political union [between the two
                    Korea's], or something like that. They were asking for those things which they
                    knew the South couldn't give. They also knew that the South had a lot of
                    students who, for a long time, have been very anxious to have relations with
                    North Korea. There were a lot of people in South Korea who wanted to visit their
                    friends and relatives in North Korea.</p>
                <p>The positions of South Korea, the United States, and Japan had always been,
                    “Let's work toward eventual reunification. Let's have more exchanges. Let's
                    develop a degree of mutual trust that will then enable us to move into the
                    political realm.” The very fact that the North Koreans wanted to move
                    immediately into the political realm indicated quite clearly that they were
                    trying to upset South Korea. What we knew—although we didn't say this—was that
                    the North Koreans were basically trying to get the South Koreans to agree to
                    reunification under terms which provided that the United States would withdraw
                    its forces from South Korea. We knew that this would be anathema to the
                    Japanese, as well as to ourselves and to the South Koreans. And maybe even to
                    the Chinese, by the way.</p>
                <p>So we had to play this game very delicately. In 1972 I made a trip to South
                    Korea. I had talks with President Park Chung Hee, as well as with Kim Chong Pil,
                    the Prime Minister, Kim Yong Shik, the Foreign Minister, and Lee Hu Rak, the
                    head of their CIA who was in contact with North Korea about these matters. We
                    went into some detail about them. I found that the South Koreans' thinking was
                    about the same as ours. When I went to Japan I reassured the Japanese about the
                    talks I had had in South Korea. So I was able to help calm down what could have
                    been a rather dangerous situation—at least, politically dangerous.</p>
                <p>I mention that because, as it turned out, Japan and South Korea did develop good
                    trading relationships. In essence, what happened was that Japan's success in
                    moving away from labor intensive industries into the high tech field meant that
                    Japan's labor intensive industrial field was left for other Asians to occupy.
                    The South Koreans then moved into shipbuilding and textiles. Eventually, they
                    moved out of that, and those activities shifted on to other countries, such as
                    Indonesia, for example. This was the beginning of a train of events where the
                    Japanese were able to help the South Koreans, and the South Koreans, in turn,
                    were able to help other countries. This was all part of the regional
                    interdependence that we were hoping to encourage.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>There is one other major development in 1972 relating to Japan. That is, that
                    Japan normalized its relations with China in September, 1972. Preceding that in
                    June we had a meeting with the Japanese in Hawaii. President Nixon, Kissinger,
                    Secretary of State Rogers, Alex Johnson, and I flew out in the President's plane
                    to the Kuilima Hotel, which is on the other side of Oahu from Waikiki Beach.
                    There we had a two-day conference with the Japanese, led by the new Japanese
                    Prime Minister Tanaka.</p>
                <p>I remember that on the plane going out to Honolulu, Alex Johnson, Rogers,
                    Kissinger, and I were quite concerned that, since it was known that Japanese
                    Prime Minister Tanaka was going to go to Peking to normalize relations, the
                    Japanese were in a rather weak bargaining position. Tanaka had to deliver on his
                    promise to the Japanese people that he would normalize relations with China
                    during his trip to Peking in September, 1972. This was a situation the Chinese
                    could exploit. We knew little about Tanaka. He hadn't had any advanced education
                    and was a newcomer in the international field. We were rather concerned that
                    China would come up with terms and demands which were going to make it very
                    difficult for Taiwan and the United States. It could be rather shattering for
                    our relationship with Japan if Japan were to accede to such demands.</p>
                <p>These matters were discussed on the plane going out to Hawaii. It was really
                    quite interesting, because I remember that President Nixon seemed less concerned
                    about Tanaka's trip to China than did the rest of us. He was right. Those were
                    not problems, as it turned out.</p>
                <p>When Prime Minister Tanaka went to Peking a couple of months later to normalize
                    relations, the Chinese were very considerate and reasonable. No demands were
                    made of the Japanese to terminate any of their commercial and cultural ties with
                    Taiwan, for example, with respect to airlines, sea routes, telecommunications of
                    any kind, or cultural contacts. All that China demanded was that there should be
                    a Japanese Embassy in Peking and not in Taipei. So the Japanese actually did get
                    to normalize relations with the People's Republic of China before we did. During
                    the normalization process Peking made it very clear that it welcomed good
                    relations with Japan, good relations with the United States, and good relations
                    between the United States and Japan. Here we had three countries, all of whom
                    had been at war with each other at some point during the previous half century
                    now at peace, representing the world's most powerful country (the US), the
                    world's most populous country (China) and the world's most economically dynamic
                    nation (Japan).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you were the “regional man” in the
                        State Department. You were looking for good relations between the various
                        countries. Now I'm looking at this matter almost from the Foreign Service
                        point of view. At Chiefs of Mission meetings, did you find the usual
                        parochialism, localitis, or what have you from the various ambassadors or
                        their deputies? Did you have to urge them to play a more cooperative
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>GREEN: No. The only flare up I recall between two of our members where
                    parochialism was involved, occurred at our Chiefs of Mission meeting near Manila
                    in 1971. I have already given you an account of this memorable exchange between
                    our Ambassadors to Korea (Bill Porter) and to Japan (Armin Meyer).</p>
                <p>Our Ambassadors are our officials generally, whether in Washington or the field,
                    reflected an awareness of US overall interests and were not given to
                    parochialism, for it was and is basic to US policy that our friends and allies
                    harmonize their relationships as far as possible. Much of our efforts have been
                    directed towards furthering that goal.</p>
                <p>Here I should add that our Chiefs of Mission conferences, usually annual affairs
                    in pleasant places like Baguio (the Philippines), Hong Kong or Tokyo, were also
                    attended by representatives of the Defense Department (CINCPAC), AID (Agency for
                    International Development), USIS and a few other agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the subject of Japan, I wonder if you
                        could comment on how you felt that Japan operated in the rest of the world.
                        It has become a very important country economically. The Japanese don't seem
                        to have the “clout” or influence that the United States has. In a way, it
                        doesn't seem that Japan will move in that direction outside of the field of
                        economics. Do you have any views on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: As far as military affairs are concerned, Japan is bound by its
                    constitution. More than that, it is bound by its own fears of involvement in a
                    war. The effects of World War II were traumatic, as far as the Japanese were
                    concerned. In my opinion, the chances of their going “militaristic” are very
                    low, indeed. They are all the more reliant on the United States, because their
                    whole position in the world is based upon commerce—access to raw materials and
                    markets. The United States is the best guarantor of that—far better than the
                    United Nations itself. And the Japanese know that. It is a fundamental “plus” in
                    our relationship as long as we are a reliable ally, standing firm against
                    threats to Japan and the US, such as are now implicit in the potential
                    development of nuclear war capabilities by North Korea.</p>
                <p>Now I will not get into US-Japan trade issues, but it must be emphasized that in
                    the realms of trade, economics, technology and science, the Japanese are fully
                    as powerful as the US. Its role in third world development assistance is highly
                    laudable.</p>
                <p>Where Japan is weak and, in terms of its size and power, too ineffectual on the
                    world scene relative to its failure to be adequately involved in global
                    strategies, political and social issues.</p>
                <p>Finally, let me emphasize the supervening importance of the US-Japanese
                    relationship in the years ahead—and the consequent need for greater American
                    understanding of the Japanese people and their culture.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In our relations with Japan, we have discovered that it is very hard for the
                    Japanese to make up their minds, very hard for them to reach a consensus. They
                    are consensus builders. We're not. We can have Republicans come to town and,
                    overnight, we have new US programs and policies. It's all too fast. But in Japan
                    such things take a long, long time. So that if we're looking for quick answers
                    and quick results, as we often do as a world leader—we try to “sign people
                    up”—we find the Japanese lagging behind. Because of their political processes,
                    they operate that way. Almost all democratic countries do that—much more than we
                    do. So it takes some time for Japan to make up its mind. And sometimes we get
                    impatient. That's one difficulty.</p>
                <p>Another difficulty, of course, is in the whole field of trade and the way their
                    system works. The Japanese are far better organized than we are. They save a
                    great deal more than we do. A lot of the things that we do badly, they do well,
                    and vice versa. I've often thought that the best solution for Japan and the
                    United States is for each to be more like the other. Americans could save more
                    and plan further ahead, the way the Japanese do, to place greater emphasis on
                    education and family unity, more circumspect, more cautious, and certainly to
                    think more in terms of the interests of society, rather than just those of the
                    individual. We would do better if we did that.</p>
                <p>For their part the Japanese would do better if they thought more in terms of
                    other races, the need to harmonize with other peoples of different backgrounds,
                    to relax and enjoy life more, spending more on housing, infrastructure and the
                    good things in life. Also if they strove to play a more constructive role across
                    a wider range of the world agenda. These are the things that the Japanese should
                    do.</p>
                <p>I believe the Japanese have always rather envied the United States for its wide
                    open spaces and its free spirit. We have to remember that Japan has always lived
                    on a few, rocky islands off the shores of Asia—far away from the rest of the
                    world with which it has commercial links. Its whole history, its topography, its
                    geography, its outlook are different. So we are “the odd couple” which simply
                    has to get along.</p>
                <p>The most important long-term investment we can make toward improving US-Japanese
                    understanding is for Americans to know a lot more about the Japanese, their
                    language and culture than we do today.</p>

                <p>I accordingly inaugurated in 1988, with the help of my wife, the Marshall Green
                    Fund, managed by the Japan-American Society of Washington, DC of which I was
                    President at that time. This Fund supports programs encouraging the study of
                    Japanese language and of Japanese area studies deeply at the high school level.
                    Originally the program operated only in the Washington area; now it is
                    nationwide, providing incentive awards to students and teachers as well as
                    videotapes, Japanese encyclopedias and dictionaries. The Fund also finances with
                    the help of Mobil Corp. an annual “Japan Bowl” competition among high schools in
                    terms of language proficiency and general knowledge about Japanese policies,
                    history and culture. Nineteen teams competed in the Japan Bowl” in 1995 held at
                    the George Mason University.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, shall we turn to Australia for a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I wasn't prepared to talk about Australia, but I will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Australia [as Ambassador] from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I was there from 1973 to 1975—the middle of 1973 to the middle of 1975.
                    About two years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain how you got that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It was one of those assignments—and about the only one that I got—which I
                    worked out for myself. I was Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific
                    Affairs at the time and was more or less in a position to get the next job that
                    I wanted. There were two countries that were “open” in our area for Ambassadors;
                    the Philippines or Australia. Bill Sullivan, my deputy, had been head of the
                    Vietnam task force, and was very close to Henry Kissinger. He had traveled with
                    him, particularly during those frenetic moments before the Paris Peace
                    Conference, in January, 1973. So Bill Sullivan enjoyed great “clout” over at the
                    White House. He could get pretty much what he wanted.</p>
                <p>Since I was his superior, and since both of us were looking for new jobs well
                    removed from the war in Indochina, I said, “Bill, you see a lot of Henry
                    Kissinger on your trips down there [to Key Biscayne, Florida, to meet with
                    President Nixon]. You and I have been in this job for four years now, and it's
                    time we got out. I know there are two key jobs now about to open in the bureau,
                    Australia and the Philippines. I also know that you want Australia. Well, so do
                    I and I'm older and I'm your senior. So please feel free to accept the
                    Philippines.” So on one of his trips down to Florida, they really settled this
                    matter. Of course, they had to talk to the President. I think that the President
                    was only too glad to have me go to Australia.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Now, the reason why he was glad to have me go to Australia was not so much that
                    Australia was a wonderful place. I've liked the Australians and always have. It
                    had nothing to do with that. It had to do with the fact that our relations with
                    Australia suddenly had plummeted when the Australian Labor Party [the ALP] came
                    into power after being in the opposition for about 23 years. During all of those
                    years, when the ALP was out of power and when the Liberal Party, in coalition
                    with the Country Party—more or less the “conservatives”—ran the government, the
                    Liberal-Country government campaigned on the basis of its close ties with the
                    United States. In other words, they claimed, “We are the parties that have the
                    friendship of the United States.” One of the campaign slogans of the
                    Liberal-Country coalition had been, “All the way with LBJ”—that is, with
                    President Johnson. LBJ loved Australia. He always thought that Australia was the
                    next, rectangular state West of El Paso and treated it that way.</p>
                <p>In late 1972 there was a change in the government, and Labor came to power for
                    the first time in more than 20 years. Labor was influential in getting Australia
                    out of the war in Vietnam, which, I think, President Nixon took amiss. The idea
                    that our great, staunch ally suddenly had “opted out” of the war, largely due to
                    the influence of the Labor Party, which was now the governing party, [was less
                    than agreeable to the President]. When the Labor Party came to power, some of
                    its ministers began to make some very nasty statements about American foreign
                    policy, Vietnam, and all the rest of it. There were the same anti-Vietnam
                    feelings in Australia that we had in our country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a relationship between their Labor Party and
                        the left wing of the Labour Party in Great Britain? They had some of the
                        same “class attitudes” and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: There was a “left” and a “right” in the Australian Labor Party. There were
                    some left wingers, but there were also people whose views were politically
                    almost the same as those of the outgoing, Liberal Party.</p>
                <p>What we didn't know in Washington was that some of the statements that were being
                    made by Labor cabinet ministers, which were outrageous, were not officially
                    endorsed by the government as such. Cabinet ministers of the Australian Labor
                    Party—this was not true of cabinet ministers of the Liberal and Country
                    Parties—were considered to be speaking officially only when discussing matters
                    within their own portfolios. So the statements by ministers like Cairns, Connor
                    and Cameron criticizing the US, Nixon and our policies in Vietnam were
                    “non-official” and not to be taken seriously by the US. But we took it as an
                    official expression of what the government felt. I should have known better, but
                    we in Washington were uninformed on that point since it had never come up
                    before, Labor being out of power for so long.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The White House was absolutely incensed. Nixon then left instructions that nobody
                    at the rank of Assistant Secretary or above could speak to any Australian
                    officials in Washington or elsewhere. This made it very difficult for me because
                    one of my closest friends was Jim Plimsoll, who was the Australian Ambassador to
                    Washington and later was the Australian Ambassador to Moscow. He was also a real
                    authority on the United Nations. We consulted with him quite a bit on the
                    “Chirep” issue, as we called the Chinese representation question. He was
                    enormously helpful. The idea of cutting off communications was foolish. I went
                    to Secretary of State Rogers and said, “Mr. Secretary, I cannot do this.” He
                    said, “Well, you do just what you think you have to do. I don't think there will
                    be any problems.” So I had meetings with Jim at his house, where we talked over
                    things. I kept him apprized, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you let him know about this unhappiness [in the White
                        House]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, of course. He knew all about it. By the way, Ambassador Plimsoll told
                    me that in Australia they also had problems around the beginning of the year.
                    That's their summer. He said, “That's our silly season. People make all kinds of
                    asinine remarks.” He said, “Your silly season is the reverse of ours,” occurring
                    during August when everyone's off on vacation, physically and mentally.</p>
                <p>True enough. The beginning of the year is the serious season in Washington. There
                    is the State of the Union speech, the economic message of the President, and all
                    that. Here were Australian cabinet ministers coming in with irresponsible
                    remarks. Nixon was absolutely furious.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, Nixon called me up and asked me to be Ambassador to Australia. He said,
                    “Normally, Marshall, I wouldn't send you to a place like Australia, but right
                    now it is critically important. I think that you're the man for it.” I said,
                    “Thank you, Mr. President. I will do my very best. I really welcome this
                    assignment.” So I got it despite all of the nasty things Nixon had said behind
                    my back—and he “fired” me a couple of times. Basically we always maintained a
                    friendship that lasted right through to his death. When I was about to go to
                    Australia, I happened to be walking with the President from a White House
                    luncheon toward his oval office. President Nixon suddenly expostulated:
                    “Marshall, I can't stand that....” And he used some expletives to describe Prime
                    Minister Whitlam, which was a strange kind of parting instruction to get from
                    your President.</p>
                <p>So I arrived in Australia against this background. Meanwhile, the Australian
                    trade unions had declared a boycott on handling any American vessels coming to
                    Australia. Acting on his own Teddy Gleason slapped a counter-boycott against
                    loading or unloading any Australian vessels in American east coast ports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ted Gleason is the president of the International
                        Longshoremen's Union in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, on the East coast. Since Australian exports to the United States were
                    mostly perishable cargo—we are talking about meat, dairy products, and things
                    like that—non-servicing Australian vessels was a far more serious situation.
                    Anyway, that eventually brought the Australians back to their senses.</p>
                <p>So, when I arrived in Australia, it was against all of this background. But the
                    very fact that I had been an Assistant Secretary of State and a career man,
                    going to Australia, was regarded by Prime Minister Whitlam as such a feather in
                    his cap that he played it for all it was worth. There were statements that came
                    out in the press that at last America realized that Australia was important and
                    that, at last, Australia has a career man as American Ambassador. I was the
                    first career man assigned as Ambassador to Australia in a long, long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, you were a career man coming from the top position
                        in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: So Whitlam played this up for all it was worth. The first press conference
                    I had was a very difficult one because the issue [of Whitlam's proposed visit to
                    the US] had risen in the press. Prime Minister Whitlam was going to go to
                    England to a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers by way of Washington. He
                    wanted to pay a call on the President. So I relayed his wishes to Washington and
                    got an answer, “Hell, no.” I sent a telegram back and said that the refusal of
                    the President to receive Prime Minister Whitlam would be a very serious blow to
                    Australia-American relations.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I got in touch with opposition leaders, who had been good friends of
                    the United States for all of these years. I asked them for their views on the
                    matter of Whitlam's reception in Washington. Some of them communicated their
                    views without my asking for them. I know that Billy Snedden [Liberal Party
                    leader] and other opposition leaders at that time came in loud and strong that
                    if President Nixon refused to meet the Prime Minister of Australia, that would
                    be considered such an insult to all Australians that they—the
                    conservatives—would suffer more than the Australian Labor Party because the
                    conservatives were known to be our friends. I got that message to Washington,
                    resulting in a decision that Whitlam be received.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Whitlam did go to Washington. I went back to the US with him. I saw Henry
                    Kissinger beforehand. We talked about some of the practical issues that had come
                    up. I said that I hoped that the President would be his usual, gracious self.
                    Kissinger said, “Don't worry, the President will handle it just fine.” So
                    Whitlam had a good meeting with President Nixon. There were a lot of trade
                    issues that we had to discuss. At the end of the meeting I accompanied Whitlam
                    and Nixon down to the South Portico of the White House and saw him off in his
                    car. As we were standing there, waving Whitlam off, Nixon turned to me and said,
                    “You know, he's quite a guy,” which is as close as the President came to paying
                    him a compliment. So that bad beginning happened to have a good end.</p>
                <p>During my time in Australia I guess that my principal task was one of trying to
                    redefine our relationship, which had been too much a dominant US relationship,
                    with the United States telling Australia what to do. The whole question of
                    consultation was involved. And by consultation I did not mean merely advance
                    notice but really consulting. This became a really important issue. We failed on
                    occasion to do it, and it caused a real blowup in Australia. For example, we
                    announced our intention to develop a submarine base in the middle of the Indian
                    Ocean and didn't give Australia advance notice. This is the kind of thing they
                    flared up about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to the defense facility at Diego
                        Garcia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. By the way, there was an interesting story about Diego Garcia. We got
                    a circular telegram to all of our posts in the Indian Ocean littoral, asking
                    them to report on how the respective host governments felt about our base at
                    Diego Garcia. I saw Prime Minister Whitlam on frequent occasions. He was a very
                    close friend. He told me how Australia felt about it, and his reaction was
                    generally upbeat; and we got copies of telegrams to Washington from Ambassador
                    Moynihan in India, and from other American Embassies. There was a one-line
                    telegram from Dave Osborn, who was our Ambassador to Burma. He said, “As far as
                    the Burmese are concerned, Diego Garcia is just another damned Cuban cigar.”
                    That was probably the most accurate of all of the mission reports to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Quite apart from the usual trade problems, we had some difficulties regarding our
                    bases in Australia. We had these highly secret “facilities,” especially West of
                    Alice Springs [Northern Territory] and Nurunga [South Australia], and also at
                    Northwest Cape [West Australia], where we had a naval facility, basically a
                    communications center for our submarines in that part of the world. It
                    transmitted signals underwater for long distances [Extremely Low
                    Frequency—ELF—messages]. The use of our other bases and what our bases were
                    doing were always difficult questions to handle, because we have not stated
                    publicly, even to this day, the precise functions of the facilities we had at
                    Alice Springs and Nurunga. That was one problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The other problem was that earlier we allowed American Congressmen to visit these
                    bases but didn't let Australian Parliamentarians do so. By the time I arrived in
                    Australia, Dick Sneider, who had meanwhile moved back to Washington to be Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, was enormously helpful to me. He had been my deputy in
                    Washington. He helped to work out arrangements with the Australians regarding
                    Congressional and Parliamentary visits. In other words, we allowed members of
                    Parliament and of Congress to visit the facilities at Alice Springs and Nurunga.
                    We didn't tell them all about it. They saw the facilities, but they didn't know
                    everything about these highly classified bases.</p>
                <p>The top leaders in Australia were privy to the mission of these facilities. Prime
                    Minister Whitlam knew about them. However, I don't think that Whitlam ever fully
                    understood, until near the end of my stay in Australia, why these facilities
                    were so important for world peace. When he did understand this, he turned around
                    from being more or less a “reluctant” ally to being an “enthusiastic” ally on
                    this operation.</p>
                <p>We worked these problems out. We had some difficulties because Whitlam's deputy
                    [Jim Cairns] was one of the people who had been critical about our base
                    facilities. The question arose of whether he would be informed. Normally,
                    because of his job, he would be. However, it turned out that he didn't want to
                    be informed. So that solved that problem.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of issues that related to things of this nature. By and large, it
                    was a question of redefining our relationship. I gave many speeches in
                    Australia, all over the place. We had our own aircraft available which belonged
                    to CINCPAC and was used by CINCPAC for ferrying personnel and members of our
                    otherwise inaccessible bases in Central Australia and the Northwest Cape. But
                    when the sizeable Convair Metropolitan was not in use by CINCPAC, it was made
                    available to me, and I used it often to get all around Australia as well as to
                    make trips to remote areas in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Nauru to
                    which I was also accredited. The plane also enabled me to accept countless
                    speaking engagements in many towns and cities of Australia. A typical such
                    engagement involved arrival at noon for a city hall reception, followed by an
                    afternoon of golf in which my plane pilot colonel and I challenged the local
                    talent, followed by a gala dinner and speech and then spending the night at the
                    home of an Australian friend in that area. Anyway, I gave many speeches—close to
                    a hundred—and made many friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was good for your golf game, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: It did a lot for my golf game. The Australians love golf. They have 69
                    golf courses within 30 miles of the center of Canberra, to show you how
                    culturally advanced they are. So I had a great time in Australia and I think
                    that we successfully redefined our relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>As I had frequent occasion to say: the US and Australia, though enjoying many
                    ties of friendship and common interests in world affairs, still retain their
                    independent roles in the world. Neither of us should look for a locked-step
                    relationship, for such a rigid relationship could only snap in the winds of
                    controversy. Today our relationship must be both friendly and flexible, based on
                    common values, and quite frequent consultations, and true equality.</p>
                <p>May I just say one other thing about Australia, because it is something that most
                    people probably don't realize. That is, the importance of the Battle of the
                    Coral Sea. The Coral Sea victory...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was back in May, 1942.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: May, 1942. This was a critical moment in Australian history. You must
                    remember that Australia has never been invaded and has never had a revolution or
                    civil war. The only time that they nearly were attacked and occupied was when
                    the Japanese were poised to occupy Australia [in 1942], and the Battle of the
                    Coral Sea turned this around. This had a tremendous impact on Australia. So they
                    had a Coral Sea Week. When I was there, a well-known American like Defense
                    Secretary Cap Weinberger and Mrs. Weinberger would come down and spend a week
                    going around Australia. These sentimental contacts were all-important in our
                    relationship, contributing to the depth and warmth. The fact that Australia
                    hadn't had the revolutionary and civil war experiences which we have had as a
                    nation left them a bit more vulnerable to tides of opinion.</p>
                <p>I think that the American relationship was always very central in Australia, and
                    that I left it that way. I might say, though, that the left wing of the
                    Australian Labor Party did give me some problems. There was one man in
                    particular, Senator William Brown, from the State of Victoria, who charged that
                    I was the principal CIA agent in the Western Pacific and that I was in Australia
                    to “undermine” the country, and so forth. These charges attracted a good deal of
                    prominence. Prime Minister Whitlam, of course, rejected them. Then Senator Brown
                    said that on July 4, [1974], he was going to say all that he knew about this. He
                    had a big meeting in Melbourne, Victoria. Thousands of people jammed the
                    streets. He climbed to the podium and then said nothing that he hadn't said
                    before. People just turned away and said, “This guy is a crumb.” I was very high
                    profile when I was in Australia and was very much at the center of press
                    attention, because of the fact that we had sent...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we had sent, not necessarily political “hacks,”
                        but they had been friends of the President. Australia was regarded as a nice
                        place to send “political people.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>GREEN: On one occasion I went back to the US on leave and found that the
                    Australian Ambassador to the United States, whose name was Snow, had been in
                    Washington for six months and hadn't called on Kissinger. I went to Henry and
                    said, “You've got to receive the Australian Ambassador. After all, Prime
                    Minister Whitlam receives me all the time.” Henry said, “Well, if you say so,
                    Marshall, I will.” So I set up a meeting and was sitting in Kissinger's outer
                    office with the Australian Ambassador, waiting to go in. Ambassador Snow said,
                    “You know, I've been asked by my government to invite the President or Henry
                    Kissinger or both to visit our country. We've had no visits from the President
                    for some time. We used to have them all the time. People are beginning to
                    wonder. So if I invite the President or Henry Kissinger, what do you think his
                    reply will be?” I said, “As far as Henry is concerned, he'll probably say that
                    if he has any business in Antarctica, he'll be glad to stop off in Australia on
                    his way down there or coming back.” Well, damn it, that was exactly what Henry
                    said when Ambassador Snow invited him to visit Australia. I told Henry this as
                    the minister left the room. Henry then said to me, “Go down and turn that man
                    off. He's going to report this.” So I rushed down and caught Ambassador Snow's
                    limousine by the handle, just as he was leaving. I said, “Look, Henry was just
                    being amusing. Of course, he's honored to be invited,” and so forth. But Henry
                    never went to Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, shall we stop at this point? Do you think that you
                        have left anything out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unless there is something else. You can always add, you
                        know, to your remarks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Well, there are so many things about Australia that I would like to say.
                    Let's leave it at that. The main things I've said just now. My stay in Australia
                    was a period of redefining our relationship.</p>
