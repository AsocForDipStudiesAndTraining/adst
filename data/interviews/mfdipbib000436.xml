                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going to ask Hank to lead off by simply giving a short
                        biographical sketch of his background and education. Then if you have
                        something to say about your war experiences, even though they're not
                        directly related to USIA, it will be interesting. And finally, what it was
                        that brought you into the US Information Agency</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Biosketch</p>
                <p>GOSHO: I was born in Seattle, Washington, on February 4, 1921. I went as far as
                    the fifth grade in grade school in Seattle. My father, a pharmacist, had his own
                    drugstore in Seattle; we were a family of three boys and one girl, but he had a
                    dream of starting a US-Japan pharmaceutical import-export company. He had the
                    foresight to see that the boys should learn Japanese in order to make his
                    project a success. So he sent all three of us to Japan to be educated. I
                    finished grade school, high school and two years of college in Japan.</p>
                <p>I was in my second year of college when my father, in early 1941, decided that
                    things were getting a little dicey between our two countries, and so he thought
                    that one of the three boys ought to come back. My older brother was doing well
                    in a chemical engineering course at Waseda University; my younger brother was
                    enrolled in a medical college in Okayama. I was enrolled in an international
                    relations course at a Methodist Christian school called Dwansei Gakuin. My
                    father didn't know about my school but he thought that the other two probably
                    had a better academic chance, so he asked that I come back. As it turned out, I
                    came back on the last boat, which was in September of 1941. Then three months
                    later, the war broke out. I later learned that my older brother was drafted into
                    the Japanese Navy, and my younger brother was an intern in the Japanese Army
                    Medical Corps.</p>
                <p>As you know, subsequently all Japanese, including aliens and American citizens,
                    were evacuated from the West Coast. I was interned first at Puyallup,
                    Washington, and then moved to Twin Falls, Idaho. It was called the Minidoka
                    Relocation Center.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Before that, however, I tried to enlist in the Army, but failed that. The Navy
                    wouldn't take Japanese-Americans. Of course, we didn't have an Air Force in
                    those days. But soon after the war broke out, all Japanese were declared by the
                    Selective Service as 4C, which I learned was a classification for undesirable
                    personnel or enemy aliens. Well, the only reason I bring this up is that while
                    we were interned, the War Department in Washington discovered that in this war
                    against Japan, they needed Japanese linguists for Army intelligence. So they
                    came out to these internment camps.</p>
                <p>Military Service with Merrill's Maraudersin Burma</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, I was asked if I would be interested in serving in
                    the Army intelligence. I pointed out that, “I'd be willing to do so, but I have
                    a Selective Service draft rating of 4C, which means undesirable or enemy alien.
                    What are you going to do about that?” (Laughs)</p>
                <p>The War Department found the solution by indicating that “if you volunteer, why,
                    then it's okay!!”</p>
                <p>All this is related to my getting into USIA, because I volunteered for combat
                    duty in Burma with Merrill's Marauders, at which time I met John Emmerson, a
                    Foreign Service officer, who was assigned to General Stilwell's headquarters as
                    the political advisor. When John Emmerson left the area in 1944, he said to me,
                    “If you're ever in Washington, look me up, and maybe we can get you into the
                    Foreign Service if you're interested.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I'm interested,” even though I knew that at the time, the State
                    Department did not employ Japanese-Americans.</p>
                <p>1946: Post-War - Enters State Department 1960: Transfers to VOA</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, maybe this war will change all that. But if you're ever in
                    Washington, look me up.” And I did. And he endorsed my application to the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to the Japan desk of what was called the Foreign Activity
                    Correlation Division, called FC. I was there from 1946 through the beginning of
                    1950. In those days, the Voice of America was under the State DepartmentIn 1950,
                    it was decided that they would start a Japanese language program, and they
                    decided that I should be detailed to New York to help set up and oversee the
                    Japanese program. Sax Bradford was then the chief of FC, and Herman Barger was
                    the deputy.</p>
                <p>Process of Getting into USIA</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I was in New York, and it soon became evident after several testings of those
                    Japanese living in the US, that announcing Japanese was a professional job, and
                    you needed someone who knew professional radio broadcasting. So I was sent to
                    Japan to recruit announcers from NHK. Sax Bradford, when I arrived in Japan, was
                    the PAO. Olcott Deming was the deputy. They asked if I'd be interested in coming
                    to Tokyo as a FSSO. We were then a part of the diplomatic section under GHQ
                    SCAP, and Sax was the head of the information unit. George Atkinson was
                    designated what we would now call the ambassador. Then he died in a plane crash,
                    and then William Sebald took over.</p>
                <p>I was interviewed by William Sebald, Director of the Diplomatic Section, who
                    said, “I understand you fought against the Japanese during the war.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, yes, I did. That's right.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, that may present a problem, because we submit all the names to
                    the Foreign Office, and if they find out that you were involved in the war
                    against them, they may turn you down.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, if that happens, that's what happens.” But Sax Bradford and John
                    Emmerson went to work on it, as did Olcott Deming, and eventually the State
                    Department agreed to process my “papers.”</p>
                <p>So they submitted my name. The Foreign Office approved, and so I was getting
                    ready to be transferred to Tokyo from New York, when they discovered that
                    Jeanne, my wife, was born in Japan and was an alien. (Laughs) There was no way
                    that you could get citizenship at that time. This was 1951. It wasn't until 1954
                    that the Walter McCarran — I've forgotten the other part — Act passed and State
                    immediately processed her papers. But before that, I was assigned to Tokyo on a
                    six-month basis.</p>
                <p>I guess it was during that era, when the peace treaty was signed, the diplomatic
                    section was abolished, MacArthur vacated the residence and the chancery, as we
                    knew it, and we became USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can give you a little background there. When I first
                        joined it, it was USIE, which meant the US Information and Education
                        Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shortly thereafter, they decided it wasn't being handled
                        too well, so they got a fellow by the name of Charlie Hulten to come in. He
                        was to be the General Manager. He was still to operate under the Assistant
                        Secretary of State for Public Affairs, but they changed the name to the
                        International Information Administration under State Department, and it
                        became IIA. Charlie Hulten took over as General Manager, and I think at that
                        time Ed Barrett came in as the Assistant Secretary of State for Public
                        Affairs. That was the way it stood when Eisenhower was elected. Then, of
                        course, on August 1, 1953, he issued the famous Executive Order that made
                        USIA separate from the Department of State. So that was the genesis of USIA.
                        However, as soon as we got out from under the SCAP, we became USIS in Japan.
                        All through these other permutations of naming, we remained USIS and are
                        still USIS today, except for that one 4-year interlude when they made
                        everybody USICA a few years ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Then we became USIA in 1953. Then we became FSIOs. Up until that time, we
                    were all FSSs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, FSSs or FSRs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Gosho Regularly Assigned to USIS Tokyo, 1954</p>
                <p>GOSHO: Right. My first job, while we were still FSSs, with USIS was as Radio
                    Officer, primarily because I was with VOA. Just about that time, the commercial
                    radio started out in Japan. Up until that time, everything was run by NHK, the
                    quasi-government radio organization. Nobody thought that commercial radio would
                    ever catch on in Japan, but Radio Tokyo, which started out, came to USIS and
                    asked for assistance. Victor Hauge was then the chief of the radio branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember exactly what date it was that you arrived
                        in Tokyo? I had come out a short time before you arrived, and I can't
                        remember just when it was you came. When you came to be actually assigned to
                        USIS or its predecessor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: I first came to Tokyo to recruit the announcers, and then stayed on for
                    six months. That was in the summer of 1950. But I think what you're talking
                    about is when Jeanne finally got her citizenship. That would be June of
                    1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd forgotten it was that late in the game. I remember Sax
                        Bradford talking about you and saying, “As soon as we can get Hank cleared,
                        we'll get him out here.” But I didn't remember when it was that you actually
                        showed up. I came in January of '52 and handled the nuts and bolts of the
                        takeover from the Army when the program converted to USIS. We had 24 field
                        centers, about 840 Japanese and 135 American positions authorized. We never
                        filled them all, but we did get about 100 on duty before Washington ordered
                        us to start cutting back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: I remember when I was first assigned there on TDY in 1950, USIS was in the
                    Mitsui Bank building. Then we moved to the Mitsubishi Shoji building. Then from
                    there to the Mantetsu building. I guess that was over a span of some 15
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I came out in January of 1952, we were in the
                        Mitsubishi Shoji building near the Tokyo Station.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: There was one more before that. We were in the Mitsui Bank building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we moved to the Mantetsu. I've forgotten now whether
                        it was late fall of 1952 or the early part of 1953, but it was right in that
                        two-or three-month period. We moved up either around November of '52 or
                        sometime the first month or two of '53. By the time you came out on
                        assignment, we were already in the Mantetsu building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>USIS Able to Saturate Japanese Radio with ItsLocally Produced Programs in
                    Mid-1950's</p>
                <p>GOSHO: That's right. As I mentioned, Victor Hauge was the chief of the radio
                    branch. Vic had already embarked on an ambitious radio program project. The plan
                    was to furnish the commercial stations with USIS radio programs that they could
                    use in the early days, because there was nobody that would sponsor any of the
                    time slots, mainly because Japanese businesses were not familiar with business
                    of sponsorship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And — they didn't have much money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: They didn't have much money. But Vic Hauge saw this as an excellent
                    opportunity to get our message across through the radio programs that we would
                    furnish them free. We started out, as I recall, with two or three programs. One
                    I remember was called “Family Album,” which was a program that talked about
                    household hints, how things were done in the US, how it might work in Japan. It
                    was an excellent way, I thought, to get our American message to the Japanese. A
                    lot of the letters that we received showed that there were listeners.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>It was an ideal situation, as you might guess, because there was a lack of
                    sponsors in Japan, we were able to get USIS radio programs on the air in prime
                    time, which was, in those days, between 6:00 and 9:30.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, at that time there were no networks in Japan
                        at all. You were dealing with a group of independent stations, and therefore
                        had to deliver your taped programs to stations all over the country, each
                        one of which played individually. They were all pretty low-power
                        stations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes, that's right. Radio Tokyo was the first commercial station in Japan,
                    followed by Osaka, then by Nagoya, and then eventually into Fukuoka, and up to
                    Hokkaido. We were fortunate in that in each of those major cities, we had a
                    cultural center. So that the cultural center director was able to make contact
                    with the radio station and establish a relationship, which helped in carrying
                    out the cultural center activities in his own area.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the radio stations formed networks. Primarily they were owned by the
                    Asahi newspaper organization, which had one network. The Mainichi newspaper had
                    another network, and the Yomiuri, the third. Those are the three main media
                    newspapers in Japan. These later on branched out into TV.</p>
                <p>Our programs were made up of a mix of music, “Family Album,” which was more of a
                    home aid type of program, but we would weave USIS country objectives into the
                    program. We also had what we would call talk shows. I think there were two or
                    three what we called commentary talk shows.</p>
                <p>One on which we put a lot of emphasis was a military program for which we were
                    able to utilize a prominent military commentator who would talk about the
                    security pact, what it intended to do and what it hoped to do, but mainly to
                    keep the peace. We would receive letters from audiences. Not all were in favor
                    of what was being said, but nonetheless, we thought that it was worthwhile, in
                    that at least it got the people thinking about the security pact and what it
                    meant to Japan.</p>
                <p>On another commentary program, we invited former Washington correspondents or New
                    York correspondents who were the Asahi or Mainichi or Yomiuri correspondents,
                    and they would talk about international politics, relating mainly to US and
                    Japan affairs.</p>
                <p>Another commentary program was a US-Japan economic talk show. We were able to
                    place these programs initially on prime-time programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the feedback on the military programs.
                        Did you get any feedback on the correspondents' program and the economic
                        program that you were putting on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>GOSHO: We received many comments on the current topic programs mostly that they
                    appreciated the program and they enjoyed it. But I think that that was mostly
                    because they were able to read in their own local newspapers on current topics
                    or current events. But on the economic programs, we would receive comments that
                    there were some aspects in it that they hadn't realized, and they thanked us for
                    the educational info that was being provided.</p>
                <p>Of course, the most popular shows were the music shows. We had country and
                    western, which was very popular at the time. I wasn't much of a country and
                    western fan, but there were quite a few in Japan, strangely enough because at
                    that time square dancing was very popular. That went across great, and we got
                    quite a few requests for that type of music. Although we did have classical
                    music, such as the Boston Symphony. Those were very popular, so popular, in
                    fact, that we got a request from Suntory Whiskey Company that they wanted to
                    sponsor one of the shows. We thought, “Gee, that would be terrific.” So we sent
                    a message to Washington, but the legal beagle said no, an alcoholic beverage
                    program would not be appropriate, besides which they advised that a US
                    Government-operated program could not be commercially sponsored. So that one
                    went by the wayside.</p>
                <p>There was, as I recall, a JTB (Japan Travel Bureau) or similar organization that
                    did sponsor one of our shows without our knowing it. The program had to do with
                    a tour of the United States, that would do a show about the Grand Canyon or
                    about national parks or about various cities, and how they were related to
                    Japan, so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you mentioned at one point in our conversation
                        before we were recording, that you would occasionally put on shows that
                        would review or report on certain articles that appeared in major US
                        periodicals, and some of them in the medical field, which got a great
                        response.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes, In the program called 'Family Album,' we would from time to time
                    insert either new findings or interesting findings by the American medical
                    field, either an article out of the AMA journal or the Harvard medical journal.
                    I've forgotten which it was. But quite often we would receive inquiries from a
                    medical college in Japan, saying that they heard the program and could we
                    furnish them with more detailed data on it. In many cases, we were able to
                    furnish them with additional data, and if we couldn't, we would write them and
                    tell them that we were looking further into their request. This was one of those
                    things you call evidence of effectiveness.</p>
                <p>Later-Near 1960: Commercial Sponsorship Begins;USIS is Pushed Out of
                    Prime-Time</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>At the height of the radio branch operation, we had between 30 and 40 programs,
                    the majority of which were on prime time. But as the years went by, commercial
                    sponsorship caught on. I would guess around seven or eight years later, we began
                    to get pushed out of prime-time programming. But interestingly enough, the
                    stations would make another effort to ask us if they could only sponsor “Family
                    Album,” for instance, saying they could still carry it on in prime time. But
                    since that was impossible, it would be shoved back to, say, around 1:00 at
                    night, and eventually midnight. Pretty soon, the only time we were on the air
                    was 1:00 in the morning and 4:00 in the morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in your heyday and furnishing all these
                        programs to individual stations, did you have “traveling salesmen” who would
                        go out and make contact with the various radio stations first to get them
                        acclimated to taking your product, and later perhaps to getting a feedback
                        from then as to what they wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: We had a system where if I didn't go out, then our top FSL or local
                    employee would go out with, let's say, three or four sample programs. Maybe two
                    tapes would be music tapes. That was a good come-on, because good music programs
                    in those early days were hard to come by in Japan. The prime program that you
                    really wanted to sell was either a commentary or “Family Album”. In most cases,
                    they knew that if they picked one or both music programs, they were, more or
                    less, obliged to take the talk show or the commentary program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the height of utilization of your programs around
                        Japan, approximately how many stations were you servicing? What is your
                        evaluation, overall, of that earlier period, say the first five or six years
                        that you were on the air through so many Japanese stations, as to the
                        influence the programs had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: When we first started out, there were only three or four stations, but at
                    the peak, we serviced in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 stations. In fact I would
                    have to say that it was probably higher, because when you got into the
                    hinterlands of Japan, as you know, it's a mountainous island, they had there
                    what they called slave stations. So if Nagoya carried a program, it was
                    generally also carried by the slave station, which would be maybe as many as
                    three or four additional. So we probably serviced, at the peak moments, about
                    100 stations.</p>
                <p>When television came in, I would guess about 1958-59, we started out with three
                    or four programs, and ended up with three or four programs. Of those three, two
                    were English conversation-type programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes, teaching. One was just pure elementary English, but the other one, we
                    used VOA's Special English material which enjoyed some success. The other two
                    were documentaries which were furnished by the Agency's TV and MOPIX Service.
                    But, you know, television caught on very fast in Japan. By that time, commercial
                    sponsorship was making rapid headway, so there was not much need by the Japanese
                    to depend on us for furnishing material.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than the correspondence you received as a result of
                        your programs, did you have any kind of an indication that you were making
                        some headway with messages in the programming that you were preparing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: In a negative sense, and yet the fact that we got some negative responses
                    to it, it was an indication that they were listening. We had a military program,
                    not in the sense of warfare or defense — well, it had to do with Japanese
                    defense, but we had a military commentator who, interestingly enough, we were
                    able to get from the Asahi newspaper, whose policy at the time was generally
                    anti-American. By anti-American, I would say they were more pro-Japanese than
                    they were anti-American. But we were able to get a military editor, who would
                    talk about the nuclear protective aspects of visiting submarines or nuclear
                    aircraft carriers. The Japanese were Hiroshima conscious, and so anything that
                    had to do with nukes, they were against. But this military commentator tried to
                    inform them of just what it was that the US-Japan defense was doing. As I say,
                    not all the letters we got in that connection were favorable; a lot of them
                    protested trying to justify nuclear weapons. But at least, as I say, it showed
                    they were listening to the program.</p>
                <p>USIS Arranges to Broadcast World Series to Japan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that at one time USIS was arranging to
                        broadcast World Series games. Tell me how that came about and what role you
                        played in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: (Laughs) That was before I was assigned at Tokyo. It occurred to me that
                    even before the war, baseball was extremely popular in Japan. Probably, next to
                    sumo, it was considered the national pastime. But because of that, I suggested
                    to the Agency — well, at the time it was in State — I put in a proposal, which
                    was approved, that we broadcast the World Series in Japanese to Japan. As it
                    happened, I had gone to Japan earlier to recruit three NHK announcers, two of
                    which happened to be sports announcers, so we were well prepared. I did the
                    color commentary on it. Broadcasting a World Series was a great thrill to me,
                    because I played baseball in high school in Japan, and it had always been my
                    dream to see a World Series. Here I got the opportunity to do so.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>One of the highlights of the World Series was when I conducted an interview with
                    Casey Stengal, manager of the New York Yankees. I had asked him whether he
                    foresaw a day when they would have a real World Series with the champion of
                    America playing the champion of Japan. His response was, “You know, I went to
                    Japan in 1934 with Babe Ruth, and now there was a great player.” He talked about
                    Babe Ruth, and he said that Babe Ruth had gone to England. “Now, England, that's
                    a different situation. Baseball is not all that popular in Europe, but
                    eventually there will be a day when baseball will become popular.” He switched
                    from one topic to another so rapidly, in the blink of an eyelash, that I had a
                    great deal of trouble interpreting what he said, Nonetheless, it went out over
                    the air.</p>
                <p>About two weeks later, we got several letters from Japan, saying, “We couldn't
                    understand a word of what that interpreter was saying.” Well, what the heck. I
                    couldn't understand a word of what Casey was trying to say either.</p>
                <p>The significance, though, of that World Series was that we got reports from USIS
                    Tokyo that there was an estimated audience of between 5 to 7 million who heard
                    all seven games. That was one of the highlights of radio broadcasting, even in
                    Japan, as the first broadcast in Japanese. Of course, today the Japanese are
                    here not only broadcasting the World Series, but the Super Bowl, as well.</p>
                <p>USIS Trained Many Young Japanese Who Later BecameAnnouncers on Japanese Radio
                    Stations or Networks</p>
                <p>Another sidebar on the radio branch operation in Tokyo was that we had several
                    local radio producers who were just starting out. In other words, they graduated
                    from university and they'd apply for a job at USIS, and we would take them on as
                    assistants to the main producer. Later, as Agency budget cuts came, they would
                    move on to Japanese radio stations. Eventually we had quite a large alumni group
                    of former USIS radio branch employees who were working for various radio
                    stations throughout Japan. We were invited to attend what the Japanese called
                    the NARB, the National Association of Radio Broadcasters, patterned after the
                    NARB here in the States. It was like old home week. I would go and be greeted by
                    these various former workers of USIS.</p>
                <p>Radio/TV Phase Down: Gosho Becomes Chief ofInformation Division, USIS Tokyo</p>
                <p>Eventually the radio and TV programs sort of faded out, and more emphasis was put
                    on the information side. USIS was divided into the Information Division and the
                    Cultural Division. I was assigned to head up the Information Division, made up
                    of Radio/TV, MOPIX, Publications, and Exhibits Branches. My last assignment in
                    Tokyo was Expo 1970 in Osaka. Although talking about expositions, I was called
                    out of retirement in 1984 and 1985 to be the deputy commissioner of the US
                    Pavilion at Tsukuba.</p>

                <p>Planning for President Eisenhower's 1960 Visit to Japan</p>
                <p>There are many memories of the long years spent in Tokyo. I guess one of the most
                    memorable was in 1959, towards the end of the year, I'd say around November.
                    Harry Keith, chief of the Mopix operation, and I were assigned full-time to the
                    upcoming visit by President Eisenhower in Japan. It had been announced in
                    October of 1959, that in 1960, President Eisenhower would schedule a visit to
                    Japan and it would be the first time that a US President would visit Japan. So
                    it was to be a big event. Harry Keith and I were on it seven days a week, 24
                    hours a day, practically, as were two from the Foreign Office. We worked as a
                    team in submitting various suggested schedules to Washington.</p>
                <p>The main difficulty was that we had to time everything down to the nth inch of
                    what was to happen. For example, on the program there was a luncheon to be given
                    at the Imperial Hotel. First of all, we had to submit the menu to Washington.
                    The menu was approved. Then Harry Keith and I and the two from the Foreign
                    Office, and two from the White House came, and we sat down in the Banquet Room
                    at the Imperial Hotel and actually ate what was to be served to the President.
                    Somehow or other, when dessert time came, the waiter brought out vanilla ice
                    cream. We were just about to dig into it when the White House medical officer
                    says, “No, no! We can't have that. There's too much cholesterol in it.” So the
                    ice cream had to be scrubbed.</p>
                <p>As I say, everything had to be timed to the minute. The visit to the Mejii
                    Shrine, the oldest shrine in Tokyo, was on the schedule. One of the problems
                    there was that there were no telephones readily available. As you know, the
                    President has to have at each station the ability to make direct contact with
                    the Washington switchboard. As after a great deal of negotiations and whatnot,
                    they were finally able to install one telephone just outside the shrine admin
                    office, much to the chagrin of the high priest who objected to it. That was my
                    first experience with picking up a phone and having the White House switchboard
                    come right on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you remember, in our early days out there, we were
                        reduced to radio telephone, and very often it was almost impossible to hold
                        a conversation between Tokyo and Washington. On this occasion, what had they
                        done to improve communications so that you had a much better
                        connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: The telephone at the shrine, for example, went directly to the switchboard
                    at the embassy, and then the switchboard at the embassy went to the USAFJ, the
                    US Army Forces in Japan, headquarters in Fuchu, I think it was, and their
                    switchboard was able to patch right into the White House.</p>

                <p>Everything wasn't work in preparing for the President's visit. As a “take-off” on
                    the requirement of communicating at all times with Washington, we came up with a
                    little skit where the President is in audience with the Emperor, and there's a
                    familiar red pay phone installed right next to the throne. As the President is
                    bowing, the phone rings. The Emperor picks up the phone and he says, “Hai.” Then
                    he hands the phone over to the President and says, “Its for you.” (Laughs)</p>
                <p>All the Planning Wasted: Riots Force Cancellationof Visit - June, 1960</p>
                <p>The upshot of the whole thing, after all the months of preparation, papers after
                    papers, Plan A, fair-weather schedule, Plan B, wet-weather schedules, and all
                    these things where you had to measure things by the minute, by the second, the
                    upshot was Mr. Hagerty, the President's press secretary, flew into Haneda
                    airport two weeks before the President was scheduled to arrive. We had already
                    had indications there was going to be trouble. There were quite a few
                    demonstrations already going strong. I think it was for that reason that Mr.
                    Hagerty flew into Tokyo to get a final reading. I believe the President was
                    already in Okinawa, when Mr. Hagerty came in. You couldn't get into the airport
                    because of the demonstrators. I was there well in advance of Mr. Hagerty's
                    arrival. The Japanese security officer in charge of Haneda airport came to me
                    and said, “A US helicopter is on standby. He's flying in now. We would strongly
                    recommend that Mr. Hagerty avoid the demonstrators and take the chopper and use
                    that to get to the embassy.”</p>
                <p>So when Mr. Hagerty's plane arrived, I went up the ramp and I gave him the
                    message. He just looked at me and said, “No American official is going to go in
                    by the back door. I will use the embassy car and proceed that way.”</p>
                <p>Well, he got no more than a few blocks at the far end of the runway there, and
                    the cars couldn't move because of the demonstrators. They were pounding the car
                    with their placards. This was in June of 1960. It was hotter than hell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was about the time we were due to renegotiate the
                        Security treaty, as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the basis for the rioting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: That was the basis. Well, at that stage it wasn't rioting yet, but there
                    were protest demonstrations and creating just general havoc. As a matter of
                    fact, I believe that in one of the demonstrations at the Diet, a high school
                    girl was crushed to death. That caused further problems. That was also one of
                    the reasons why Hagerty came in.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>It was hot in those cars. The engines overheated, and we had all the windows
                    closed, and they were pounding the car with these placards. I was in the car
                    directly behind Ambassador [Douglas] MacArthur III and Mr. Hagerty. There was a
                    knock on the window. I looked out, and there was the chief of the security
                    forces. I lowered the window, and he said, “I want you to go tell Ambassador
                    MacArthur that your US Army chopper is going to hover over the cars. When I give
                    the signal, they're going to lower a rope ladder. When I give the signal, I
                    would like to have the ambassador and Mr. Hagerty get out of the car and climb
                    up the rope ladder and take off.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You're out of your cotton-picking mind! You don't want me to go out in
                    that crowd, do you?” (Laughs)</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I can't do it. I don't speak English!!”</p>
                <p>I finally said, “Okay.” As I got out of the car, I got hit in the head with one
                    of the demonstrator's placards, and I turned around, more in pain rather than
                    anger, and this Japanese fellow that hit me on the head with the placard bowed
                    low and said, “Excuse me. Sorry about that.” (Laughs) Out of that emotional bit,
                    there's that little bit of to-do that remained in my mind.</p>
                <p>I went up to the car and told the ambassador what was going to happen. When the
                    signal was given, they came out of the car. But as you know, when you're
                    standing directly under a chopper, it raises a dust storm the likes you've never
                    seen before, especially when it's so low. They got out and climbed up the rope
                    ladder into the chopper, and it took off. As soon as the chopper took off and
                    the main object of the demonstrators had gone, why, the crowd just disappeared,
                    and we were able to proceed back to the embassy.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the chopper had landed at a place called Hardy Barracks, which
                    is less than a mile away from the embassy. Mr. Hagerty and the ambassador drove
                    directly through the back roads to the residence. When I arrived, Mr. Hagerty
                    was chewing Ambassador MacArthur out for not providing the proper intelligence.
                    (Laughs) I don't know what he could have done about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it at that point that Hagerty decided that he was
                        going to recommend the cancellation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes. The President was in Okinawa, and they had the President go to Seoul.
                    Prime Minister Kishi appeared tearfully on TV and announced that the President's
                    visit had been canceled. I believe within the next day or so, Prime Minister
                    Kishi resigned.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were discussing earlier the value of use of Japanese
                        language by American diplomats, and to some extent that it was
                        counterproductive in certain instances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: First of all, I'd like to mention that the majority of my service was in
                    Japan — I can only speak for Japan. Over the past several years I have found the
                    Foreign Service officers' linguistic abilities to be top grade. Especially I
                    found that those in USIS were of high caliber.</p>
                <p>However, I have one observation to make, and I think it still applies. I remember
                    an incident back in the days when USIS would invite the Japanese media for a get
                    together, and almost the entire USIS staff and Japanese correspondents, foreign
                    news editors, and so forth were invited. Mr. Watanabe of the Osaka Mainichi,
                    chief of the foreign news desk, who was educated in the States, spoke excellent
                    English, appeared at the cocktail party, as he always did. He was a great fan of
                    USIS. As a matter of fact, come to think of it, Mr. Watanabe was one of those
                    who appeared on our commentary programs in the early days. Anyway, he came to me
                    towards the end of the party, a little bit upset, and said, “You know, one of
                    your officers kept insisting on talking Japanese to me.” He pointed him out.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, he's a recent graduate of the Yokohama Language School.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Watanabe said, “Well, since you and I are old friends, I can be frank with
                    you. Every time I responded in English, he came back at me in his Japanese,
                    which was not bad but not all that good. I think he should realize that when
                    someone answers back in English, that they should then droop the second language
                    and respond in English, because it tells the person that his English isn't
                    understandable, and it's a breach of etiquette.” Also a breach of diplomacy, as
                    far as that goes. So despite the fact that there are excellent linguists,
                    there's always a time and place when they should respond in English if the guest
                    talks to you or answers your questions or carries on a conversation in
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But on the whole, you feel that the diplomatic students
                        speak a pretty good version of Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: However, as we all know, the Japanese language is full of
                        many nuances. To what extent do you think that a student in a couple years
                        of study can pick up those nuances? Or do we miss an awful lot of them? Is
                        that one of the great faults or inabilities in our language learning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes. I can only speak for the Japanese language, but it is a language full
                    of nuances, which is probably some of the reasons for many misunderstandings
                    that arise between the US and Japan — the nuances of the language.</p>
                <p>I recall in the early days, when Washington sent the post a message, asking that
                    such and such be transmitted to the foreign Office, I accompanied the Ambassador
                    to the Foreign Office. The message was transmitted. The Foreign Office official
                    said, in Japanese, “I generally understand.” “I got the gist,” would be the more
                    accurate translation. Except that the ambassador took it as an acceptance of the
                    message.</p>
                <p>We returned to the embassy, and a draft telegram was written that they had
                    accepted. As the accompanying officer, I was required to initial the message. I
                    said, “No, I don't think this is correct. What they actually said was they'll
                    study it. It was not an acceptance.” From that day forward, the ambassador
                    agreed that henceforth anything official would be handled in the English
                    language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that Sen Nishiyama, who, for general purposes I'll
                        identify as the top local employee in the US Information Service operation,
                        and who was born in the United States, got a degree in the US, and then went
                        to Japan and lived there ever after, is probably the best example of a
                        bilingual person that we have. But he and Reischauer used to get into some
                        rather unpleasant arguments over the utilization of certain phrases in
                        Japanese, and the ambassador would insist that the way he was saying it was
                        the way it ought to be. Sen, in his very polite way, was trying to tell
                        Reischauer that it really wasn't the way it should be said. I suppose that
                        is due to the fact that the language had progressed since Reischauer learned
                        it. Sen, of course, had been there all the time and knew all the current
                        nuances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: I think that may have been true in the initial stages, but initially, it
                    got quite a response from the audience. I recall that at one of the speeches he
                    made, the ambassador had made a longer-than-normal talk in English before the
                    translation. Normally he got to a convenient place so Sen could translate. But
                    on that particular occasion, he had talked a little longer. Either that or he
                    forgot that Sen had to translate it. Anyway, it was quite long. Sen translated
                    it as best he could, and when Sen finished, the ambassador said, “Well, that
                    wasn't exactly what I said. What I said was ...” and the ambassador started
                    talking in Japanese. It brought much laughter, and a humorous air was
                    interjected. So it became kind of an act, and it was a good one, because it
                    showed the humorous side of the ambassador, and Sen realized it, too. They
                    continued this “act” many more times.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>But I agree. Sen, without a doubt, is the best interpreter of English into
                    Japanese and vice versa that I've ever heard. He compares well with Mr.
                    Shimanouchi, who was Prime Minister Kishi's personal secretary and interpreter.
                    Mr. Shimanouchi spent his early years in Los Angeles and was educated at UCLA,
                    so his English was perfect, too. When Prime Minister Kishi came to Washington as
                    the first post-war high Japanese official to address the Congress, Mr.
                    Shimanouchi, did the interpreting. When Prime Minister Kishi finished his speech
                    and Mr. Shimanouchi ended with “Thank you very much.” [I forgot to mention that
                    Mr. Shimanouchi was a debater at UCLA, so his English language is flawless.],
                    the congressmen and senators came over and all shook Mr. Shimanouchi's hand, and
                    sort of left the prime minister standing out in the cold. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>Value of US Participation in International Fairs:Disappointed with US Exhibit at
                    1985 Tsukuba Fair</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that after you officially retired from the Agency,
                        you were brought back a couple of times, largely to do the work on the
                        preparation of the American Pavilion, at one or another of the international
                        exhibitions, I think beginning with the Expo '70, and then later just two or
                        three years ago. I'd like to get your impressions as to how you felt about
                        the value of the US participation in these presentations, and what did it do
                        for our relations with the Japanese? Do you have any feeling on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes. I think US participation in any international exposition,
                    particularly in Japan, the US participation is always expected. I remember, as
                    far back as 1970, we were having budget problems. Mr. Chernoff allowed as how
                    the maximum he could get was $9 million. Of course, $9 million in 1970 was worth
                    a lot more than it is now. Today that probably wouldn't get half as much as what
                    we got in those days. I think the US participation is important and is highly
                    desirable. But having said that, I think if you're not going to do it right,
                    then don't do it, because I think we look bad when we put out a poor
                    exhibit.</p>
                <p>The main theme of the US Pavilion at the 1985 Tsukuba [Japan] Exposition was on
                    Artificial Intelligence. For the most part, in my estimation, our exhibit was
                    mediocre. I think we could have done much better. We had various American
                    private industry participation, but, it was evident that they did not want to
                    display any more than necessary to the Japanese, what progress was being made in
                    the US. But in that respect, I think we could have done much better at Expo '85
                    with a much higher technological showing than was given. Every one of the
                    Japanese high-tech industries, such as Fujitsu, IBM of Japan, and Sony, all said
                    that what was exhibited in the US Pavilion they already knew. Some of it was
                    already previously shown in Japan. So from that viewpoint, it was a
                    disappointment. But they said the mere fact that the US participated was part of
                    the success of the exposition, and that if the US didn't participate, the local
                    people would have considered it a failure.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think, of course, up until fairly recently, if the US
                        appeared, as you said, there were great expectations, and perhaps
                        expectations aroused beyond the level of our ability to produce. So if the
                        US came in with anything less than the expectations, it was not as good a
                        show as it should have been.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now since the Japanese are ahead of us, it does become
                        rather difficult sometimes, particularly in Japan. I guess it's safe to say
                        that your evaluation is, as you said before, unless you're going to put on
                        the very best that you have, you shouldn't do it at all. Pick a field in
                        which you can come on strong and be the actual best in the world if you
                        possibly can. Otherwise, don't do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: That's right. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in your estimation, obviously the '85 show did not
                        compare with the success of the '0 show.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: No, it didn't. Although what made the 1970 exposition was the moon rock
                    and the spaceship, the actual space vehicle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The smaller unit sent down to explore the surface.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Yes. It was timely, and there was no doubt that, by far, the moon rock
                    made the 1970 exposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In conclusion, is there any other comment you would like
                        to make about the USIA programs abroad as you have seen them through your
                        experience, and what they have accomplished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Having gotten into USIA when it was born, then retired after USIA had
                    firmly established itself, I think it has come of age in its overseas programs.
                    In my travels since retirement I observed that the State Department has accepted
                    USIS's role. Particularly they've come to realize that handling presidential
                    visits or handling visits of high US officials is not something that anybody can
                    do, but requires a professional knowledge. It's heartening to me to see that
                    USIS and the Agency has arrived and has firmly establish itself.</p>
                <p>Breaking Up USIA Would Be A Serious Mistake</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're right. I don't know to what extent you are aware of
                        it because you're not in the Washington area where it comes up all the time,
                        but there is a systematic effort being made on the part of a number of
                        people in Washington now to break up the Agency, return the information part
                        of it to the State Department, who apparently wants it now!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: Full cycle. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Full cycle. To give the cultural aspect of it to some
                        outfit like the Smithsonian Institution, and to make the Voice completely
                        independent, an organization not responsible to anyone else. What would you
                        say, for instance, if the State Department which now already has a public
                        relations staff of about 150 people, attempted to take over something like a
                        presidential visit abroad? Because to break up the Agency would remove the
                        experienced USIS staff from overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: The inner workings of a presidential visit, for instance, requires a full
                    knowledge of how the local media operates. It requires establishing good working
                    relation- ships with the local press, with the local TV and with the local media
                    in general. The regular FSOs don't have that time. They're concentrating on
                    politics, political and economic reports. Whereas with USIS, that's their job,
                    as professionals, to establish a working relationship with the local media. It's
                    that kind of contact that is so important in the making of a successful
                    visit.</p>
                <p>I think that, in this day and age, the need for and the importance of a Public
                    Relations Program is understood by all. A Cultural Activity, I believe, also
                    fits into this category. I think it would be a mistake to put the Information
                    Program back into the State Department.</p>
                <p>Looking at it from another angle. A selfish viewpoint. The situation may not
                    exist today but in the past a State Department FSO in the “Public Affairs” or
                    “Cultural” cone found promotions hard to come by. The reason being that the
                    system seemed to lean towards and favor FSO's in the “Political” and “Economic”
                    cones. The result would be that it would become difficult to get highly
                    professional personnel to come into the program. They would shy away.</p>

                    Education in the 1930's?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Early in this interview, you mentioned that your two
                        brothers who had gone to Japan with you for educational purposes and did not
                        return before Pearl Harbor as you did, had gone on to serve: one in the
                        Japanese Navy and the other in the Japanese Army Medical Corps. I think it
                        would be of interest to know what your brothers did after the War. I assume
                        they stayed on in Japan, since for some years after the Armistice, Nisei who
                        had even been in Japan when the War came, let alone served in the Japanese
                        military forces, were denied continuance of American citizenship, and could
                        not return. Did your brothers ever return to the US? To visit? To live? If
                        they are still living, what are they doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOSHO: My older brother, having graduated from the Chemical Engineering
                    Department of Waseda University in Tokyo, served in the Japanese Navy as a “Fuel
                    Research Officer”. He told me, after the War, that from the very beginning he
                    was assigned, first, to the “Fuel Research Office”. Later, as the Pacific War
                    began going downhill in 1943 and the need for fuel oil for the Japanese fleet
                    became acute, he and many other Fuel Officers were assigned research on
                    “Synthetic Oil”. He told me with the double entendre that “it was a losing
                    battle!!” He spent the entire War in Japan.</p>
                <p>After the War he was employed by the C. Ito Trading Company in their Chemical
                    Section. Later he became head of their Plastic Products Department. He retired
                    in 1988 and now resides with his family in Takarazuka, Hyogo Prefecture.</p>
                <p>My younger brother, while still enrolled in the Okayama Medical University,
                    served part-time as a “medical trainee intern” with the Japanese Army Hospital
                    in Okayama. He, also, spent the entire War in Okayama.</p>
                <p>After the War he continued his studies at the Okayama Medical University but in
                    1946 [or '47] he was notified by the American Consulate in Osaka that his
                    passport application for return to Seattle, Washington, had been approved. He
                    finished his studies at the University of Washington's College of Pharmacy and
                    joined our father in the Gosho Drug Company. He is now retired and resides in
                    Bellevue, Washington.</p>
                <p>POSTSCRIPT: I have been often asked the following question: Did the knowledge
                    that you might face your brothers in combat worry you??”</p>
                <p>My response was [1]; When I was in basic training at Camp Shelby, Mississippi;
                    Army Intelligence training at Camp Savage, Minnesota and on the troop ship to
                    Burma via India, the thought was constantly on my mind. But [2]; once in combat
                    I was too occupied with the battle at hand and with “survival”.</p>
