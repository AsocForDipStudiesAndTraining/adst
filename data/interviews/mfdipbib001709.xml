                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, here we are. This is Dan Whitman at the University
                        of Pretoria. This is the 5th of March, 2009, and we're going to talk to Gill
                        Jacot Guillarmod. And what we should do first, Gill, because there's a
                        transcriber involved here, could you spell your name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Sure. It's G-I-L-L; that's actually an abbreviation, my
                    official name is G-I-L-I-A-N, and my surname is long, J-A-C-O-T, new word,
                    G-U-I-L-L-A-R-M-O-D.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Thanks, Gill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, when you were working at the U.S. embassy at Pretoria, you had spent several
                    decades working on cultural exchanges and other types of things. I'd like to ask
                    you first, where were you born?</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I was born in Cape Town in 1942, and I joined the embassy there
                    in 1964. And I was there for five years until I left to come to Pretoria to be
                    married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you say embassy; in those days it-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: It was USIS (United States Information Service).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -the embassy used to go back and forth, I believe, from
                        Pretoria to Cape Town, depending on whether Parliament was in session.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes but we had an American consulate general and I was with the
                    little- tiny little USIS office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tiny little USIS office within the consulate.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Now, going back, sorry, you said '64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Sixty-four to '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we think of when this started really changing in the
                        '90s, this was 30 years before. So tell me what you can remember of the
                        things that you did during those five years and what was it like in Cape
                        Town at that time, with the- Well, the previous system, as it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, it was horrible. I mean, it was better, I have to say
                    when I joined there I really wasn't aware of quite how horrible it was. My being
                    with the embassy affected by outlook on life and I had the great privilege of
                    being- I was a Gill of all trades because we had a librarian and then there was
                    Gill, and I did the press placement and I did the film library. I used to take
                    movies into the townships in the big old station wagon and screen films.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixteen millimeter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Sixteen millimeter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old threading the machine and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And the sprockets would break and have to stick- And the most
                    popular, there were two movies that were really population, “The Golden Age of
                    Comedy” and the other one was “Years of Lightening, Day of Drums,” but I always
                    took along our propaganda as well in the hope that they would- the audience
                    would enjoy that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, when you mention townships, I know there were
                        restrictions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. I went usually to Guguletu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guguletu. Were there restrictions on the people classified
                        as whites in going into the townships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes but I was in a dip car and I never, ever had a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Were you usually accompanied by an American diplomat
                        when you went? Sometimes yes, sometimes no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Usually no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually no, okay. Now, was this a given already in 1964
                        that 16 millimeter films- What were the tools of the trade back then? Films,
                        press releases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: The library. Oh, and a lot of press, a great deal press. We
                    used to get all those, you might remember from IPS (Inter Press Service)
                    thousands of photographs, all these photographs and multiple copies of them,
                    many of them with no captions on the photo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the photo archives from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. And then everything about, or desalinization and the
                    Hoover Dam and just all sorts of things to tell America's story to the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what were you able to do with these materials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: With the press I used to- When I worked for a new BPAO (Branch
                    Public Affairs Officer), David Michael Wilson, David- you know David- and David
                    decided I was young and blonde and mini skirted in those days that just sending
                    the things in the mail would just- the press stuff would all just land up in
                    some news editor's in drop box and not get used. I used to take the things up
                    to- go up to the “Burger” and the “Argus” and the “Cape Times” and then get to
                    meet people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The local papers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And it- it definitely did improve placement. I'm not saying
                    that was because I was young and blonde; I think it was the personal, you know,
                    actually handing it over to somebody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you worked with David on this, with his
                        encouragement you went and you made frequent- you actually-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I used to go once or twice a week up to the three main
                    newspapers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Three; “Argus,” “Burger,” and then another one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: “Times.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “Times,” okay. So this was purely a Cape Town
                        activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although Cape Town had its importance as the
                        parliament-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Of course, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: and at that time- it was parliament, basically, yes. Now,
                        parliament was in session, I think half a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: From January to June; end of January to June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what used to happen from June to January then? You
                        were still there, you were-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would things slow down a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I can't even think that it was quiet, actually, because I think
                    we always were doing things with education, with University of Cape Town; NUCES,
                    the student body was- we were very active and we tried to work with them quite a
                    lot. And with the- in those days there was that big high building behind us, the
                    South African Information Service was there and the BPAOs would make a point of
                    mixing and establishing relationships with the officials from South African
                    Information Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So even back then it was- was it a tempered thing of
                        trying to be in touch and in contact with all strata of society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, we made a concert- We liked to lay claim to the fact that
                    we provided the first opportunity for a little black theatrical group to
                    perform, and they did a play and I can't now remember the name of it, but they
                    brought into our funny little library that we had and we had a play with a
                    mixed- they were from Guguletu. There was a man there by the name of Ben
                    [Office.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose idea was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: The BPAOs usually.</p>

                    the three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, so you had a team of three?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, no, no, they were successive ones.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I was the secretary to the BPAO so I did, you know, I would do

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Used to get the Wireless File in those days. I used to say oh
                    God, I'm going to get embalmed; when I die they'll bury me and wrap this around
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was paper at that time that came; it was sort of a

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No. Well, there was a photocopier but you did what they called
                    to burn a copy, and you put this piece of paper with- you put another piece of
                    sort of shiny kind of paper over it, and bear in mind I'm technically

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And you would feed the piece of paper with the other copy into
                    this machine, it would go over rollers and then come out on this paper, shiny
                    paper, which eventually then, didn't last for a year, even, I don't think. It
                    would just fade. But you had the copy when you wanted it.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And we used to do that also. If we did a newsletter then you
                    would type that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the type was not so good, it smudged something like

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And it made holes in the paper.</p>

                <p>Now, at the beginning Gill, you were saying that it was horrible. In what way and

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, it was just that- it was just because black people were
                    denied everything.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I think just for the first time the people that I encountered,

                    appointment, come in to ask questions also, would be black people. Before that
                    all the black people I had met had all had menial jobs. They worked in the

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, I can't. It was there when I arrived. It was in Monte Carlo
                    building. The consulate general was in Broadway building and Monte Carlo
                    building was adjoining; there was a big door that separated us. But I used to-
                    and I'd go to work, I would come in through the Monte Carlo entrance.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: You know, I can remember David describing to me how he saw
                    South Africa and he saw it as- there would be- the White people were at the
                    front of the river and then there were the Colored people and then there were
                    the Indian people and then the great big Black crocodile at the back, behind- In
                    the river, if it was a river where you were going.</p>

                        that five year period; any particular program? You mentioned the theater
                        group that you gave a venue; did you do any international visitors or
                        Fulbrighters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No. You know, I didn't have anything to do with exchange

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: They came through Pretoria, yes. And I didn't really
                    understand. I knew that they were students and I've kept my records of people
                    that I had and I knew that there were names of people that I knew came from Cape
                    Town in the '60s who went on the Fulbright program, for instance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: During the time that I was there, and I joined from '64, and
                    then I recognized some of the names of people who would come in to the office;
                    I'd see here a name, Richard Reeve, a famous person, yes, who went and did a
                    Masters in literature at Columbia in 1965; people like that.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I think Johannesburg; I think Johannesburg, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you met a person named Jacot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. But I met him the same year that I joined the embassy,
                    1964 was my year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that's the name you now bear we have to spend a
                        moment finding out what it was that took you from Cape Town to
                        Pretoria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: A wedding ring lured me to the land of the Voortrekker
                    Monument. Indicating nothing else would have. When people used to come into the
                    library and say we hear you're leaving, where are you go, I'd cry and say
                    Pretoria, because Pretoria had such a reputation for conservatism and it
                    deserved its reputation I found, when I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the wedding ring and I think the man who offered it
                        were something of great worth, taking you to a place- you did not want to
                        come to Pretoria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know that before coming that you did not really

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I came to Pretoria for the first time when he had come to
                    Pretoria and then invited me to visit him, which I did, and that was my first
                    exposure. But I just wanted, you know, I wanted to be wed. Let's not go all into
                    the wrinkles or anything.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay so love and marriage triumphed over your sense of
                        place, I guess. Do you remember the day you left Cape Town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, I remember the little farewell party that they had for me
                    and photographs and things. I had a lot of friend; I was very happy and I used
                    to- I enjoyed- I had a couple of wonderful experiences when I was there. Bobby
                    Kennedy came to South Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: and to UCT. And we worked for him and I can remember going into
                    the consul general's office and seeing his- Bobby's aides sitting with their
                    feet up on the desks- I was appalled to see that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He spoke, yes, and we all went up and I can remember my teeny
                    little car, I had Jacot's little gray Vauxhall and we couldn't get up- We
                    followed the cavalcade and then it was just, there were so many- what seemed
                    like thousands of people and probably was close to a thousand, outside in the
                    grounds and we just parked in the middle of the road on the UTC campus and went
                    up into the main hall.</p>

                        moment, what was your involvement with the Robert Kennedy visit?</hi>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: We did some typing for them. It was the UTC visit and then they
                    also went and visited the Simonsberg hostel, a hostel at Stellenbosch
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did Robert Kennedy come? He was attorney general at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh gosh, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it just part of being the Kennedy clan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I think so. And the U.S. saying what they thought about
                    academic freedom and that, because he delivered the academic freedom speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And I know it's, well 30 years, 35 years ago, what do
                        you remember, not the quotes, but what do you remember of the gist of that
                        speech? The text is readily available I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Just encouraging; I don't know that I really remember too much.
                    I think I was so over overwhelmed by the whole occasion, you know, and just
                    being there, part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe what it was that was overwhelming? Was it
                        him, was it the group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: It was also him. Don't forget we were in the presence of the
                    man who everybody thought would be the next president of the United States of
                    America and that was an assumed experience.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. And then we met- we got to meet him afterwards. There was
                    a function at Hedding Hall and he and Mrs. Kennedy were there and he had all his
                    aides and they came along and we got to shake his hand and he said give her a
                    pin, give her a pin, and I still have the U-boat from JFK and that was- I've got
                    that little pin.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh hundreds.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Banner headlines. And then I think we also- I'm trying to think
                    what it was, there were headlines in the paper because he was in Waterkloof; he
                    came to Pretoria after Cape Town, I think, and there were pictures of him
                    walking around Waterkloof shaking hands with domestic workers and gardeners and
                    that, you know.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any sense of the regime at all stressed about
                        this contact? Did they mind, did they care? Was there any sense of being

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, no, no, that doesn't mean to say that it didn't happen but
                    that I can't remember specifically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. It was done subtly perhaps, at times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well maybe not even so subtly because subtlety wasn't part of
                    their vocabulary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, let's get you to Pretoria. Nineteen-</hi>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No. Because the only job they offered me was in the budget and
                    fiscal section and not being able to control my own checkbook I decided no, and
                    I went and worked in commerce for two years. And in those days they didn't used
                    to advertise; all appointments were made by sort of word of mouth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the commerce section of the embassy or the

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, no, just the embassy itself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: The embassy, the personnel section and I got a- I was really
                    getting tired; it was a 20 mile trip each day, you know, there and back to the
                    job that I had and they phoned and asked would I come back. And I came back and
                    for two years I was the FSN (Foreign Service National) assistant to the admin
                    consular and I had a very- didn't have nearly enough to do and I was complaining
                    about that and after awhile they gave me- I would stand in when people were on
                    vacation and it was very valuable. I did a stint in the general services and I
                    got to appreciate what those good folk do. You know, we tend to complain about
                    them but they had their schedule for the day and then the ambassador's wife
                    phones because the loo's broken and they have to drop everything. So I did- I
                    worked-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we complain when things go wrong but we never notice
                        when things go right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: When it goes right, no. I worked in personnel; it was very
                    helpful, I worked in the general services travel section for awhile and I
                    learned a lot, which was to stand me in very good stead when I eventually moved
                    to USIS. I worked in budget and fiscal, all of them, and then, I remember the
                    late Frank Strovis, he was there in those days working with the PAO (public
                    affairs officer), was Perry L. Peterson.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, whom I'm still in touch with. And Frank was his IO, and
                    Frank was dating Marcy McKee, who was the American secretary to the admin
                    counselor and March and I were great friends, and Frank knew that I had had- I'd
                    worked for USIS for five years and my predecessor in the exchange program, a
                    wonderful woman, Mrs. Robbey, who'd been there for a million years, they
                    discovered that she was 70; horror of horrors, you're not allowed to work a day
                    over, I think, 65, and she- and so they wanted to replace her and I got the job
                    because I had the previous-</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: -yes. And Obe Pitswana, Obe the driver and I joined USIS on the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're going to, of course, get to that. I'm going to break
                        the rule of chronology and ask- I should have asked if there's anything you
                        want to point out about your family, your upbringing, your education back at
                        Cape Town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I don't think so. You know, I don't have a- I've got no
                    tertiary qualification or anything. I grew up- I matriculated, I did a
                    secretarial course afterwards at the Technicon and then I worked for a leading
                    firm of jewelers where I did the secretarial work and checked in the jewelry
                    repairs, etc., for two years, then I went to work for an attorney, and I enjoyed
                    that very much. I was there for a year but then he decided to go into commerce
                    and joined a company and that was when I then was unemployed, which was rather
                    nice, Cape Town in February and not having to work and going to the beach, etc.
                    I was only 20, don't forget, and then- No, no, no; I was 21. And then my
                    girlfriend was dating a young political officer and they knew that there was a
                    job break going in USIS, and she was a librarian but she didn't have secretarial
                    skills and I had the secretarial skills which they said was more important than
                    the library, I'd be able to learn about the library, so that's how I got- Ernie
                    Colton was the BPAO who interviewed and employed me.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I remember my first mistake. I can remember- I had great
                    respect for Mr. Peterson; he was very, very nice. There wasn't a cultural
                    attach� at this stage; Jerry Prillaman was yet to come so there was just- there
                    was me and there was the American secretary and there was the RPMAO, budget
                    person. And there was Ghandi Chang, who was Mimi's brother-in-law and he was in
                    the film library; he was also a very able photographer. And my mistake was the
                    grant; the IV grantee was the late Stan Kweyama, who was with the Citrus
                    Exchange. I got a phone call from Mr. Peterson one Saturday morning. I was going
                    to the racing; there was a phone call to say oh, Gill, there's a cable in from
                    Washington and we haven't said when Stan's arriving. And I hadn't, I hadn't sent
                    an ETA cable. I said, oh Mr. Peterson, I'm so sorry; I don't want to get you
                    into trouble. And I came rushing in and sent off the cable so that was very-</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, they were six weeks. And it didn't matter if they took

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: They were allowed to take their spouses. And in fact in many
                    ways they were encouraged to take their spouses, particularly for people who
                    had- who were disadvantaged in that they didn't have big budgets and that to go
                    abroad was a very expensive exercise and you might be able to find the money for
                    one person, and why should one person in the family have this wonderful
                    experience and not be able to share it with his life partner.</p>

                    Federal Chamber of Commerce) and he was a lovely man; he brings back lots of
                    happy memories for me because he used to come into the embassy, well, into USIS,
                    and he didn't have an office or anything and if he- I would make phone calls for
                    him for appointments and with a white- the people would hear a white voice
                    answer, make the call and I'd phone and say please, can I speak to Mr. X, Y Zed
                    and they'd put me through and then I'd hand over and say here's- He ultimately-
                    he got an honorary doctorate; he is Dr. Motsuenyane so I sort of acted as a,

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He was a wonderful, wonderful man, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Now, at what point did you meet these folks? Did
                        you- In some cases were these people that you brought to the attention of

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Occasionally but you know only after I'd been there for awhile.
                    For the first time, if you read that document that I gave you, I give great
                    credit to my colleagues in the embassy and that for spotting “comers,” to use an
                    American expression, that they really- And so many people who you see- who are
                    running South Africa today were the occupied- key positions in our country were
                    identified when they were still ready to be junior staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What types of people were spotting these? Were they South
                        Africans and Americans alike?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: But it was more, it was more the Americans because in the State
                    Department there weren't too many FSNs in the political section and that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the political section people were out and seeing
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: They were seeing things.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I don't know but they certainly- And don't forget it was very
                    different then. It was so easy to identify the good guys and the bad guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it easy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Because any- All the government people were associated, for the
                    most part, you know, you've got the exceptions and then you knew about them but
                    for the most part the government people were associated and I became very
                    anti-government; I became very intolerant, I think, of anybody who I thought
                    didn't agree with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Now, but the embassy was sending some government
                        visitors of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh yes, yes, because they didn't send only the people that
                    they- who liked you; you also sent people you didn't like. I mean, before my
                    time they sent Jimmy Krueger, that dreadful minister of justice who was the one
                    who said that because death left him cold, and I think he went in about
                    1968.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the American agenda was to try to reach every- to not
                        be exclusive, to take people from the various sectors and if they
                        misunderstood us or if we didn't like them, all the more reason for them to
                        have some- if they were leaders-</hi>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Exposure.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: They would send- don't forget, they sent a lot of media, they
                    sent media folk. In the early days, if I go back and I look at my records of
                    before I was involved with exchange program, the majority of people who went
                    were white but gradually as the years went by the numbers-</p>

                        your greater pleasure, was in sending those who did not have the established

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He was a member of parliament for Vereeniging in those days

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, he was from Johannesburg so I- I did the paperwork so it
                    would have my letter- my signature at the bottom of the letter which would have
                    gone sending off his air ticket and his travel allowance and telling him what to
                    expect. But I didn't meet him personally; I really only- I would meet- I
                    obviously met the people who came through the Pretoria office and I used to go
                    to the airport almost without fail, I saw off almost every person of color who
                    went on- In those days it was Pan Am flights twice a week and they went via Rio
                    de Janeiro and beyond.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, why did you feel it was necessary or helpful to

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Because so many of the people that we sent had never flown, had
                    never been out of the country and also to make quite sure that they didn't
                    encounter any difficulties with checking in.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Perhaps; perhaps, yes. And also you wanted them to know that we
                    really wished them well and that- it was nice.</p>

                    from Cape Town to Johannesburg and then it just stopped to refuel,
                    something.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I think there was some- They didn't all go. Don't forget there
                    would be a couple of years when you'd have a particular route and then there
                    were others when they went round through West Africa and across to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And you had to fly American carrier, regardless. It didn't
                    matter if you could get a British Airways at half the price.</p>

                <p>So, do you have any- What would be your guess as to how many people per year
                    benefited from the International Visitors Program in the '70s, '80s in South

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I would do the- No, many more than that; about 35.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And there were partials, too. It was before, really before the
                    volvis [Voluntary Visitors] program grew and what- in those days we called it
                    FSV, facilitated assistance.</p>

                    with counterparts in their field. And occasionally- Now they also give them-
                    even when I was leaving they were giving funding but initially they would set up

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And then I think also, depending on who the officer was, some
                    of them were more, you know, were more proactive; somebody like Jerry
                    Prillaman.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He was CAO, yes, from 1973 to about early '75. I've got

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Did you? About these things? Oh good. Because remember I had

                        it did come from you but I received a note from him related to something
                        else, I think. Anyway, I did have the honor of working with him.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, just outside of Paris. I've got his email address.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: It did not- it was not possible for a white person to go on an

                </p>
                <p>Now, we have to mention, as part of this, that Bart, an African American
                    traveling to South Africa during the apartheid era, he once showed me his visa;
                    it said honorary white.</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Ridiculous.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I just worshipped the ground he walked on. After he'd been here
                    for a few years, it was just wonderful; he always used to let me have a party
                    for him when he was visiting and I always got 100 percent acceptance for that
                    because everybody would just come for Bart.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He came once a year, yes. A shame, you know, even then, I
                    realize now when, you know, after he died, that he had, what's it called?
                    There's an illness call necropsy.</p>

                    of the interviewing process and then I got to be asked and it was lovely and I
                    did that; I did it with- I ended up doing it with Fulbright, I did it with OCA
                    and I used to do the, for IVs I used to do the program suggestions, he met with

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And Bart would nod off in interviews and I would, you know,
                    take over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes. And sometimes an alumnus.</p>

                        but we should mention that Bart died in a car accident when he was driving
                        at night on the Taconic Freeway in New York State, and we think he fell
                        asleep; he was driving to Boston.</hi>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. Because he'd been to a farewell party that they were

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. And he was very kind because he used to say to me, oh
                    Gill, what can I do to repay you? And I said, in 1988 I said, there's something
                    you can do. I had a whole lot of South Africans studying in New York at that
                    stage and he let me cook them a meal in his apartment on 121st Street in Harlem,
                    and I walked from 42nd Street to 121st Street and then I went and did shopping,
                    cooking and they all came along. It was a most marvelous evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you cooked a meal for South African visitors in Bart's
                        home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: A chicken dinner in Bart's home, yes. And many of those, the
                    Fulbrighters and the OCAs and the AFGRADs, then all became friends also; people
                    met who hadn't met other than that. So Bart was such a catalyst in bringing
                    people together.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. They also met other Africans from other countries in

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh no, I didn't mean it that way; I meant that when I went on
                    my FSN orientation program in 1979 I was on the same program as Deva and Ron
                    Hendrickse and it was for all cultural assistants across Africa. They were a
                    group of about 30 and I was the only white and the rest made it very difficult
                    for Deva and Ron because the rest of the group were very unhappy that I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Because I was white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may seem obvious but-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, because I was white. I mean, the guy from Kano, Nigeria,
                    big, big man, said if my government had known you were going to be here I
                    wouldn't have been allowed to come. And the lady from Liberia, with her Diane
                    von Furstenberg luggage, said to me, tell me- Ron and I had been in Miami for
                    three days beforehand and I'd had my hair permed and curly and I'd been in the
                    sun so I was quite brown, probably browner than Ron, and she asked me was I
                    classified colored, and I said I was very sorry to tell her but I was classified
                    white. And so they really resented me at first but by the end of the trip they
                    were quite good about saying, oh- the same Kano man patted me on my head and
                    told me I was a good woman. And Gilbert from Togo said he was going to take me
                    home to be his South African souvenir.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or spies or what have you and they had to prove at a very
                        early stage that they were not in order for there even to be the
                        possibility- It was quite tense, quite tense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I know that, and I'll tell you this, let me tell you another
                    little issue. There was a time during the Carter era that the South African
                    government introduced the homeland situation, Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu, etc.
                    And then they would enforce, nine times out of ten, they would insist that
                    anybody, if we invited them- I have to- No. Let me back track also.</p>
                <p>I have to tell you that, and I found that quite interesting when I listened to my
                    counterparts in other countries; the South African government never dictated to
                    us who we had to invite.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Unlike in many of the other countries where you had to go
                    through the ministry of this, that and the other, and there was quite a bit of
                    nepotism in that, this is what I heard from my own colleagues over there, the
                    South African government never did but on the other hand they had control by
                    denying an invitee a passport, so that was the way. Then, when the homeland came
                    into being they insisted that people travel on homeland passports and many-
                    several blacks refused to travel on these dummy passports while there were
                    others and let me, if I can quote you one, Sej Motau, who coincidentally is now
                    standing as a DA (Democratic Alliance) candidate in Pretoria—I can't believe it.
                    He went on OCA and he also went and did a Masters in journalism at Berkeley. He
                    was a senior journalist on the “Pretoria News” and he occupied big positions
                    with DeBeers in Canada and London; everything. He was the- But when we invited
                    him for the first time on OCA he was told that he could only have homelands,
                    Bophuthatswana passport.</p>

                    the mutual exchange of ideas and that, so they were going to influence Americans

                        think that this mutual understanding aspect has taken a secondary place in
                        our exchanges. Share with us your feeling of the importance of mutual. I
                        mean, it's a leading question because I'm in favor of it and now that we're
                        sending text messages out and all forms of electronic communication for
                        which there's no real face to face feedback, do you have any reflections on
                        this notion of mutual understanding? Because it's important to me I'm asking
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I used to think also that America was so vast a place, with
                    every kind of opportunity there and every conviction, that you could send
                    people, and I mentioned earlier we didn't only send those who liked us; we also
                    sent those who didn't, people like Adrian FlVak and Jimmy Krueger but if a
                    person had a really narrow mind there was enough going on in America that was
                    disappointing that they would find it and if they wanted to they could come back
                    saying oh, you see, it's exactly the same over there. But most times, I think,
                    that people's persuasions were changed. I really do think. If not immediately
                    but I think that it impacted on people, that they were able to see that there
                    was a different way to do this.</p>

                        say some people had their prejudices and their stereotypes confirmed, others
                        found some surprises. Would you recommend this to any large country, to have

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, ah. Okay, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: That opened many doors if I started a conversation with, hello,
                    I'm Gill Jacot Guillarmod from the American embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Now, so you mentioned this visit of Henry
                        Ollendorff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the occasion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: To, I think, because CIP had been in existence for quite awhile
                    and they wanted to have- It could have been the tenth anniversary or something
                    that we had it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you said phenomenal, wonderful; four month
                        internships, host families.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And I think why it was so amazing was because in those days,
                    particularly I'm talking about the black social worker, they weren't just social
                    workers; they were every single- they occupied every single position in the
                    townships that they could. They were fundraisers; they were guidance counselors;
                    they were parents in- what's that expression?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mentors. In loco parentis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: In loco parentis. Yes. They really- And their doors were open
                    24 hours a day to people and so that was wonderful, to be able to give people
                    like that an opportunity to go and- Because they were trained at Fort Hare;
                    that's where the only sort of black school of social work was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Now, on selection, did they send out people the way
                        OCA did or did you select them? The people-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, we would select them.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fort Hare, Eastern Cape, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Fort Hare, on the Eastern Cape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Easter Cape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay. Again, I don't know if it's all that important to remember the individual
                    names but generically what's your sense of how this transformed people, to go
                    off from a township, be in a city in the U.S. for months and to come back.</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I was able to- that's one of the reasons that the job was so
                    meaningful to me, because I was able to witness people return with a greater
                    sense of their own self worth. And I can remember after an OCA- a woman who went
                    on the OCA program, we had- there was a lady by the name of Dorothy, she was the
                    counsel, chairperson of the African- the American Council of Negro Women, I
                    think. Dorothy something. And we had, in our funny little- this is when the
                    embassy was still downtown, not in its great big luxury building now, we had a
                    multipurpose room, which had all sorts of wonderful things there. But we had a
                    group of women come together, talking, and Miss Dorothy was the keynote address
                    and she was, to be honest she was no great shakes but she was the most marvelous
                    catalyst at bringing all these women together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an American who had traveled-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: An African American woman who came, she was our guest-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a speaker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. Because don't forget, I didn't do only the outgoing
                    exchanges, I did all the incoming exchanges as well, in those days, which is
                    wonderful because I could get the two to mesh together. You'd meet somebody and
                    then send them on exchange program then you could program with them again when
                    they came back; it worked so well. But I can remember that particular day, and I
                    can't think what the topic was that she spoke about and- but I can remember an
                    African woman getting up and a white woman had spoken in a rather patronizing
                    way and the black woman got up and said, you know, don't you tell me that. And
                    she just spoke- and I was so proud of her, she was just really-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, you think, partly because of her trip to the
                        U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I'm pretty sure. I mean, it happened just two months
                    afterwards. I don't think she would have had the, well, not the courage but-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The gumption.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, gumption, probably a good word, you know, to have done. So
                    yes, we certainly did see people come back-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what you remember of the value of CIP was it increased
                        people's self confidence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, but she, don't forget the lady that I'm talking about-
                    Joyce was a grantee of OCA; I'm saying that all our exchange programs did that;
                    they enabled people to get a sense of their own self worth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very important. So that's something you could say
                        generically for all the exchanges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Absolutely, absolutely, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go to Fulbrights, other comments, other
                        recollections of the short-term visits? There were Humphreys-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, don't forget, you know, CIP closed and then we had
                    another- we had the Indiana- the South African internship program but that was-
                    I don't know what period you're covering.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: What, up until I left?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when CIP was put to rest; it would have been in
                        '93 or '94 and bureaucrats- because I was there at that time- bureaucrats-
                        the comment was we've supported them all of this years, let's give someone
                        else a chance. That was the argument; I was in the room. A truly idiotic
                        decision.</hi>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And how. And how, because they did wonderful work. I happened
                    to be at a CIP conference in Cleveland and I was flying from Cleveland to San
                    Francisco when P.W. Botha made his Cross the Rubicon speech and the South
                    African exchange rate, the rand plummeted, never to return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please explain this speech, “Cross the Rubicon.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Everybody was expecting him to make- to say some nice
                    enlightened remarks and he didn't, he just said nobody's going to dictate to us;
                    we'll do whatever we want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in the U.S. at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I was in the U.S., yes. With all the CIP grantees who happened
                    to be there. It was '85 and I was on the senior FSN program that I went- I was
                    based in Washington for three months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did it feel as if on a micro level things were
                        advancing very nicely partly because of your programs and on the macro level
                        it sounds as if you were frustrated with the slow-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Very, yes, very frustrated. Because strange things were
                    happening. Because, I mean, during that time also they changed the laws about
                    the group areas act, the passports. And I can remember seeing Sheena Duncan,
                    whom I mentioned earlier, who was the head of the Black Sash, I can remember
                    seeing her being interviewed on CNN and her eyes just filled with tears. She
                    said well if it is true it's the most marvelous news. And it was true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sorry; if what was true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: If it was true that people were no longer going to have to- the
                    group areas-</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>

                <p>Some of the readers of this are not familiar with Black Sash. Could you explain
                    Black Sash?</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: It was an organization founded by a bunch of women at the time
                    when the South African government was about to remove the colored, the so-called
                    colored people from the voter's roll and these women got up to protest and they
                    formed the group and they stood- they chained themselves to the fences of the
                    houses of parliament and they wore a black sash to show this sort of, this in
                    mourning sign and that's how they got their name. And then they continued; they
                    had branches around the country and they had advice officers, where people
                    would- their members would volunteer their services and people would come in and
                    it was usually for areas, things like people having been evicted because they
                    weren't a with pass for the Group Areas Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, I think, my understanding is that members of Black
                        Sash had a certain social prestige because of who they were. I think. Or was
                        it people of all the groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I just think that you- black people, the black people were
                    perhaps a little- appreciative of what the Black Sash were trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Helen Suzman at all connected with- she was a member
                        of parliament at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I don't- She was a member of parliament in the Cape. No, I
                    don't ever remember Helen as being- because I was a member of Black Sash in
                    Pretoria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say they chained themselves in Cape Town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, to parliament one day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember which- what did people do in Pretoria in
                        Black Sash?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: We did quite a few things. We would- when, in '87 when they
                    banned all the- “The Mail” and “Guardian” and the other newspapers and that, we
                    held demonstrations in the streets and that. But the most helpful thing that we
                    did, I think was, running this advice office, where we would take and then we
                    would get lawyers to work pro bono and assist people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this obviously was extracurricular to your position at

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the embassy, I think, was dealing with laws and
                        practices that the embassy did not agree with. For example, refusing to get

                    heaven a long time ago. And in initial years there were two, three, four people
                    a year. When I started off in '73 there were five that year and then five and
                    four and then they started, every now and again there would be extra- we'd get
                    extra money for a special program and the numbers would then be increased.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Each little drop; each person has a multiplier affect and each
                    person reaches somebody else and goes on with the group and they're an
                    inspiration to the people in the community with them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that some of the visitors, or most of them in

                        appearances that may have alluded to their visits directly or
                        indirectly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Very often they would- most people would give great credit to
                    their American experience. And you'd get some who didn't want to share, who
                    didn't want to- another companion. Don't forget, people who have been deprived
                    of so much for so long are going to also want to keep things to themselves so
                    they perhaps wouldn't be so good about recommending other able candidates.</p>

                        recollections of the individual program- well, and group, group program,
                        because sometimes you would send small groups that would be- become part of
                        larger groups, the single country programs, you would collect three, four,
                        five, six South Africans, send them together perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. I think something that's important to say is when I was
                    first started being involved with the IV program, just about everybody went on
                    an individual grant and South Africans weren't sent on group, multi regional
                    group projects or regional group projects because having a South African in the
                    group, no matter what his or her color was, was like a lightening rod and the
                    whole group would then only want to talk about what was happening in South
                    Africa. And I think they found it disruptive and they didn't- and gradually they
                    started to go more and more into group projects until now I think the majority
                    probably are on group program- even in my last years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Because it was also, I mean, it was- on a group program you've
                    got access- a high powered person is far more likely to make him or herself
                    available for an hour or two to meet with a group of 10 or five or 20 than they
                    are for just one little individual.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Okay, so until the social change took place in South Africa it was just difficult
                    for many reasons and to mix any type of South Africans-</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I mean, they did go; they did go on group programs but really-
                    And we also then would occasionally have single country projects but for the
                    most part people were on individual programs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the themes of the single country

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Going to looking at my records and that, in 1988 there were 47
                    people went on the IV program and those numbers there, 1989, large, the budget
                    was very, very large.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, I think also- I think we were quite on the ball. We would
                    always send a number of alternates and then towards the end of the year, when
                    other posts hadn't used up their funds, we had the people there already, the
                    application was in, the person was able to go.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, I think probably.</p>

                    different groups. We sent people from the Institute for Multi Party Democracy;
                    there'd be a group from there. We'd send people from [inaudible, Safety and
                    Security provincial legislature group. We sent a group that- of eight military
                    folk, four from the South African, four from the South African military and four

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: It was Jerry Kenner, and who was the econ officer who

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: But now that- Accord was founded- one of my Fulbrighters was
                    the founder of ACCORD and he came back. He went in about '85, I think.</p>

                    a lot of students and they came from far and wide, the students. You may have
                    about 20 odd coming for lunch and brunch; one time was brunch and one time was
                    lunch. It was wonderful.</p>

                    I was- I had seen them when they applied to go on their Fulbright application.
                    I'd seen them at the pre-departure orientation program and now I can see them in
                    situ, you know, doing what we'd sent them to do.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: When they came back, yes. And I mean, we had- that was the
                    wonderful thing about it; we've had very- the attrition rate's not been bad at
                    all. They really have- they've all come, for the most part they come back.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, you could justify anything because it was going to be- the
                    black student was going to be a role model so it didn't matter, even if it was
                    areas that perhaps weren't of a high priority, like business, an MBA or so, but
                    this was going to be the first person in the whole of South Africa who, you

                    because he kept- we had already made our selections for the year and he came in
                    to see me absolutely desperate. Reverend Buti from Alexandria had made him a
                    promise that he was going to get him a scholarship and he got his admission to
                    Wisconsin and everything and then Reverend Buti let him down. And here was this

                    I was able to- I was so touched and the man impressed me so that I was able to
                    persuade, and I can't now remember how we got the money, where we did, but we
                    were able to get- I think there was extra money in Jackie Cotton's shop in ECA,

                    the panel that was chosen became black. We had, in South Africa, a category that
                    I don't think any other country had; we called it placement only, and we would
                    send vast numbers of South- my own, the man who got me to the center, Christof
                    Heyns, was a placement only. You didn't give them any money but we would
                    facilitate. They would go through the whole process and I used to say to them,
                    you're perfectly entitled to put Fulbright scholar on your application, even
                    though you didn't get any money from us, because you went through. We paid for
                    them to do the GRE and the TOEFL and we paid their, you know, their entrance
                    fees, etc., and the IIE treated them just as though they were a funded
                    scholar.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: They were always so stellar that the universities either-
                    either they had their own wherewithal or else the universities gave them such
                    general fellowships, like Christof who got a full tuition waiver from Yale.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh. Because he was an IV; he was an IV and I'd worked with him,
                    he and his wife. Christof's father was the moderator of the NHK (Nederduitsch
                    Hervormde Kerk van Afrika), which is the Afrikaans- the Dutch Reform Church, and
                    most of the government people were members of the Dutch Reform Church. And he
                    was regarded as very enlightened for his position; he saw the error, I think, of
                    the policies that the country was following and he clearly was too moderate for
                    some because one night, when playing cards with his children, his grandchildren,
                    he was shot by an unknown assassin, shot in the head, died; the assassin has
                    never been found. This was in 1994-95.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Pretty much First and Third World.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, after you think about it, in First, if you think that the
                    first heart transplant took place in this country and we have Nobel Peace Prize
                    winners, we've had Nobel literature winners and in scientific strides we've done
                    a great deal, where some of our universities are competitive around the world.
                    But on the other hand you have a huge- we've got the greatest, and I never know
                    what this expression is, the greatest discrepancy between the rich and the poor.
                    There's an expression one uses for that.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: The gap between rich and poor, I think it's greater in South
                    Africa than anywhere else in the world. And we have- we've got a huge
                    unemployment rate, we have vast illiteracy rate, a lot of people homeless, many,
                    many people- so very much-</p>

                        of the last 10 years, we'll skip ahead for a moment, the whole country
                        trying to grapple with this discrepancy, First World, Third World; how has
                        this been working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, you know, you can read in the press and that; I mean, I
                    think so much has happened and nobody would go back to the old days at all.
                    There's so much- more people have access to water, more people have access to
                    electricity, more people have access to free health, to education, but- and
                    there's been an extraordinary amount of black wealth as well. But complaint
                    seems to be that it really has selected to a few; there are a few black
                    billionaires now and there's an awful lot of people whose situation hasn't
                    changed.</p>

                    you went to our campus. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fantastic. Now, so there are examples that you can point
                        to where there's been great material progress. Are you saying that this is
                        not enough, the norm; it's more the exception than the norm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, no, no. I think that it is, but I think also a whole lot of
                    the people who occupy public- who are in the public service - haven't had the
                    training and so a lot of the money isn't well spent and sadly, there has been a
                    lot of corruption, we've got the best finance minister in the world, Trevor
                    Manuel, we certainly do have. We've been shielded from the economic recession by
                    the policies that he put in place, he and Mbeki, because, I mean, without
                    Mbeki's approval he wouldn't have been able to apply those policies. I don't
                    know how long we're going to remain protected from the globe-</p>

                    reputed to be one of the best departments in the country. At the end of the year
                    the “Mail” and “Guardian” always does a rating; you know, they give a report
                    card for all the ministers, etc., and Trevor Manuel always gets an A.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, he did go on- Those tended to be shorter, more
                        focused.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Very short lived, for about a week or ten days and focusing on
                    a specific area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you said a minute ago, back to the training. Those
                        who were fortunate to benefit from our exchange programs had some training
                        or had some exposure.</hi>

                        feel that there were enough people to make this happen, within the embassy?
                        There was a lot of work. You, Gill Jacot Guillarmod, were often at that
                        office until 7:00, 8:00 at night.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes, yes. So nobody made me, nobody stood with a gun at my
                    head, I did it and every moment gave me great, great joy. But I did feel
                    troubled when, for no reason, I mean, why did they take away the money for the
                    South African internship program? I used to think of it as a wonderful thing
                    because we only touched on that briefly. That was based on the same program
                    that- the same format that CIP had followed, we would send people to the States
                    for two months, a two month program, live with American families and work under
                    the guidance of a mentor. It didn't have to have a tertiary qualification to get
                    it; you could be working in the driving- the drivers license thing.</p>
                <p>I used to think of the Fulbright program as the American Government's long-term
                    fix for South Africa and the internship program as our short-term fix, because
                    you'd have somebody who perhaps worked in a drug and rehab- drug counseling
                    section, as I said in the licensing department, somebody else in the social work
                    department, other people in business; all sorts of areas, some on university
                    campuses, depending on the particular area, and they'd have these two months and
                    come back and it'd just give them a crash course in whatever it is they were
                    doing. And then they'd- It was one of the reasons I left, was because I'd heard,
                    the day that Christof phoned to ask me to come and join I had two- I'd had the
                    last two days and when I'd come home and said what difference am I making to
                    anybody else's life.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes. But it seems to be a lot better now and I've talked
                    to my colleagues, Tashina and Irene and all of them, they've introduced a whole

                        had to make a lot of progress in a very short period of time. It did not do

                        that in parliaments legislators and members of parliament justify the use of
                        money to develop these programs by saying this will create a market. Where's
                        this going now? Trevor Manuel has his hands full, doesn't he? And this

                    want to put money into other countries, no matter how deserving they might be? I

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I think it must be harder to work with USIS now than it was

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, I think because of that good guy/bad guy thing, because
                    now, just because we have a democratically elected government in power doesn't
                    mean to say that they're doing everything that's right.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I just think it was so easy to say, because you wanted to put

                        and any aspect of it, the sense of- the social dimensions, the political,
                        whatever; '70s and '80s and then major change in the '90s. Before we leave
                        the '70s and '80s, tell me your sense of the contrast. You've made some
                        comments about it was horrible in the Cape and there were difficulties in
                        dealing with the regime.</hi>

                    Guillarmod, and I'm going to be- I'd like a table for six for lunch; these two
                    of my guests will be black. I had to get permission to do that. That wasn't

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: From the restaurant; the restaurant had to say yes. And you

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seventies and '80s. Now, could you have phoned up and said
                        this is Gill Jacot Guillarmod, I'm bringing six visitors? Could you do
                        that?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, absolutely, yes.</p>

                        you had to do all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, always, always. We did different things, like, even in
                    Jerry's day we had- we took a black cellist and a white pianist, or was it the
                    other way around? And we went to- a hotel had just opened and we collaborated
                    with “The Pretoria News” and we had a concert that people- there was no charge
                    but you- there was a hat and you could give a donation to read- to LEARN, Let
                    Every African Read Now, it was a program that “The Pretoria News” was having. So
                    we did that and we didn't get permission for it- we didn't get any government
                    or- permission for that but it was a very nice social occasion. And don't
                    forget, you would have heard about- they didn't go on exchange, well, not many
                    of them went on exchange programs but one of the things that the American
                    embassy did was wonderful; we had the Pretoria Music Appreciation Society and we
                    used to meet in that funny little multipurpose room downtown and have- and
                    [inaudible], who was an OCAer, also in heaven now; he was one of Bart's driving
                    forces; he went in '75. He was wonderful at- did a great deal to promote the

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Music was music. And jazz, we promoted jazz. And then we would
                    have movies; we'd get- just because, don't forget black, there weren't bioscopes
                    or cinemas for black people or anything; we would get- have movies from the
                    States and then have everybody come and you had blacks and white South
                    Africans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I did all the exchanges, all the outgoing and for awhile I did
                    the incoming also, and I did- Then as we grew we then had a cultural section; we
                    had people like Sheila, you know, who did the- who dealt with- But in the

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. When I was in Cape Town the guy from the South African
                    information service came over to see me one day and asked me wouldn't I come
                    and- I was single- wouldn't I come and work for them. And I smiled and I said
                    you know, that's really very tempting because South Africa can only really go to
                    nice countries, I know that. I said but if you are asking me to sell Pepsi Cola
                    and I really liked Coca Cola then I might be able to do it. But you're going to
                    ask me to do something that I really wouldn't want to sell. And he still
                    continued to come and visit.</p>

                <p>Now, working in-between two countries, one of them, there was a certain

                    this personally?</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I used to get my “we” and “they” mixed up.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. Happened to be [inaudible]. He said my God; he said you've

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, very often it was America. It was America. But don't forget
                    I watched- I saw a lot of changes, you know. I went through the time during the
                    Carter Administration; the South African government wanted nothing to do with
                    us. They avoided coming to Fourth of July functions, etc., for the most part.
                    And then Ronald Reagan came in and with it the constructive engagement policy,
                    which saw a reversal of those of us who liked us and those who didn't. But we
                    continued to invite South Africans of all colors and political persuasions and
                    actually as- though many blacks spoke out vehemently against the capitalist
                    supporters of apartheid, when there were- as I said to you, when they were
                    actually presented with the letter then they were able to accommodate their
                    principles.</p>
                <p>Q; Are you suggesting that constructive engagement, Chet Crocker, under Reagan,
                    actually created a friendly- a greater friendship with the apartheid regime and
                    a greater alienation of the majority population?</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, I do think that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well you know, I think maybe it wasn't such a bad idea to try
                    it because we achieved absolutely nothing under the previous administration and
                    in fact it was becoming harder and harder, you know, to- I can't say more and
                    more people were denied passports, I can't really say that but I think it was
                    difficult to- I can remember- I struck up a relationship with a guy in the
                    passport office and so- and I would phone him and then say oh come on, won't you
                    tell me, is he going to get this? Just tell me; is he going to get the passport
                    or isn't he? Because if he's not then we go- at least we know. But if you think
                    he's going to get it even at the last minute I can be planning for his trip. And
                    then one day when I phoned him he said, Gill, I'm sorry but I've been told I'm
                    not allowed to give you any information.</p>

                        anyway nobody doubts that that's what he intended to do. Jimmy Carter was
                        more popular with the apartheid regime than Ronald Reagan. I'm sorry, is it

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh, I don't know. I mean, I bump into people now who went 20
                    years ago and say oh, you've no idea what that did for me, that program. Dikgang
                    Moseneke, who is the deputy chief justice of the constitutional court, he was-
                    we had our moot court competition here in South Africa last year because it was
                    the University of Pretoria's centenary, we had it here, and I had a dinner at
                    the Pretoria Country Club for all our final- We have a very prestigious bunch of
                    international jurists serve on the final panel and I had a dinner at the
                    Pretoria Country Club and Dikgang arrived early and he was with my boss and
                    normally assistant director, and was very, very proud the way he said you have
                    no idea what this lady did for me, how she- You know, he made it [inaudible]; he
                    was exaggerating.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: But he said to them, telling them about my previous life, how I
                    had- he made it sound as though I'd held his hand all the way around the United
                    States. But he said you don't know what- he said that was such a wonderful
                    program.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the other people in the room understand what that was

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: At this stage it was before the others; it was just my two

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes, yes; okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: So that was good for me, that he was saying that, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was an institution-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And he said it when I had to take a group in 2005, when we had
                    to move to Port- in Johannesburg. I took all the judges to the consulate, the
                    chief justice hosted them, all those visitors, and it was the same thing;
                    Dikgang- to all of them and to all his colleagues. He was a Robben Island
                    “graduate.”</p>
                <p>So you know, they do, they remember their experiences.Q: So the people remember
                    the program but they also remember you as the personal contact. You said so; you
                    said so. You personalized it.</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The program was you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I was just- I was really lucky. I was able to be Lady
                    Bountiful. You know, I mean, it was me in particular, I think even more so with
                    the Fulbright program than of any of the other programs, because with the IVs,
                    CIP, etc., the branches connected more with the grantees. With Fulbright once
                    they had gone through the interview, came to Pretoria, I dealt with them
                    directly until it was time for them to be going. I would be the one who would
                    phone them that- And I had a policy that I wouldn't go home at night until I
                    had- If an admission offer had come through I wouldn't- even if it came through
                    at 9:00 as I was going out the door, then I wouldn't go out the door because
                    then I'd stay and let the student- person know, because I knew how- and I would
                    be as excited as they, you know, to say, how does University of Los Angeles
                    sound? You know? So, it was lovely, wonderful.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh, no, no; Monica Joyi, who took over from me at the Fulbright

                    think she heard- she would meet with alumni who would say oh, where's Gill? I
                    think particularly with the Fulbrighters, you know, because you really have a
                    chance to change their lives. They've gone over and they've been there for two
                    years, and when they worked with you closely it did seem as though it was me and
                    I'd always say but it wasn't me; it was the U.S. Government money and it was
                    you; you because of your talent and your skills and your brains and everything,
                    you know. But- and then Monica was very, very, good and she'd always, she'd
                    phone- invited me to participate in the selection. I must say they- I continued

                    wonderful. On the other hand, in my speech at Tom Hall's party, I said that, you

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. It's always so nice when I see him. He's a true gentleman.
                    I just remember that. There are a few who I do remember, you know.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He's also been a visiting professor at NYU (New York
                    University), I think, or Columbia, one of the two. I think NYU, he and his nice

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And he still is very involved in ORT, the Jewish charity. I

                        could have come.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Something went wrong with the invitations. I was unhappy
                    because on my first day here I wasn't too sure where to park and I was walking
                    across the campus and I bumped into two people who said what are you doing here?
                    And I said well I'm working here, you know that. I mean, you couldn't come to my
                    farewell. They said we didn't know anything about it. So I don't know what
                    happened with that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I don't know. But- no, it was wonderful. And Tom was very
                    supportive because you know; I agonized for four months before I decided to
                    accept the offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a person who's taken personally so much, a working
                        position, does not leave it lightly. But you say the reduction in resources
                        was one factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: A huge factor, huge. Because the Fulbright was now with the
                    Fulbright Commission; I wasn't doing the Fulbright anymore. And then- I mean, I
                    sent 60 odd a year on the internship program so that was very time consuming and
                    that was going to be going, leaving me, and I just didn't know what else. And
                    when I eventually went to speak to Tom [Hull, PAO] he said I've watched the
                    diminishing of your position with concern and he said I wondered what you were
                    going to do. And he said to be honest I think- He said I don't know that I would
                    have said this if this was the start of my tour, but he said seeing how I'm
                    leaving I think if you are going to go anywhere I think you could go to no finer
                    place than the Center for Human Rights and work for anybody less, you know, of a
                    person than Christof Heyns.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, he left in- he left after me, he left after me because he
                    was again, at the party, he left in about August/September. Look here, I just
                    got the invitation to his daughter's wedding.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Where he was DCM. And then he went as ambassador to Sierra
                    Leone and he hosted my LMN students on two occasions to- he got all the embassy,
                    his political officers and everything, my group of students. We send them as
                    part of the program they go on a field trip, they break up into groups and they
                    are going to go to other places now but they went to Sierra Leone, Rwanda and

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes. And also in Rwanda because Brian George was there and
                    then Jerry Keener was there also. So I keep looking to see where are they going
                    next, where have a got a contact, you know. And of course Tom and I worked
                    together in '79 when he was ACA, that's where- I mean, his daughter was born

                    memory and his notes are terrific, I can tell you. And have you spoken to
                    Brooks, Brooks Spector? Because I promise you you'll get more from Brooks than

                    night, ask me to show you; they did a book and people who were there wrote
                    messages in it and it's really- it's very nice and Gaby wrote and he said, you
                    know, you took me, a jailbird, to be- those days. And I kept his passport for

                    Brooks spoke and he told me who all was there and I just wanted to die that I

                    when I was- took a cab, I was going, actually going to John Hicks's place for
                    dinner and a huge, big guy from Sierra Leone and he told me, I mean I asked and

                    couldn't wait to get his degree so that he could get back home so that he could

                    and [Ambassador] Bill Swing were just the right people to be together because
                    Bill Swing wanted to meet with everybody. We had Paul Simon; we had Whoopi
                    Goldberg; we had them all at the residence. We did the whole cast of “Ain't
                    Misbehaving” do a performance. Abdullah Ibrahim play and all Brooks responsible,
                    all in the results.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And then Brooks and I together, we organized what I think was
                    the best thing the embassy ever did and everybody around said it was also. When
                    Brooks came to me he came and he said- he came back as cultural attach�. We had
                    worked together in '76 when he was ABPAO in Johannesburg, and we worked well
                    together on the exchanges program. And when he came again, had been PAO in
                    Swaziland and then came to be cultural attach�, and he said to me, what can we
                    do to- and he was always looking for something new to do. And I said you know,
                    we haven't done anything with the grantees; we really haven't done with them.
                    We've got a brand new ambassador; why don't we start- We brainstormed, between
                    the two of us, and we triggered a-</p>
                <p>We ended up having a dinner at the Carlton Hotel and we had entertainment and we
                    used former- people who had been on our exchange programs; we got them to do it.
                    Siho Mpamle, now in heaven, read his poetry. Mary Jane Mohodiela told a story
                    that she rambled on, unfortunately. Christof's father gave the- said the grace
                    at the dinner. We- let me just think who else. Well, we ended with- We had Sean
                    Reddy played the piano and we ended with Evita, who ended up with singing, “Free
                    start and God bless America.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a certain individual depicting Evita

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, it was Pieter-Dirk Uys.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was an IV?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: He was an IV; that's why I asked him. He went on the Iowa
                    writers program, and he cut the program short and I was at a show- a perform-
                    one of his performances afterwards and he said being in Iowa was like being in
                    Vrystaad. And “Vrystaad, I was born in Vrystaad.” I found it particularly
                    funny.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>No, but we had- I mean, there were a few hundred people there; everybody. It
                    really was. We had everybody who'd been in the '80s and then Swing was so taken
                    up with it, we had table of 10, yes, 10 at a table, and there was one of us,
                    somebody from the embassy, an officer or something, and he hosted each table.
                    And Swing, so taken up, he said he wanted to do it in Cape Town also. So we did
                    it in Cape Town and there we did everybody from the '70s and the '80s. And I
                    can't remember whether F.W. came; I can't- Frank would be able to tell you that.
                    And then they wanted to do it- He said that was so- And we had David Kramer, who
                    was- Eva Kramer and [inaudible] Peterson who- but David Kramer he said- We did
                    this- followed the same format, you know, poetry, reading, music, etc., all
                    donated. And then- well then we did in Durban and we did with everybody who'd
                    ever been on an exchange program and so Brooks and I went to Cape Town and we
                    went to Durban and that also- And I think that was really the things that we did
                    and then Brooks doing the- was the best thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was something you and Brooks thought up
                        together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: We did together, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was what? There's now an active alumni program
                        which does- tries to do this systematically but I think it was-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: But it was not, no, was nothing. I think that what they should
                    have done at the embassy, and I suggested it but nobody took me up on it, last
                    year, when it was the University of Pretoria's centenary, I think they should
                    have done a University of Pretoria alumni thing because there's- I could that
                    you wouldn't do it 10, 15 years ago when this was such a conservative place but
                    it's not like that anymore. It's the most progressive university in the
                    country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did it become progressive? Because it was in the '80s
                        it was thought of as very conservative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: In about- I can remember in about '94, I was at a function at,
                    maybe a little bit later, '96 maybe, at something at the PAO residence and the
                    former principle, Johann Van Zyl, a very charismatic, dynamic guy, and he was
                    there and I'd had a couple of glasses of wine and was in my cups myself, and I
                    said to him, you know, if anybody had ever asked me which would be the very last
                    campus to transform I would have had no hesitation in saying this, and I said
                    but it's such a pleasure to be able to say to you, you know, how good it is to
                    have you-</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Except, don't forget, this place, the Center for Human Rights,
                    was established here in 1986 in the heart of- when it was at its most
                    conservative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because much was said about Wits [University of

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No. And also, don't forget, they never- there was less need for
                    transformation from UCT and Wits, etc. This was a bastion. I couldn't bring Mary
                    J. Barnett, the black belly dancer here because she was- they didn't want to

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I'm pretty sure that it; let me just look. I went to a

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Bishop Tutu came to this campus?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: One of my favorite things was, and whenever I was asked to make
                    a presentation on the Fulbright program, and I did that to all the people who
                    were then on the committee before the Fulbright Commission was established, they
                    came out from Washington and everything and I went to Cape Town to do that. And
                    then I said, you know, I gave them all the statistics and I said, can I just
                    give a little bit of a personal thing about why I think this is such a wonderful
                    program. And I told them about- I said, you know, there have been so many
                    magnificent Fulbrighters that one or two stand out in my mind, never to be
                    forgotten. And I always tell the story of Johnny Mekwa, the trumpeter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And I went- You remember that, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And I'm sure you know, I've told you this story also then so-
                    We interviewed him in Durban and he was a late student. He was the first black
                    student to do that- get a bachelor in jazz studies at the University of
                    KwaZulu-Natal under Darius Brubeck. And he started- His uncle was the embassy
                    DCM's driver, Johannes Mekwa; and that's just coincidental.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>And he graduated- got his bachelor when he was over 40. And we asked him, as we
                    do everybody, you know, why should we send you, why do you want to go? And he
                    said because I want to go and I want to learn things that will help me to come
                    back and get my kids off the street. And he went to Indiana and he was very
                    successful. He got his Master his jazz studies in two years, made all sorts of
                    connections in the music world in America, and he came back, and he hadn't been
                    back weeks and he went to the Daveyton, the Daveyton township there. And he went
                    to the city council and he talked them into giving him a building, an unused
                    building, and then he went to knocking on the corporate doors and he's very
                    persuasive. He's a huge man; he's a huge man. I worry about him desperately for
                    heart attack material.</p>
                <p>And he went knocking on doors and Rick Menal, he always talks about Rick from, I
                    think, either Anglo or De Beers, one of them, got generous money from him and
                    all sort of other people got funding and he went to other fellow musicians to
                    get them to agree to give up their time to give classes and then he went into
                    the streets and he got his pupils. And they came from the streets and 18 months
                    later they won the jazz competition in Chicago. And then he got here, about
                    three years ago, the University of Pretoria ordered him an honorary doctorate
                    and I was sitting in the third row as his guest. I remember him phoning me and
                    he said, oh Gill, hey Gill, I'm telling you. And then he said and I'm going to
                    get my ringgo now. I said good, Johnny, it's going to be a hell of a lot of red
                    material.</p>
                <p>And a year and a half after we did UNISA (University of South Africa) did exactly
                    the same thing. But in his remarks, and he dedicated his award- he broke down
                    crying and couldn't finish- but he dedicated it to John Burns, was one of the
                    people, to Rick Menal and to many of his other musicians who had gone before.
                    Obviously just when he thought about them it just made him cry and he wept.
                    Isn't that a wonderful story? And then he got an honorary doctorate at UNISA and
                    he kindly - I was his guest there too. And I sat next, with Professor James
                    Khumalo, who's the person- who was an IV in '74 and he was the person who put
                    together our South Africa national anthem.</p>
                <p>So see, we've done things here in this- But he went- when Professor Khumalo went
                    in '74 it was on a very strange program; it was a program we sent three Zulu
                    students to the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale to teach- while
                    they were studying they were teaching Zulu to the American students, and
                    Professor Khumalo was- I think he ended up as a lecturer but he was their sort
                    of warden, going with them. But he then also- His claim to fame now is that he
                    wrote- he's composed lots of wonderful music but I mean, he put together our
                    national anthem. You know, the combining of the two.</p>

                <p>Now, before we get to what you're doing presently, Gill, looking back at the

                    memory?</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Well, I was very proud of- that we sent Maki Mandela, who was
                    former President Mandela's daughter from his first marriage, and I happened to
                    be on my three month senior FSN program in '85 when she was there and I had a
                    photograph of she and I and Mickey Morgan, who's subsequently become a vice
                    chancellor himself. There were three of us; photograph taken in the grounds of
                    Gallaudet University-</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, school for the deaf, yes, and we were there on a program.
                    And I used to come back and then when things got really hot in South Africa I
                    would have this photograph and I used to say that- what I would say is if there
                    was a horde coming towards me, a marauding, people with sabers and things, I
                    would-</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: -this is me with Mandela's daughter. And she was very good; she
                    came to my farewell party, which was very nice of her.</p>
                <p>And my other only- I haven't met President Mandela, which is- that's my one- If I
                    could meet him then I could die happy. I haven't met him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could he be- how could he fail to seek you out? What's
                        his problem? Does he not understand what you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: But I did have when Ambassador Lyman was here, as he was
                    leaving he came to me and he said he wanted a favor, that President Mandela had
                    only made- had made three phone calls to him during his duration and two of them
                    had concerned a young man called Tanda Bantu Kwandawala, and he was a chief from
                    the area where President Mandela had grown up and he wanted him to get a post
                    graduate qualification and would I help. And I really thought, oh, this is my
                    chance to be doing something. And Tanda Bantu and I spoke often on the phone,
                    that I really bent all the rules because I rewrote his application. We put in
                    all- and we got two scholarships for him from Massachusetts, because he wasn't a
                    stellar student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Mandela's interest in this man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Because he was a chief from Mandela's part of the world and
                    Mandela wanted to build up his-</p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: For that part of the world. And then Tanda Bantu phoned me one
                    day and said no, that he couldn't go anymore, that his people, the chiefs around
                    were begging him to stay. And I- In those- Then- At that time I was in touch
                    with President Mandela's assistant, a lady who has since died, and I said to
                    her, you know, he's a man. We can't make him go if he wants- The only person who
                    might be able to persuade him is the president himself but obviously he
                    couldn't. But I got a very nice letter from him back, thanking me for that.</p>

                    Chief Bantu Holomisa, who's a former IV also and he's the head of- the chief of
                    the traditional leaders. He's a member of parliament and that also. And I asked
                    him, we were down on a program down on the Eastern Cape, and I asked him if he
                    knew Tanda Bantu and he said yes, he did and he would give him my regards
                    whenever he saw him.</p>

                        they were to the U.S. but it's clear that many of today's leaders in South

                    money, etc. We had several group programs where we sent people and if I go
                    through the list on that, I mean, there was one on constitutionalism, where the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Okay, well you've just given- of the many, many
                        programs you've done there's just one, the-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. There was another one on the demo- elections for the
                    democratic convention and Essop Pahad, who was in Mbeki's office who's now out
                    on his ear, he was one. He was with the South African communist party. He went
                    on that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the recent Democratic convention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh, no, no; also '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ninety-two.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Because that's what I'm saying. You know, they were all
                    identified then, in the '90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Others will come to mind and we can add that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, may I- I don't want to miss anything but can we talk about your present
                    position and how your knowledge and your experience from working in the embassy
                    serves the purpose of your present activities?</p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Sure. One of the- I'm quite sure the reason Christof asked me
                    to come and work here was because there was a function, and you might not need
                    this but just for your own edification, there was a function here, they gave-
                    the university faculty awarded their woman in law award to Frene Ginwala, who
                    was then the speaker of the house of assembly, and I was a guest. They're really
                    good about inviting me to different functions and I came quite often. And it was
                    a real who's who in the audience and most- I just seemed to know just about
                    everybody; I had a wonderful time.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>And now that I know Christof I could see the way he thinks, that he obviously
                    looked around and he thought, oh, she could be useful to us. Because I knew
                    people and they knew me so I was having loads of warm discussions and that. And
                    at 10:00 that night I got a phone call from him saying I've had a crazy idea;
                    wouldn't you like to come and work for us? And that was- I told you that I
                    hadn't- I said to him, normally- you know how much I love my job but I would
                    normally, you know, just say thank you but no thanks, but I said I've had two
                    days in a row when I thought what difference am I making and I said I believe in
                    coincidences; may I think about it? And I agonized for four months and I
                    eventually then decided- a lot of upset- I wrote to a few of my colleagues that
                    I had worked for, people who I thought would have USIS's interests and my
                    interests at heart and only one said don't go; Jody said don't go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lewinson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Jody Lewinson, yes. She said no, stay, stay where you are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Christof valued you so highly that he was willing to wait
                        four months to get an answer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, he created the job for me so there wasn't anybody here;
                    they created the position. And so I then did come and where I think it's been
                    helpful that- From the mid '80s we took a constant decision in- at USIA that we
                    looked at the statistics of the number of lawyers in the country and the
                    absolutely abysmal percentage of those who were black, and so we got special
                    money from Washington, Washington agreed to give us, in collaboration with
                    Georgetown University, and we had- for several years it was called the South
                    African Black Lawyers Program and we chose five or six and when Vasu Gounden was
                    speaking he went on that. And there are several people now so, but as a result I
                    ended up building up a large- a database of black lawyers because we had sent,
                    over the years we sent so- you know, we had sent so many. And I think that's
                    been very helpful. I know just about every judge on the constitutional court
                    now, has been on one of our exchange programs and I'm able to- I have to-
                    Sandile Ngcobo was a Fulbrighter. They don't all, to be honest. Some of them
                    remember we well; others were reminded, others are just being polite because for
                    them it was just an experience and maybe I didn't work with them all that
                    closely. But we remained in the embassy's- I kept in touch with the embassy
                    about the- with the Fulbright program and served on the interviewing committee
                    and on, a couple of years on the national selection committee. I've worked with
                    the cultural section to- when they have speakers who they want to bring up to
                    the University of Pretoria, sometimes even not in the field of law, I've worked
                    with the embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the collaboration between the embassy today
                        and what you're doing today in your capacity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. This professor that I- was chiding me because I haven't
                    responded to him. A professor- there's a Professor Anayin who is at Emory
                    University and he is an extraordinary professor here. Our budget is very
                    limited; we're dependent on donors for our existence. Just about all of us are
                    subcontracted employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Here at the Center, at the Center, yes. So for us to bring a
                    professor out from the States is money that we don't have but now that we have
                    the facility to make use of the embassy's facility for doing a digital video, so
                    that's what we're going to do. We're going to take our LLM students along next
                    Wednesday and Professor Anayin will deliver a lecture to them and then there
                    will be time for them to- for Q&amp;A (questions and answers) afterwards.</p>
                <p>

                        working with students, law students here-</hi>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And because you're so conversant with both sides of it
                        there's a dialogue that would not have happened but will between a professor
                        at Emory and a group of students here. What will the subject of the
                        discussion be?</hi>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Let me just look up and see. Islam and- while we're chatting
                    I'll look that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the topic of the digital videoconference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Will be Islam and human rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Islam and human rights. Is there an agenda that the Center
                        here has for this discussion? Is there an outcome that the Center wants or
                        is it a free open discussion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: No, I think they just always- It's a very intensive course,
                    this Masters in human rights and democratization and they try and touch on all
                    aspects. It concentrates on Africa but you know, Islam is very powerful in
                    Africa also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I mean, the title implies that somebody wants to have
                        a discussion about how Islam can be consonant-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -with human rights perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: I guess so; I'll tell you next Wednesday. I'll go with the
                    students, you know.</p>
                <p>I had just joined here when Christof told me that there was an American professor
                    that they were really hoping, they wished they could get over. And I worked with
                    Monica and with the Fulbright senior specialist program and we got a grant for a
                    Dr. David Padilla, who's the former executive secretary of the Organization of
                    American States. And he has since come- We actually- they, CIES gave him the
                    grant for the second time in a row and David is a wonderful person. We get him
                    for absolutely nothing. He keeps coming back. We pay for his air ticket and we
                    give him accommodation but we give him no honorarium and we don't pay for his
                    meals or anything and he keeps coming back. He's coming back again, he's
                    arriving on- this year, he's currently in La Paz, I got an email from him today.
                    And he and I went up to the gorillas with Brian. He was on a Fulbright grant in
                    Rwanda, which is why I- the timing, I went there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, just to make the link visible, this is your previous
                        career totally integrated into the current one.</hi>

                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, very much so. And now this- we have coming also, thanks to
                    the PAS [Public Affairs Section], we made an application for another professor
                    through the senior scholar program, senior specialist program but were- to my
                    utter amazement we were unsuccessful. I couldn't believe it. I didn't think
                    anybody did any work better than we did but when I spoke to the PAO, Mary Dean
                    [Connor], she was very kind, she said she hadn't known about it and then she and
                    the cultural attach� came here and they wanted some stuff from me also and
                    they'd given a grant; they've given him a grant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Local?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: A local grant to bring him out. So he's arriving on Sunday, the
                    22nd.</p>

                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: That's what the senior specialist program is; it's between two
                    and six weeks, they come for-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Window of opportunity to be with students here in

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: So it's really is- I love it when- I always say I love it when
                    my old life connects with my new. One of the people that- I hadn't been here
                    very long; Donna Rodzinsky was still CAO, and she asked me and we walked with
                    the Department of Business and Economic Sciences to bring out somebody who
                    subsequently became very famous. He was then the secretary, was Robert Zoellick,
                    and you know he's now head of the World Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my. You brought- oh my. USTR (United States Trade
                        Representative) and now World Bank. Wow. Did he come out as USTR? U.S. Trade
                        Representative?</hi>

                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes. And they said afterwards, and I think that- I believe the
                    embassy told me afterwards he said that his session here with the students, and
                    we brought in some students from the Mamelodi Campus as well, and he said that
                    it was the highlight of his trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow.</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: And he- I also worked with them- Because of my links with
                    Indiana University over the South African internship program and Patrick Amara,
                    who's the head of international affairs, a former South African of many, many
                    years with CIP and that as well, we- I worked with- The law faculty set up- had
                    a- State Department gave a grant to the law faculty and Indiana University and
                    Indiana brought out experts to deliver lectures on legislative drafting and then
                    took a bunch of South African magistrates over- or prosecutors, I think, over
                    for legislative drafting in the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tulane did that also. Tulane had a legislative drafting

                        Guillarmod, this is your life. And before we shut off the mic, the sense
                        that you've had of your- in the sweeping fate of things that have happened
                        in the last 20 years in this country and you've been right in the middle of
                        it; what does it feel like, what do you think you were able to accomplish
                        and what does it feel like when you look back at what you did during that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Oh, just a feeling of such gratitude, really, that I could have
                    been part of, really part of history, that I was able to- and I was so lucky
                    that I just landed in a job where I could help make opportunities and make it
                    possible for people, as I said early on, to realize their own sense, you know,
                    their own worth and that. And then, you know, come from there and to now, with a
                    continuation with the Human Rights because it really is an absolute follow on
                    from what we did at the embassy. And now I've gotten to travel throughout my
                    continent; I'm going to Nigeria in August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you used to be persona non grata and where you're
                        now very grata.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Gill, knowing that we'll add anything to this at any
                        time, I want to thank you for sharing these brief episodes in a remarkable
                        career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: Lovely; I've enjoyed it. I've enjoyed- I like looking down and
                    then when I- my eye falls upon somebody's name I think oh, yes, and it brings
                    back a memory, you know. There are so many wonderful, wonderful memories. Sadly
                    the more recent ones, I'm afraid, are not that good.</p>
                <p>We had, oh, just a lovely little story. Obed Magure was a blind man and we sent
                    him to Boston College where he did a Masters in educational-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JACOT GUILLARMOD: In education, yes. Well, he came back to South Africa and I
                    really- obviously I was at the airport to meet him and my friend, she then
                    became my friend, Serena, she was my counterpart at the IIE, Institute of
                    International Education, and she was very nice. She met Obed on arrival and put
                    him on the plane to Boston and everything and then when he came back he- I got a
                    phone call from him, he said he wanted to pay me a visit. And he came down;
                    obviously somebody brought him and then we had a lovely session in my office and
                    then he said oh Gill, I've got a few things for you in the car.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>So I went out to the car and they opened the boot, you'd say the trunk, and in it
                    was- he comes from- he came, he's now based in Pretoria, he came from the
                    northeast, the northern part and eastern part of the country where things grow
                    very prolifically, and this boot was filled with pineapples and mangos, avocado,
                    pears; and I said oh, Obed, I don't want you spending your money on me. And he
                    said, drawing himself up and looking down his face, he said, we do grow things,
                    you know, Gill. Putting me in my place completely.</p>
