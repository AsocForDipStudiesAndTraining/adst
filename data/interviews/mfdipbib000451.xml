<p>MYLES GREENE</p>
<p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
<p>Initial Interview date: February 22, 2002</p>
<p>Copyright 2003 ADST</p>
<p>Q:  Today is February 22, 2002.  It's George Washington's birthday.  This is an interview with Myles Greene.  This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.  Myles let's start at the beginning.  Can you tell me, when and where were you born?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I was born in Fort Valley, Georgia, a small town icentral Georgia, on October 19, 1925.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Look, can we get something, first about your father and hibackground and your mother and her background?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  They were both Georgia people from way back in this little town of Fort Valley, was my father's hometown.  My mother came there because she was a young schoolteacher assigned there.  They met and were married.  My father inherited from his father a hardware store and some other miscellaneous small businesses.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where is Fort Valley?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Macon is the largest place nearby and Fort Valley is maybe 15 or so miles southwest of Macon, not too far from Plains.  I like to say that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where President Jimmy Carter comes from?  GREENE:  That's right.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about, do you know much about the background of the Greenfamily on your father's side?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  A lot.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Of course, you're from Georgia, so you have to.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I have spent a lot of time on genealogy works.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, but I might get an idea of generally where they come from anall.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, they're English, they're not the New England Greenes, Nathaniel Greene and the Greenes of Rhode Island.  A lot have claimed that.  They came to Georgia originally in the 1600s and moved slowly south over the generations and wound up in Georgia after the Revolution when the state of Georgia was trying to attract new people.  Anyone who was a veteran or in any way associated with the Revolution, with the army, got free land.  So, the Greenes came there where the first one was named Myles Greene; I'm a fifth or sixth Myles Greene.  He was a businessman, banker, Methodist minister, you name it and from him I honestly don't know how many people came, but lots and lots and a number of whom have been Methodist ministers at one time or another.  My grandmother came likewise from a long line of Methodists, so I inherited this southern Methodist tradition.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your mother's family came from where?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  My mother's family also was from Georgia, a little town called Washington, Georgia which is about halfway between Athens and Augusta, a very charming old southern town with buildings that date back to the early 1800s.  We had a family reunion there this past June and some 80 people showed up.  It was very impressive.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was the family name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Her maiden name was Bounds.  They came originally from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  I went over there once, I think it's Salisbury and there were about 30 Bounds in the telephone book and I never knew that.  The Bounds Funeral Home is the main thing I noticed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about during the Civil War?  Did they get involved with that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh yes.  Well, my mother's father was a chaplain, a Methodist minister who became a chaplain, but was taken prisoner twice.  Each time when he was released, he walked, in one case 100 miles, to rejoin the regiment.  My Greene great grandfather, I never knew what exactly his problem was, but he had ill health of some sort and died during the Civil War without ever having gone into the military.</p>
<pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did Sherman's army go through your area?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Sherman's army went through very nearby there, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Just a point I have in mind.  My grandfather was I think a majoin Sherman's army at the time.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's not good.  My grandmother on my father's side has the story that when she was an infant in her mother's arms, Sherman came through, this was in Madison, Georgia where she lived.  I don't really believe this, but the Yankees took this very nice house where they lived, and seeing the baby there said, “Oh, throw the baby in the fire.”  Her mother said, “The baby goes in the fire and I go in the fire, too.”  So, they did not throw the baby in the fire.  So, you were on the wrong side.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Anyway, that was in Madison, Georgia.  But, you know, all of my ancestors were conservative southern Methodists.  At that time there was a split in the Methodist church because of slavery.  I have a strong Georgia background.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, did either your mother or your father go to higheeducation?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  My father was a graduate of Emory College as it was then, now a university, and my mother went to what was then called Georgia Normal School, which later became the education part of the University of Georgia.  I don't think you can classify my mother as actually a college graduate.  The Normal School was a teacher preparatory.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But it was a kind of.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was beyond high school.  She was there three years and mfather went through four years of college and graduated froEmory.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, then you moved.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Emory of course was a Methodist school.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I keep forgetting.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, it is more recently a Coca-Cola school, but it was a Methodist.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You say your family moved when you were five?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, this was during the depression.  My father went intbankruptcy.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This was a hardware business?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: He told me later, “If there is anything I've learned from my experience in the late '20s was don't move as fast as I did.”  He inherited the hardware store.  He also had, have you ever heard of Sinclair Gasoline?  He was the county agent for Sinclair Gasoline.  This was also peach county and he had some peach orchards and he did lots of things too fast.  I never have known exactly the details, but the fact is he lost our house, which was a nice place.  It's still there.  I think he also lost his mother's house which was next door and lost almost everything and moved to Florid.  At this time they used to say about half of the people in Florida were from Georgia, people who had moved there in bankruptcy or whatever.  So, they settled first in a place called Plant City, which is on the west side of Florida, and eventually after three years there moved to Fort Lauderdale, which is where I graduated from high school.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were going to grammar school in Florida, did you?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, I went, I started Kindergarten in Florida.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, let's stick to the elementary school first.  What subjects,I mean, did you find yourself enjoying school or not?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't remember that much about the very early years.  I remember there was a candy store near the school I used to like to go to the candy store, but in terms of what I liked and didn't like, I don't know.  I think pretty early on I developed an interest in history which certainly flowered in high school.  I was a very good student, very compulsive probably.  I remember when I was in the sixth or seventh grade I had the measles and my mother read all of my lessons to me, you weren't supposed to use your eyes in those days if you had measles.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, you were kept in a darkened room.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
<p>GREENE:  That's right, so my mother read me whatever it was I was supposed to be keeping up with at school.  Then I eventually went back right at the end of the year.  I remember the teacher said, “Why were you worried, you didn't have any problem, you did very well.”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I assume that you're a reader?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, I am.  I compare myself as a younger reader often with my wife who was much more a reader of what we would now call the classics.  I read more popular things.  I read all of the Rover Boys and Tom Swift and that sort of thing.  I remember a particular series in which that I must have had 15 different volumes, or maybe more, of boys or young men in different battles of the Civil War.  This was fiction, but it was built around different battles of the war and I read every one of those.  As I got a bit older I read “Gone With The Wind,” two or three volumes of “R. E. Lee,” the biography of Robert E. Lee bFreeman.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I'm from the opposite side.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Very early on, I was interested in history and in terms oelementary school all I can remember mostly is that I did quite well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about at home?  Was there, in the first place, did you havbrothers or sisters?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I was an only child.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was it sort of sitting around the dining room table at night antalking about?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  About politics.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, that was it.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  My father was a strong proponent, supporter of FDR. My parents for their day were amazingly liberal on racial relations.  Today it wouldn't seem very exciting, but at that time they were on good terms with several black people.  My mother took a young black man, older teenager who had a speech impediment, took him to some kind of speech therapy once a week.  When she died, this guy, who was then of course a grown man, and had gotten a job as a TV repairman at Sears Roebuck, came to her funeral as thanks for what she had done.  Anyway, yes, we talked about politics during the first and second terms of the Roosevelt administration.</p>
<pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you sit around and listen to the fireside chats?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  We did that and, of course, we had a radio and we listened to it.  I actually started reading the paper fairly early and I still have a notebook of clippings I began to make about the very early part of World War II before we got into it.  So, I was really wrapped up in history and in politics.  My father was a hardworking businessman and very disappointed by his earlier bankruptcy, but held on to his very firm political views.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What kind of business did your father go into then?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  He had several businesses in Georgia and, as I said, he acquired some peach orchards there.  In Florida he went into the winter vegetable business, a sort of a middleman.  He owned a packinghouse in a couple different places in Florida eventually, once he got settled.  He would finance farmers with the understanding that those farmers would put their product through his packing house and he in turn would sell it to some brokerage firm in the north.  Philadelphia became a major market of his products.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in high school you went to high school where?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That would have been when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I was in the class of '43.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, from '39 to '43.  How did World War II impact on you durinyour high school period because '39 to '43 the war was really?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  As I've said, I made these two albums with clippings from the newspaper about what was going on.  My father had been very briefly in the army toward the end of World War I and of course, was too old to be in World War II.  I owned a 1936 Ford convertible with a rumble seat.  The rumble seat had the floor rusted out so you could sit in the rumble seat and touch the road down beneath you.  The car cost $200 and I didn't have $200 so my father must have paid for it. I got the, I don't know what they call it, the 5C ration book for gasoline or something like that which I think was the lowest.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Maybe C was, I can't remember.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Whichever it was, for business reasons or any other reasonfor having a car.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  At the lower end of the totem pole you got you know one gerry caof gas a month or something.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I could drive to school.  I took my girlfriends on dates, which was fun.  We had a little clique of five or six guys, all of whom became lawyers except me and I, of course, went into the Foreign Service.  My best friend was Odel Hraasen's son, Carl. He is a very well known author of mysteries today.  He makes millions of dollars on these things.  Anyway, Odel and I went down to Miami one Sunday, December 7th, 1941, to see the Miami Open where all the big time golfers were, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, all these people.  Toward the end of the afternoon, people in the crowd began to say, “Did you hear, did you hear what's going on?”  We finally figured out this out about the Japanese attacks, here we were 25 miles from home with this ramshackle car of mine.  That was really when it hit me that we were in a war.</p>
<p>Q:  For many people of your age, really my age, I'm a couple of years younger than you, there's nothing like World War II as a geography lesson.  You know where Guadalcanal was, and you know, we knew the globe.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh absolutely, that's right.  Well, I have two grandsons who are both very bright in geography and I wonder if they inherited it from me.  I think some of it I got from that period, I not only cut out articles, but also maps with red arrows and you know, the Russians were going around Smolansk or something. So, yes, that's a good point.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about in high school, were you involved in sports odramatics or anything like that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I was not much of a sports person.  I was involved in a lot of other things.  I was Valedictorian of my class.  I was a lot of different things, but none of which had to do with sports much.  I was the manager of the basketball team and the basketball team that won the state championship.  So, that was really something.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, that's big stuff.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
<p>GREENE:  It was big stuff in those days.  We beat Miami High.  I was treasurer of the student body; I was the captain or president of the debate team.  I was the manager of the school plays.  Probably more important to my future career was a woman who had first taught me American history in junior high and by the time I became a senior she had transferred and was the senior American history teacher.  She was fantastic.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who was she?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Her name was Opal Atwater, a very unusual name.  Odel, my friend, and I used to go in early and help her clean the blackboard.  I would say more than anyone, including my parents, that Miss Atwater pointed me into history and related subjects.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about movies and all that?  Were you a movie fan?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't remember much about movies.  I remember going tMiami Beach once to see Gone With The Wind.  I remember it well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In 1943 you graduated and, of course, the United Stats wasomewhat involved in World War II.  What happened?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  Well, not what I anticipated.  There was at that time something called the Army Specialized Training Program, ASTP, which was based idea that you were training with it, but the idea was that somebody somewhere was worried that when the war was over there weren't going to be enough college graduates around and so they take some of the “brighter young men” going into the service and put them in college so there would be somebody who is jut finishing college when the war was over.  I thought that made sense and I don't remember, I don't remember if I took an exam or with I did, but anyway I went and signed up and so instead of whatever the draftees number is, I don't remember what the number begins with.  My army serial number begins with a “1,” which proves that I was not drafted; I was a volunteer 14185015; I'll never forget it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  AF21270823.  That's mine.  I'm a Korean War type.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
<p>GREENE:  I had to wait until I was 18, so since my father had been to Emory annd we had lots of family connections to Emory,  I went there for a semester.  At that time colleges were going year round and so almost immediately after I graduated from high school and my good friend Odel and I went together to Emory.  Then, let's see, I passed my 18th birthday and the magic number was coming up in the ASTP program.  You had to have basic infantry training for 13 weeks before going on to Nirvana or wherever it was they were going to send you.  I went to Fort Benning, Georgia where there were lots and lots of people just like me, 18-year-olds, fairly bright guys who had done exactly the same thing that I had done.  About half way through this, wham, the whole program was canceled and we were all put in the infantry.  My immediate group was sent off to the 86th Division in Louisiana.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I've just been interviewing Bill Morgan, I don't know if you knoBill.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I know Bill.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Bill had the same, he ended up in the 87th in Patton's Army.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  At 18 years old I guess I didn't feel it; some people would have felt this is a stab in the back, what are you doing to me?  I think my recollection in looking back at it was, well this is the way it is and that's what happened.  Our group finished basic training in Fort Benning.  We went to Camp Livingston in Louisiana and joined the 86th division in the spring of '44.  Hot.  Have you ever been in Louisiana in the summer?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I've been in Mississippi in the summer in the '40s.  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Of course, there's no air conditioning.  It was really something.  We were being trained as a division to do something and so we were taking enormous packs on our backs in 100-degree weather.  It was really excruciating.  I did not stay in ASTP.  That's the bottom line.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, what happened, okay, that would take you in the ASTinterview.  Were you a rifleman?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, for some reason that I never understood I became thBAR, remember the BAR?  Browning Automatic Rifle.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, usually they give it to the smallest guy.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I can tell you it weighed something like 18 pounds plus the tripod you'd put on the front which would add three or four pounds to it.  Plus if you were really, really going to use it, you had to carry ammunition and there were several pounds on a special belt that you had.  It was a big amount.  I was not the smallest person, and I have no idea why.  We were in a rifle company in the 342nd Regiment and why I was a BAR man I have no idea, but I was.  I later dragged that all across Europe.  I met many years later my father-in-law, who was a great hunter, and he was really taken aback by the fact that I didn't want to handle a rifle or gun, but I said, really, I've had it.  He had dogs and guns and everything and because I had had this experience, he figured I was a top-notch person with a gun.  I said, no really, I don't think I want to.  We were there throughout the summer and were informed we were going to be part of an invasion of Japan.  So we went to California, San Louis Obispo, and received amphibious training to learn how to storm the beaches.  It's beautiful country.  I really enjoyed it I must say.  I never had been to California before.  My parents came out for the Christmas and somehow or other I had leave at Christmas of '44 and we went to Los Angeles, my parents and I.  The 86thdivision also had, at a camp, Camp something, next to San Diego, a sort of advanced amphibious training.  It's a marine base I think.  So, anyway, we were all ready to invade Japan supposedly and all of a sudden we realized that the forces in Europe were not doing as well as they should have been doing.  The Battle of the Bulge was not going exactly as somebody, Eisenhower, wanted it to go so he said I need some more men.  So, all of a sudden the 86th Division instead of preparing to go to invade Japan were put on trains.  We went all the way across the country to Boston, on to ships to Europe for which we had not been exactly prepared.  This regiment, actually the company, Company L, still has reunions, amazingly enough.  I've seen some of these guys and I exchange Christmas cards with some of them.  I have not been to a reunion because it doesn't interest me.  Anyway, the point that I was trying to make was that actual combat time once we crossed the country, and the Atlantic Ocean, got set up in France, moved up to the front line, Cologne, was less than three months.  So, our long, long trip whether we actually added anything to the final victory I have no idea, but we were initially in Cologne and then the Ruhr pocket. I don't know how much of an expert you are on World War II.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The Ruhr pocket?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right, the Ruhr pocket was made by some part of the army and then somebody had to go into the pocket and clear out the Germans inside. One interesting thing, I'm sure this will be fascinating to anyone who's interested in the Foreign Service, but being a Southern Methodist I didn't drink at that time, this was just not something you did and one little town where we took lots of German prisoners in the Ruhr also had a winery and my company or maybe the whole regiment, I don't remember with the possible exception of a few of us, including me, went wildly drunk on the wine in this winery.  I was a PFC all this time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Private first class.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  All of us, who had thought we were going to ASTP, we were all PFCs.  We were all under what we considered lesser people who were the sergeants who had been in the army longer than we, but who had not had the privilege of thinking they were going into ASTP.  We had a very close group, all the PFCs, but we really didn't associate with the sergeants and certainly not with the lieutenants.  I later heard some stories about one of the lieutenants who made a lot of money on the side selling army equipment to German civilians.  He wound up in prison apparently.  I didn't know all of this until much later.  So, after the Ruhr pocket was more or less mopped up, mostly by us, we took lots of prisoners.  I have a pistol that I got from one of these Germans.  We were transferred to the south in Patton's army.  I've forgotten the name of this place, but anyway, the fact is we moved very fast because of course it was quite near the end of the roar.  One of the most memorable personal events took place at that time.  We were storming this small town and the guy next to me; another ex-ASTP, was killed just a few inches from me.  He just dropped dead from a bullet.  I'll never forget that.  That brought the whole business closer to me than anything that had ever happened to me.  I mean we had all kinds of difficulties, all kinds of hardships, but having someone, a friend, right next to me, suddenly be shot and die is to say, memorable to put it mildly.  So, we went on across Bavaria and we were moving very, very fast.  One of the kindest things my mother did to me during this time, was to send me every week or two a change of underwear.  I really appreciated it; I mean brand new underwear.  I'd throw the dirty ones away and put on the new ones.  We'd sleep out in the open.  There was still snow.  I remember spending nights in barns on top of hay and that sort of thing.  I was at the very end, very slightly wounded.  This scar that you can see right here is a piece of shrapnel that hit me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In your hand?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, my right hand.  We were just entering Austria and Austria of course, technically was an ally, even though it had been made a part of Germany.</p>
<p>GREENE:  As soon as we entered Austria, we had entirely different rules about what we could and couldn't do.  We had to treat the people nicely.  We could not take over their houses the way we did in Germany.  We could not take over whatever it was that we did in Germany.  We were not too far from Salzburg and that was the end of the war.</p>
<p>Q:  While you were, I mean obviously you were occupied, but I assume that you and most of your fellow ASTPers were looking forward to going back to the university?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh yes, yes.  We figured this was it, the war was over anlet's go home.</p>
<pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
<p>Q:  It's interesting though, I just finished an interview with Bill Morgan as I mentioned, but this was right before the World War II oral history program and he mentioned the tremendous distinction or division in the division.  This was the 87th, between the ASTP people and particularly there because they were northerners.  Bill is from Rochester, New York and these northerners coming down to essentially a southern division run by you know, the sergeants and all were not well educated.</p>
<p>GREENE:  I know exactly what you mean.  I'm a southerner myself, but he's right in that almost of the sergeants were from the south.  They were sort of poor boys as they were called in those days and they really enjoyed being above all these little college brats which we were and we didn't like that.  I can't remember any of them that we liked.  It was a very significant fact of life for all of the years that I was in the 86th Division.</p>
<p>Q:  Did you get any, I mean, obviously you were moving on the run, but did you get any feeling for Europe.  I mean these were the guys, I want to shoot these people or what?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I don't know.  The feeling I had was that the German forces looked quite pitiful.  They had very young and very old men.  They were retreating as fast as they could at the very end and the ones who surrendered, particularly in the Ruhr pocket seemed quite delighted to be taken in.  There was no problem when I said, “I'd like to have that pistol”, I took the pistol from this one man.  It was a foregone conclusion at that point that we were going to win the war.  I had never been in Europe of course and it seemed pretty primitive to me except for our first period in combat which was right on the Rhine in Cologne where we were supposedly watching that side of the river as somebody else went around to form the Ruhr pocket.  We took over a number of what I'm sure were very expensive houses right on the river in Cologne.  The houses impressed me.  That was the only case where we saw anything that looked like it might have cost some money.  We went through many small towns, many primitive places.  I remember one interesting incident, which we were in this small town and I was on night guard or something.  We had stopped there for the night and I was on duty on the edge of town and a German boy who spoke some English came out to me and said, “Your president is dead.”  It was true.  That was where I learned that Roosevelt had died.  But this was a boy in a small German town.  Exactly how he knew this I'm not sure.  He even spoke some English, which was impressive.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you get involved or hear of anybody who was involved ifreeing these concentration camps and all that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not really, no.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, this wasn't part of the.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
<p>GREENE:  No, we were not part of that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What happened, I mean the war ended in April of '45.  GREENE:  May 5th.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I mean May.  What?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I have more to tell about that.  You want to hear more?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, let's hear more because I think this is important.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  We were the last division to arrive in Europe and therefore the first to leave Europe to go to the Pacific again to invade Japan supposedly.  They were going to take us back to the U.S., give us each a month's leave and we would reassemble in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  All of this came about as planned except that as we reassembled the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima and we all figured well, that's it, let's go home.  Well, I never have known whether it was just slowing the wheels down or exactly what, but we went on to the Pacific.  The war was over.  Exactly what anybody had in mind never filtered down to us poor folks at the bottom of the heap, but we went to Manila and about the time that we got there, the so-called point system came about explaining how many points you needed to be discharged.  In the meantime, we sat there and we really did just about nothing.  I mean honestly.  It was a disgrace.  We guarded what remained of the Philippine national stock of gold.  We took turns going into that part of the city of Manila to stand guard around the treasury and we really didn't do much of anything until the very end.  This is reminiscent of what is going on right at the moment.  There was some trouble down in Mardinao where there are Muslims and thugs of some sort and a small portion of our division was sent down there to try to calm things, but not me.  The other thing that personally for me that was really important in the Philippines, was I guess it's the chaplain's office, organized a whole room of college catalogs for us, and I spent quite a bit of time going through these catalogs.  I had decided here I was 20 years old or something like that and away from my parents making decisions on my own and decided that what I really wanted was something to do with international relations.  So, I looked at the catalogs to see what schools had international relations departments or taught subjects in them.  I think maybe I did send a letter to Emory saying that I was approaching the end of my service and I assumed that I would be welcomed back or something like that.  I didn't really reapply, but I applied to Yale and then in March of '46 came home.  I hadn't heard anything from Yale and was planning to just relax for a little while and then go to Emory in summer school, but in May Yale said they'd like to interview me.  So, I, this little southern boy, went up to New Haven, Connecticut and was interviewed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The what?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
<p>GREENE:  SATs?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I'm not sure they were SATs.  Anyway, I'd never taken them.  You know Yale is heavy with prep school young men and there I was from this small town high school.  I was interviewed and the guy looked at my high school record and he said, “You didn't have much trouble in high school, did you?”  I said, “No, I didn't.  I was valedictorian of my class.”  He didn't say anything, like well, happy to have you with us or something.  He didn't say anything so I went home and went to Emory in June of '46 and been there a week and got a telegram from Yale saying you're admitted.  So, without really consulting my parents, I sent a reply saying I accept.  Do you remember or maybe you don't remember at that time we had a G.I. Bill of course and just the amount of paperwork to transfer the tuition payment from Emory to Yale, plus the, was it $75 a month or something like that?  So, I went immediately to New Haven for the short summer session and went through the whole four years there.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, when you were looking at college catalogs, because colleges hadn't geared up for the new world, but you know, the post World War II world, but they were reflecting what really had been prior, you know, before we got terribly involved in the war.  International studies is not a big, I mean, you know, there are pretty few colleges.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, Yale was one of them that did.  Yale had a very distinguished group of professors.  At that time, Yale and probably Harvard, I'm not sure, Princeton likewise had one and maybe a few others, but the Yale catalog made it quite obvious that this was a really strong department and I took the bait.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, then you went to Yale when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '46 to '50.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  '46 to '50.  You're the class of '50?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I'm the class of '50, yes.</p>
<p>Q:  Let's talk about Yale at that time, I mean, how did you find it coming from, I mean, although you may have come from the south, most people were military.</p>
<pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
<p>GREENE:  At Yale?  Yes, well, we had the biggest class I think that ever entered Yale and the so-called suites in the dormitories were, a little living room and two very small bedrooms were made for two students but then were changed for four students, we had two cots per room.  I don't know the percentage of my class, but certainly well over half of it was military, former military people.  What I didn't understand and what I eventually became quite uncomfortable with was the dominating role played at Yale, by people who had been to prep schools, which I had not been.  All of these people had been to Exeter and Andover and all these place. I didn't really know what a prep school was.  In the south, if someone is not a “good boy” in school he's sent to a military school.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's sort of a punishment.  If you don't do this, you're going to go to military school.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right, and I had some people I knew who'd been to military schools, but prep schools I wasn't really aware of.  Here these guys were with flashy Brooks Brothers clothes and they all knew each other one way or the other and they knew exactly how they should behave in New Haven.  It was quite a comedown for me.</p>
<p>Q:  I have to say for my own sake, I was not a veteran at that point.  But I went to a prep school and then I went to Williams, but I felt very much the outsider because 70% of our class were vets like you.  You'd seen the elephant and we hadn't.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  We were vets and some people became famous; I mean foexample Bill Buckley was in my class.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  God and man at Yale.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, that's right.  People who later became quite well known, lots of whom had been to prep schools plus military.  But the four people with whom I roomed beginning my freshman year were, well three of the four were like me, rather small town people, not prep school.  We'd all been in the army.  Nobody had a particularly distinguished army career, but we all had done something.  So, in that way I was lucky.  Fortunately, I was not thrown in with the latest group from Andover or wherever.  Still my very best friend from Yale who lives right here in town is one of those roommates from my freshman year.  He's from a small town in Missouri.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, now how did you find the education there?  Let's talk abouthe impact of freshman classes and all that.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh yes.  I guess I thought I won't have any problems here.  I was the valedictorian of my class and all that, but in a class of 150 students at the most, probably less than that.  Even though I worshiped my history teacher I'm sure the teaching was not very outstanding to say the least.  For example there is a requirement at Yale that everyone must take one of three things, Greek, Latin or a course called classical civilizations which the latter is what almost everyone took, including me.  I had never heard of all these Greek playwrights and these people.  I'd heard of Plato, but that's about as far as I went.  All these people who'd been to prep schools were at least acquainted with these names and I felt very out of it to tell you the truth.  More and more because of that background I worked hard trying to keep up with everybody.  Did okay, not sensationally, but I did all right in school.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about on the international side, did you, was there any areyou were particularly interested in?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The short answer is no.  I entered as international relations major and then international relations and political science are sort of first cousins in terms of the two departments.  I slipped over to political science as opposed to international relations, but looking back on it now I actually took at least as many hours in history, which is what I really should have majored in more than either of the other two, but I felt very comfortable in all three of those subjects as opposed to some of the things that I had never heard of such as classical civilizations.</p>
<p>Q:  Were you looking into any particular area I mean the courses are very strong in China, you know those ties to the Far East, I was wondering whether.</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I tell you where I got my interest between my junior and senior years.  I had quite a bit of money then because I'd been in the army and hadn't spent a penny.  I had this accumulated money and I went with a small group of people led by a young assistant professor of international relations on a tour of what was then the new Marshall Plan countries.  We went to Italy, Greece and Turkey to see how this new idea was working out. This was our pouring money in order to develop the war economies of these countries.  Rather than north Europe we went to Italy, Greece and Turkey and I enjoyed it all.  I was absolutely taken by Turkey.  We spent three weeks there, a combination of half Ankara and half Istanbul and I really thought that this was absolutely fascinating.  I had never taken a course on that part of the world.  I really didn't know that much about it.  I never did take a course, but I saw myself headed that way, as you will hear later, and I eventually got my master's degree in Middle East studies.  I'm sure it began that summer.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  During this trip, did you run across at the university embassies,consulates, Foreign Service past your review at all?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
<p>GREENE:  Lots of what we now call AID.  That kind of person, embassy people very slightly.  I had a high school friend, a woman, who of course had not been in the military who had finished college, who was something to do with budget office in Rome.  I saw her several times and went to the embassy with her and went to the ambassador's 4th of July party with her, which was enormous.  I mean hundreds of people.  We went out to some lake outside of Rome and had a picnic one-day I recall that.  So, that, Rome yes, but not because of our group, which did have a lot of connections with the economic aid people, but not with the embassy.  In fact, the economic assistance people were very generous.  I mean we, as visitors, were rare creatures.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is not a period of tourism.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, by no means.  Nothing like a Hilton Hotel.  There wersome very miserable places to stay.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Back in college did you get, what was the social life like?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  What was it like?  Well, I had a very steady girlfriend from Florida, a former Fort Lauderdale High School classmate who had graduated from college while I was out winning the war.  She was a sort of an assistant editor, very low level assistant editor in some publishing house in New York City.  We reestablished contact and she came to New Haven sometime for football games and I went down there some weekends for plays or whatever.  I had a cousin at Smith at the time and I would go up there occasionally.  She had friends with whom I dated, but Lorraine and I and her were seriously involved and talking about marriage. She was a Christian scientist, which my mother practically died over.  At some point, Lorraine never explained what happened.  She wasn't feeling well and of course she was a true believer in Christian Science and she did not go to a doctor, one day Lorraine said, “I better go home.”  That was real home, Florida, and she did so and she died.  At age 22 or something like that.  I always had thought that if she had gone to a doctor...</p>
<p>Q:  Of course, this is the, I mean, one looks at this I always consider myself thanks to Mary Baker Eddie I'm here because my mother's first husband died of appendicitis and he was a Christian scientist and so she remarried and I came along.  I don't think this was Mary Baker Eddie's idea.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Lorraine was a great girl and we had been together a bit since seniors in high school and then I was gone to the army and she was in college and we reestablished contact.  We probably would have married.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  As you were approaching 1950 what were you looking at doing?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Do you want a really honest answer?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Finding some more school to go to rather than trying to go out and do whatever it was to earn money.  I applied at two places for graduate work and the only time I ever was turned down was one of those two, the Woodrow Wilson School of whatever they called it at Princeton.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's the Woodrow Wilson School.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  School of Government Service or something like that.  Anyway, I never knew why I was turned down.  I went for a very easy, a very cold year to Syracuse University, the Maxwell School of Public Administration and directly from that to a program run by the government civil service program which is supposed to be for people who are specially prepared and brighter.  You could start as a GS-7 instead of a GS-5 in whatever part of the government.  I told them I wanted to get in the international part of the government and was sent to what was then called the USIE, later USIS and then USIA.  So, that was my first real job in international affairs.</p>
<p>Q:  I was just wondering, Yale being Yale, was the CIA sniffing around?  I was in the class of '50 at Williams and we had an awful lot of young men with bow ties coming up from Washington.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh yes.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was aware of young men with bow ties, but the crew coach was being paid by the CIA to point young men in that direction.  He got $10,000 a year for putting the finger on young men.  Buckley went in the CIA for a while and quite a number of people did.  I never thought about it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was Buckley a figure?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh yes.  Buckley was a figure.  He didn't do very well academically.  I have a friend here in town, my roommate, my good friend here in town who always likes to say Buckley couldn't get into Yale Law School, he flunked while my friend did go.  Yes, Buckley, I was in the class with him on comparative economic systems, which we studied some places like Sweden and England where people were doing things that capitalist Americans didn't do.  The whole class mostly was arguing between Buckley and the teacher about what miserable ways Sweden was going.  He was eventually editor of the Yale News, which was a big time job.  The last person tapped for the most honorable Skull and Bones was supposedly the outstanding person in the class and that's Bill Buckley.  But I wasn't in those things.  What were we talking about?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, when you went to Syracuse, what was Syracuse doing, I meait's a Maxwell School?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, it wasn't what I really wanted, it was pretty technical public administration and I was there only nine months.  You had to write a paper, a dissertation in order to get the masters degree and I was so uninterested in it in the end I never wrote the paper, I never got the degree.  I got a job in Washington and came down here.  I still have several friends from those nine or ten months in Syracuse.  Sometimes, at some point in my freshman or sophomore year at Yale, the Veterans Administration announced that they would pay for career counseling for any veteran. It cost $75, which at that time was a lot of money.  You took written exams and talked to somebody who knew about careers and out of this got results.  Well, one of my results was that I would be very good in administration which was not what I got into, but in thinking back on it I probably would have been good in administration as opposed to political and political military which was where I spent most of my time. I never really had an administrative job in my life.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then when you got out of Maxwell this would have been in '5I assume?  Did you go to, then you got this job?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, I got married first.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You married?  Okay, let's talk about your wife.  How did you meeher and what is her background?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, after Lorraine died, I did go home.  Lots of summers I did not. I went to Europe one summer, I worked here in town for then Senator Claude Pepper one year.  I did go home one summer and didn't do much of anything, but some friends of my parents, another couple their age, thought I needed a date and they got me a blind date with this young lady, Tina Haynes.  She was in college in Tallahassee and I would see her at Christmas and here and yon and we got along very well.  After I graduated from Yale while I was on vacation from Syracuse, we became engaged.  We're still married, 50 years and some months now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where does her family come from?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Kentucky.  Well, they live in Florida, but they are all Kentuckians and they want you to know it.  A town called Owensboro, Kentucky, which is west in Kentucky.  Tina's mother's family (Hardwick) owned the department store there and they had quite a bit of money, actually they were millionaires I suppose, but they weren't Rockefellers.  Tina's father came from a small town just outside of Owensboro and had no money.  He was the only person in his family forever and ever and ever to go to college, the University of Kentucky.  He was a terrific athlete and was very ambitious.  Some of the Hardwicks moved to Florida, and he (D.C. Haynes) followed them there, and proposed to this young lady and they married.  They sold the Kentucky store and bought citrus groves in Florida.  My wife now owns some citrus groves that began from that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, anyway, you came to Washington as a newly married couple?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  We were married July 14, Bastille Day in Florida.  We went to Nassau for our honeymoon and came up here.  I started my job sometime in August of '51.</p>
<p>Q:  I want to go back just quickly.  You worked for Claude Pepper who was quite a figure both in the well, in the Early New Deal and later on.  The guy kept going until forever practically.  What were you doing there?</p>
<pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
<p>GREENE:  He did.  Well, I think my father must have contributed to his campaign.  He had some sort of connection.  My wife's very interested in campaign finance reform, and so I think back on what was my connection to Claude Pepper.  My father must have contributed. I wrote to the Senator's assistant and said I'd like very much to have a job this summer.  This was the summer of '48 and I was hired.  I was paid almost nothing.  I stayed in a one room in a rooming house with no air conditioning.  It was miserably hot, but it was fun.  This was the summer that Truman was president and was nominated for another term.  Claude Pepper was his left wing opponent who stayed in the party, as opposed to Wallace who got out of the party and started his own.  I always thought Pepper could beat Truman at the convention, but he did not.  Then he was defeated as a senator two years later.  Red Pepper they called him. Anyway, I was a letter writer to constituents.  People would write asking what can I do to so and so and I would call the appropriate part of the U.S. government to find the answer and draft a reply.  It was not a breathtaking job, but it was lots of fun.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, also it gave you a feel later on in the Foreign Servicabout constituents, that congress was interesting.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was wonderful.  I even found my way around the Capitol, which is quite an accomplishment.  Have you ever been in all those halls?</p>
<p>Q:  No.</p>
<p>GREENE:  It's really something.  Yes, I can't say I had much to do with any other congressional office.  I suppose I knew somebody, but not much.  Pepper's office was big as senatorial offices went in those days, some really bright people and they were all quite willing to let me do something.  I was the only summer intern, but I sure learned a lot about, not only what was going on in the senate and with Pepper and his connections back to Florida, but also, his placement in the broader national Democratic Party.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It was not that cut and dry?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, it was fascinating.  Pepper was gone for at least ten days leading up to the convention.  In the end as I recall, he really didn't have that much support.  He didn't come anywhere near defeating Truman for the nomination.  He was so marked by being the voice of the left wing of the Democratic Party; people called him Red Pepper.  This was in the Cold War and he was defeated by George Smathers two years later in Florida.</p>
<p>Q:  Wasn't he the one who said that Senator Pepper's sister is a well-known thespian?  She was a, stuck with, sounded like something else.</p>
<pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  Anyway, Pepper, was from Tallahassee settled in Miami Beach as a lawyer and then later was elected to the House from there.  He rejoined the congress as a representative, but everyone still called him senator.  I never saw him in those days, but I knew people who did.  He was a very successful.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He was a powerhouse.  He was the voice for the elderly, too.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  He became the chairman of the Rules Committee, which is a very powerful position.  Anyway, I did see a lot of him that summer of '48 and that was a very valuable experience.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We're coming to '51 I guess when you're coming to USIA, well iwas the information services at that time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: It was I guess it was called USIE, United States Information and Education Agency, something like that.  It was Eisenhower who wanted to change the name to Federal Information Agency which would be pronounced FIA and people would say, “We have nothing to fear but, FIA itself.”  Anyway, yes, I was there.  Do you want me to talk some about that?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I had a very unusual job there.  Again sort of made for a young person who would be going on to other things, the secretariat of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Information.  It had a small staff of five or six people and a five-member commission from distinguished people in the field of journalism.  Cannon who was the editor of Christian Science Monitor and the guy who was the editor of Saturday Evening Post if you can remember back that far?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh yes.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
<p>GREENE:  Somebody who owned this series of papers in the mid-west. Anyway, they were all big names in the field of journalism.  They would meet every six to eight weeks, but in the meantime we were supposed to keep them informed on things and they were supposed to make recommendations.  I was the guy who would pull all this together and send them not in my name, send them what in effect was a biweekly report of what was going on in USIE.  So, I learned a lot about the organization in general even though I was pretty lowly.  Then I would sit in with these quite distinguished five men when they would come to town.  I don't remember any big fights or whether they might have had with the administration.  I spent a little over a year there and in the meantime, we of course were looking for a place to live and at the very end of it my wife was pregnant.  I was offered a USIE job in Cairo as the assistant information officer.  Well, that didn't sound like what I wanted, I'm not sure why I though that, but i didn't really want it.  Maybe it was because I knew we were expecting a child.  However, my wife later had a miscarriage.  Anyway, so I said I was not very interested.  I had a friend from Syracuse who was in an organization called OCB, Operations Coordinating Board, part of the NSC.  By this time Eisenhower was president and a guy named Jackson, who had been the editor of Fortune, headed the OCB.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This was '53?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes. Eisenhower wanted to rev up the propaganda operations, so he established this board of NSC that would coordinate all U.S. agencies having to do with the overseas information and propaganda, their the plans and operations.  Jackson had a small staff and we were right there on Lafayette Square.  I guess what I was was the assistant to the executive secretary, mostly meant that I helped move paper around.  The most important thing I remember is at Eisenhower's inauguration parade, we were right there on the corner opposite the grandstands.  We were able to stand in our building and could have shot Eisenhower easily.  Anyway, as the months passed and this guy Jackson decided he could accomplish whatever it was he was trying to accomplish by other means and so we had less and less to do.  That's the gist of it.  I had in the back of my mind the whole time the Foreign Service.  I said maybe I should go about this more seriously and get in the Foreign Service instead of just having job tossed at me.  So, I thought I needed to do some graduate work, which is the next stage of my life.  Do you want to go there?</p>
<p>Q:  Well, why don't we stop here?  I think it's probably a good idea.  We'll pick this up in 1953 when you're off to graduate work?  Great.</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  ***</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is March 7, 2002.  Myles so you're going to get yourself little graduate education.  Where did you go?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
<p>GREENE:  I went to SAIS in town here, the School of Advanced International Studies, part of Johns Hopkins.  It was interesting they said they could always tell what was hot in the news according to which area of area specially got the most applicants.  I had applied there through personal interest the Middle East studies program and was accepted.  I was married, so I lived at home and my wife was working and eventually was pregnant.  Our first child arrived precisely with my final exams, which was difficult.  Anyway, I majored in Middle East studies and it was an enormous help.  I don't know what else to say.  Two years of Middle East studies.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you find that SAIS and this was in the mid-'50s, did thehave a focus or theme, did you get anything about the Middle East?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  In those days, SAIS was much more, almost entirely regional studies.  I understand now has become less geographic and more substantive specializations, economics, political military, things like that plus some area studies, too.  But, I was mostly in Middle East studies.  I had the pleasure of sitting in with Paul Nitze in a seminar that he ran there, which was certainly not about the Middle East.  It was mostly about his ideas.</p>
<p>Q:  I was just wondering whether when they were doing the Middle East, did they sort of distribute it throughout to include Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Israel?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, the basic program headed by a guy from Iraq named Khadduri who was a fairly big name in that day.  In fact the main professorship at SAIS on the Middle East is now named the Khadduri chair.  So, it was basically about the Arab part of the Middle East, but there were courses on Iran and Turkey taught by an escapee from FSI here named Ed Wright.  I don't know if you ever new Ed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I did.  I think he used to come down to FSI from time to timwhen I was there.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, he was a fascinating guy, he was born in Iran of missionary parents almost violently anti-Israel.  So, he gave a particular flavor to what he had to say.  I also took a on international economics.  I did not take anything on what we now call South Asia.  The line was drawn at the eastern side of Iran, but beyond that Afghanistan wasn't part of the course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  After two years I guess you're with a child and all that.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  I wanted to go in the Foreign Service.  I graduated from SAIS in late May.  The baby was born on May 15th.  I remember that certainly.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which year?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '55.  He's now an FSO.  So, a couple of weeks later the Foreign Service written exam was being given and I, as a citizen of Florida, even though it didn't make much sense, was told I should take the exam in Florida.  This was before the days of much air conditioning in June and where they were giving it was in an old high school building in Tampa, Florida.  It was incredibly uncomfortable.  I never will forget that day.  Obviously I couldn't just sit around because, as you say, with a wife and a baby and see what happened.  So, through my SAIS connections I got a job as an editorial assistant on the Middle East Journal which was a publication of the Middle East Institute which was originally located fairly near SAIS, but had moved to N Street.  So, I worked with the editor, his name was Harvey Hall, a great expert on the area, and my job was chiefly keeping up with the book reviews and the chronology, the magazine had a chronology for people who couldn't follow day to day events in the Middle East.  Book reviews which some of I arranged and others which Howard Hall arranged.  I made about $300 a month which was not a great deal even then, but we got by.  I started in July, but before Christmas I had been informed that I had passed the Foreign Service written exam and I should report for the oral exam.  I did so in one of the whole quonset huts down by the State Department.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  On 23rd Street?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, that's right.  I was nervous obviously.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you recall the exam?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't recall much, the only question that has always stuck in my mind, they said what newspaper do you read?  I said, “I read the Washington Post and sometimes I see the NeYork Times.”  They said, “Could you compare the editorial policy of those two papers?”  I hemmed and hawed a bit on that, but it must have been okay.  There were four of us there waiting in the room to be interviewed by two separate panels and the other three were each called after the oral was over, called into a room.  Each one came out looking very sad.  They had not passed.  Then I was called in and said that I had passed.  At that time there was an age limit on entering the Foreign Service,  31.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think around 31 sticks in my mind.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
<p>GREENE:  I was 30 at the time so I was right up to the barrier.  They said that I would be hearing from them that probably I would be in the March class and I was. I joined the Foreign Service in early March of '56 and worked at the Middle East Institute right up to that time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Talk about the Middle East Institute, did you find did it have a thrust or was it since there is so much interest in this new state of Israel, I mean was the Middle East Institute trying to redress the balance by looking sort of at the Arab side or?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was more pro-Arab than a lot of other organizations in the United States. In terms of policy and articles, decisions on articles, it was dominated by Arab scholars of various sorts who were on the board there.  The other part was where did they get money to run the Middle East Institute and there they were much more open.  There was a lady, a widow of someone who was very interested, and she gave a lot of money.  She was not Jewish, but there were other Jewish organizations and other agencies who did give some money.  So, they must have balanced it out somehow, but it was clearly more pro-Arab.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You went in when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  March '56.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  March '56.  What was your A-100 course like?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The A-100 course was divided.  We took six weeks of the introductory part and then they wanted for efficiency purposes to combine us with another class, so they said let's do something else for a month, tread water.  In my case I knew some Spanish, quite a bit, so they put me in Spanish class for a month and at the end of which we joined up with another class, for a monthly of consular work.  I must say looking back on it, I hardly knew what a consul was or what consular work was and didn't know much about the Foreign Service except the political part which interested me a great deal.  Nobody ever gave us what I would call career counseling, that is, would you like to be an administrative officer, would you like to be a commercial officer or what is your background, what are your interests?  I don't remember anything like that.  So, I, like my friend Alfonzo Arenales said when he was given three choices of what he wanted to do and he replied, “I want political, political and political” so that was the way I felt, too.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about the composition of your A-100 course?  Do you recalany of the people or where they were from?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, two or three of them were and still are friends.  In fact, one of them and I went to the same post together after the class.  Bob Dillon was another one in this combined class.  There were all kinds of people.  My offhand recollection is that there were not any people I would say who were really water walkers, the expression they use these days.  Out of our class I believe only one person became an ambassador to my knowledge.  All were very intelligent, all very well informed, but after having been at Yale for four years I wasn't overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  While you were there were you given a choice of where you woulgo?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, here I was with a brand new masters degree in the Middle East and so I put down Beirut and Tehran and things like that.  I don't know if this was true with you, Stu, but there was a rule that you had to pass a so-called world language test of which there were four or five I think, and if you didn't pass that you had to go to a post that spoke one of those languages and become more adept at it.  The closest I came to passing, which was a 3/3 was a 2/2 in Spanish.  So, they said, “Ah, you've got to go to a Spanish speaking post.  The Middle East, forget it.”  So, this great day arrived and somebody came in from personnel with this list of assignments and everybody held their breath.  It came to Myles Greene, me, and they said, “Ciudad Juarez”, Texas more or less.  The Mexican border.  Everybody chuckled and my good friend, Joe Leaky, who was in this class, got Vigo, Spain which is very nice, but later they said, “Oh, sorry Joe, you're going to Ciudad Juarez, too.”  So, he and I went together and the four of us, his wife and my wife, have since then been very, very close friends.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Ciudad Juarez, you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  From the summer of '56 to the summer of '58 and amazingly enough it was a very positive experience.  Most people, now I don't know if that's true, a lot of people have good memories of their first posts.  This is a very unusual place.  It was not really as an old time FSO who was there said, this isn't really the Foreign Service.  There was no other consulate there.  There was across the border in El Paso, a Mexican consulate general and we were an American consulate general on our side.  There were a couple of negative aspects, mainly the two bosses I had one of whom was an old line FSO on his last assignment, named Brown.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Sure, sure.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
<p>GREENE:  To put it mildly, Brown drank too much.  He would go home for lunch and could hardly focus during the afternoon.  Then he retired and my second year there was the days of McCarthy.  The new CG was a right wing McCarthyist who had been in the State Department security and felt very strongly about protecting the State Department from communism and all that sort of thing.  I'll never forget once the ambassador to Mexico, his name I don't remember, visited the consulate and we had a reception. This guy Drury, our boss, the consul general, said, “I want to look around this room and see everyone of you with a glass of tomato juice in your hand, nothing hard to drink during this reception.  Behave yourselves.”  That was really bad.  Anyway, that's the negative part.  But, we set all that aside, namely with two bosses.  We had a great time there.  When we first arrived we joined three other Americans living on the Mexican side.  By the time those three left, we were the only ones from the consulate living on the Mexican side.  We had a marvelous house, $96 a month, two maids, we had another baby while we were there and I lived a block and a half from the consulate.  We got to know a lot of people, but we didn't travel much because of these babies.  I was invited to join the local rotary club, which was an interesting experience. Our landlord was the mayor of Juarez and our next door neighbor was a major merchant.  So, we had a lot of fun, we really enjoyed it.  The other positive element was, despite what I said about these two bosses, I was given the opportunity to rotate among jobs in the Consulate.  I don't know if that was an official policy in those days for a new FSO, but was it?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I don't think it was as structured as it is now, that came little later.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I did spend roughly six months each on immigrant and non-immigrant visas.  I spent another six months on American protection, passports and that sort of thing.  I had the jail run every morning.  That was quite an experience.  Another four or five months during miscellaneous things.  I did some commercial reporting.  It so happened there was a presidential election while I was there, a Mexican presidential election, which of course was meaningless at that time because the same party always won.  But the opposition candidate was from our consular district and so I dug around about him and wrote a long sort of biographic report about him.  It was a lot of fun.  I really feel very positive about those two years.  So, does my wife.  She enjoyed it, too.</p>
<p>Q:  Let's talk first about the visitor, visitor visa, immigrant visa.  What was the situation vis-�-vis on Mexicans on the border and going to the United States at that time?</p>
<pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I take a little credit for what was going on in that consulate.  The guy I replaced, an old line FSO, was just plain mean to most applicants.  I'm talking about immigrant visas.  I tried to be much more understanding, but there was lots of divided families, lots of economic reasons for considering immigrant visas and I'm sure in the end I was more generous than others.  Non-immigrant visas were a bit confused because just a couple of miles down the road the immigration service at the border which had these so-called border crossing cards which they used at that time, so there was confusion as to what we were giving non-immigrant visas for.  This was mostly for people who were going somewhere beyond El Paso and it was pretty cut and dry.  There would be this mob of people there every morning, a line waiting outside the door of the consulate from 6:00 AM to try to get in.  The non-immigrant visa room would be jammed.  People would get numbers and you'd call the numbers and just check a little bit about their background, why, where were they going and this sort of thing.  Almost always we said okay.  We did not have much of a watch list such as consular officers are supposed to be using now.  We had a little bit of that, but not a great deal.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They're called a lookout book, which was printed, but realldidn't have.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.</p>
<p>Q:  What about Juarez as being one of those places where Americans who live in Texas and all go to whoop it up and so I mean what about protection and welfare there?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Let me just say first of all, this was long before the current situation which involves more than a million people and assembly plants for many American products. At that time, yes, the main street in Juarez was filled with bars, brothels, various things like that.  Almost every night somebody would either be picked up by the police or else pushed back across the border.  So, one of the most important duties of somebody in the consulate, for a while it was me, was to know the chief of police and be known when you walked into as the guy from the American consulate.  I'll never forget this man.  He was really friendly.  I enjoyed him.  He would sit behind a desk with three or four people standing in front of him, each for three or four different reasons, and he would speak and turn to one after the other or sometimes jump back and forth. I would tell him how I understood that Joe Smith was in there and he'd say, “Okay, just a minute” and then he'd go talk about somebody else to somebody else.  The conditions in the jail were just miserable, really bad, but it was our duty to not only to see these people, usually it was just drunkenness or something like that, but if they had something more serious, we'd try to contact a family member to tell them about lawyers.  I hate to say it was fun, but it was.  I would never have wanted to be in that place as a prisoner I must say.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about in the jails for example, drugs weren't a big deal ithose days?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
<p>GREENE:  No, drinking was though, and whoring as they call it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, those things are usually taken care of by you know a nighin the jail and send them on their way.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, well, there were a few people who were drinking and had stolen something from a store.  There were tourist shops selling Mexican products of various sorts.  I'm trying to remember if I, I don't recall any really serious crime while I was there like murder.  I know there was one case in our consular district in a much smaller town down on the border where an American got in trouble for robbery, a more serious crime and the number two person in the consulate and I went there to see.  This is about a 50-mile drive or so.  A couple of times I went to Chihuahua which was the state capital to see Americans there, too.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you find the justice system?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I think most of what I would call justice was, to put it personally, was my connection with the police chief.  He thought I was there to just see what was going on with Joe Smith.  He would say, “Well, he's sobering up, give him another day or so” something like this, that was justice.  But occasionally there would be something a little more and I don't remember any egregious problems with the justice system. This is all very small-scale stuff you know?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were they having any problems on the other side of the border,which reflected on your operation?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes and no.  There was something called the Mexican American Border Commission, which had headquarters in El Paso.  The Chairman was a presidential appointee and he always thought he outranked the consul general and everybody else around there.  This was during the Eisenhower administration.  He happened to have been in the army with Eisenhower and thus had his connections.  That was a problem and of course there was this very large Mexican American community in El Paso.  The mayor of El Paso was the first Mexican American to be elected to that position.  I can't say as a vice consul I saw him often, but I would see him.  He understood the problems.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did your wife find this?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, my wife loved it.  As I say, we had our second child there.  We had good friends and I would say of our various Foreign Service posts that was her favorite, believe it or not.  We always had one maid and when the second child was born for a brief period, we had two maids and it looked like a slave system.  We had a little room up in the roof of the house where this maid lived.  My wife participated in various things, the women's side of the rotary club and things like that.  She didn't know as much Spanish as I did, but she knew quite a bit and it was a very positive experience for us, really.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were there from '56 to?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The summer of '56 to the summer of '58.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The summer of '58 and then what?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  There was then what was called the April Fool's form.  I had expressed myself again for the Middle East, having in the meantime passed the Spanish exam.  I was assigned to Tehran which was fine with me.  I believe it was my first choice or second choice after Beirut.  It's amazing to look back now at the size of the embassy.  The political section in Tehran then was like seven or eight honest FSOs.  What in the world everybody did is beyond me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, particularly under that type of government.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  Anyway, arrived with another guy; we were the twjunior members of this group.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, yes.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
<p>GREENE: My job involved miscellaneous things which I don't think anybody paid any attention to now.  I was the biographic officer, the photographic officer, various things to do with the internal justice system.  I remember my temporary boss, John Bowling, wanted everyone in the political section to be working on some background airgram or dispatch, which it was called then, looking into some institution or aspect of Iranian society.  I did two things.  One was the ministry of interior system and the other was the Jewish community of Tehran.  I got to see a couple of senior rabbis there and I wrote my report.  Whether anybody ever paid any attention to it I have no idea, but it was interesting.  So, I had these miscellaneous duties, it was okay, but not as exciting as the consular work in Mexico.  My wife had a hard time there.  It was a difficult post for her.  Tehran was still, well, not quite primitive, but very much a backward place at that time.  There was no embassy housing.  We stayed in one of Tehran's finer hotels which wasn't very nice to say the least and while I was working it was up to her to be with these two children, one of whom contracted measles while in the hotel, and find us a place to live.  You had to fight through the embassy motor pool to get somebody to drive you around to look at houses.  This was during the winter by then and there were not too many choices of food.  I'll never forget we, early on, we were invited to, the political counselor was away, to his wife's house for lunch and my wife, Tina, was chatting away.  “Gee it's going to be wonderful to have something other than potatoes and carrots,” but we had potatoes and carrots, which was all they had in the way of vegetables there.  Anyway, it was hard for her.  We eventually got a place to live, which was okay.  Everything was, what we would now say fairly primitive living.  There was a guy there in another agency who was very wealthy and he got a house that had linoleum. It was considered an absolute sensation in Tehran to have someone with linoleum floors.  My wife took some classes and got involved in the Iran-American Society and fought her way through several maids trying to find one that would work out.  We had various things stolen from us by a couple of them.  In the neighborhood she sometimes wore shorts, a no-no.  She didn't like it.  Let's put it that way.  In those days Foreign Service efficiency reports mentioned wives and my report said my wife was unhappy and uncomfortable in the place.  I'm not sure uncomfortable was correct, but she was unhappy and it was hard on her.  As the years have passed and people have asked about the Foreign Service, I have said that I have had a lot of good experiences, but it's very hard on the family.  It certainly was there at that time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  His name was Wailes.  Old-line good Foreign Service guy and Frazier Wilkins was the DCM at that time.  They lived not too far from us and we liked them.  Although Wilkins later went elsewhere and Stuart Rockwell became the DCM, a very stiff guy to say the least.  We didn't like him much.  Wailes was fine, but you know he was the ambassador and we were lowly political officers there.  I'll never forget one morning he came into my office for some reason and he said, “What a night.  I was invited to seven parties last night and got to only five.”  I thought oh, that's the life of an ambassador.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  With seven political officers, what the devil?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: What did we all do?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I mean, you know, particularly at that time, there reallweren't political parties.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  There were political parties, there was something called a Mardom party which was the Shah's party in effect.  Well, we had the counselor and his deputy.  The deputy did a lot of so-called political reporting.  It was at one point Bob Schact and another point was Frank Crawford whom I mentioned.  We had one guy whose main job was protocol officer, to meet and greet people.  We had duties that I just described for myself.  The protocol officer once had a message from Eisenhower to the Shah which he forgot where he put.  He couldn't remember where it was and it hadn't been delivered. His career didn't last very long.  We also had a CENTO officer.  There was a Central Treaty Organization at that time in which Iran was a member.  We also had a political military officer.  That later became a separate section for political military.  That's more or less everybody I think.</p>
<p>Q:  When you got there you were sort of the new boy looking at this.  What was the impression you were getting from your fellow officers who had been there longer of the Shah?</p>
<p>GREENE:  With one exception they all followed the party line, the U.S. policy, namely he was a valuable ally and we would stick by his limitations that he placed on our activities.  Once in a while the Shah would say to our ambassador, “What was that guy from your embassy doing talking to so and so?”  Obviously following us.  So, we were very much under clamps.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, in many ways you weren't, I mean this is a theme that wafollowed up through 1978 or so?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes,  I will have something more to say about that later,but I want to tell you about Tehran later.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But you were aware of that even then?  When you were doing thministry of the interior did this include SAVAK?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, definitely not.  We had CIA there at the time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Okay, so.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, there was something else I wanted to mention about Iran.  Despite this very positive experience in Mexico, I really had not been in the Foreign Service.  Mexico was an unusual place on the border there.  In Tehran, I was not given much guidance, to put it mildly.  The head of the political section, whose name I can't remember, I met him briefly once, was a great expert on disarmament and had been called to Geneva to be the deputy head of our talks on some disarmament issue and was gone for months on end.  By the time he came back he had been reassigned, so we never really had a full time head of the section there.  John Bowling, who was acting and was a real expert on Iran and that whole area of the world, was a busy guy.  He took some time to take me to a few of his meetings with senators or whatever just to see what it was like.  Nobody ever said, “Okay, Myles, you're new and these are some things you should do or pay attention to.”  Nobody really said whether the biographic files were good or bad or incomplete or what should we do.  I was surprisingly much on my own and partly because of the lack of time for a head of the section.  Then Harry Schwartz came along as the head of section after this nameless man, who I can't remember, the disarmament man left. Harry Schwartz was much more hand's on, but by then I had settled into my own routines and didn't really need his guidance so much.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was the situation with the Jews in Iran at that time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The Jews, the situation was really amazingly good as a matter of fact.  They had two guaranteed places in the parliament which of course didn't' have much power.  They ran a number of the really big businesses.  Many of the rug shops were Jewish owned.  I remember when I was there later at the time of the revolution and a lot of the Jews were leaving to go to Israel because the Shah had fallen and Khomeni was coming.  I went around to see if I could find some rug bargains as the shops were breaking up.  No way, they were going to take it all to Israel with them.  They were not reducing prices at all.  They were generally accepted.  Some of them were quite prominent, and there were some senior people around the Shah who supposedly had been Jews at one time and had declared themselves Muslims.  So, I would say, considering the glass ceiling in some American companies on women, that for the Jews who did not want to become prime minister or something really senior, it was a pretty good life.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you see corruption around, was that a problem?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I didn't, to tell you the truth, no.  I'm sure it was there.  There was this great project going on to build what was known as the royal country club and the guy clearly paid to get the contract happens to be a very prominent contractor here in town right now.  Yes, but honestly I was not aware of that.  When I would do a biographic report on someone about whom nothing had ever been written, I would go around to people in the American community, the official American community usually and ask them what they knew about this man and this sort of thing.  Some of them did say, yes, he's corrupt, but in terms of details, I didn't know.</p>

<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there any stirrings of political life there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Iranian political life?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  This was only '58.  Some of the Mossadegh officials who had been overthrown, with our help, were still around.  There was a junior FSO in Isfrahan who was the outstanding person in the FSO community saying that, “You know we should find all these pro-Mossadegh people.  We should support them.  That was a big mistake on our part to help overthrow this man.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Bill Miller.  He later became ambassador to the Ukraine, after quitting the Foreign Service and coming back in.  Bill Miller was not popular in the FSO community because he was so against the system and so pro the previous system that we had helped to overthrow.  But most FSOs acceptedthe system.  It was a big deal to go to the Shah's birthday every year.  A certain number of people at the embassy would get to go and we all passed around the few white tie and tails that were there which you had to wear for this occasion and that gave you a buzz to do that.  The Shah was remarried while we were there to Farah Dubor, who remained his wife until his death. The wedding procession and the Rolls Royces all went right in front of the American embassy.  That was something that we all remember.  So, I guess we were just fitting into the system as spelled out by the administration here.  This was a friend of ours, a valuable ally, and we should do business with him.</p>
<p>Q:  Did you ever have anybody in the political section say, “Well, we don't want to report on that?” Or something, “That's kind of disturbing” or something of that nature?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No.  I remember a few occasions where there was some subjects, I don't remember what they were, and somebody like the DCM would say, “Oh, let the CIA handle that.”  That was a way of saying, don't get into that whatever it was.  Some of my best friends I might say, since I mentioned the CIA, were in the CIA.  I used to say that Iranians surely knew the difference between us and them because they all had drivers, which we did not have.  We drove our own cars.  Two or three of these people, one just died recently, are good friends of ours.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any monitoring of the religious life there at the time?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
<p>GREENE:  Not really.  I'll answer that better when I mention my next tour in Iran, which was some years later, but basically this is the kind of thing that if somebody from the embassy called on a mullah or any ayatollah and eventually the Shah would know about it.  We didn't do that sort of thing.  So, no, as we learned 20 years later, we did not know much about what was going on in the religious community.  At that time there was one FSO who happened to be unusually fluent in Farsi who had some religious connections, I wasn't there when he was there.  During the months before, during and after the Shah fell, this guy, Stan Escudero, was brought back from his Washington assignment to reestablish some of his contacts.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, then you left there in '88?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The very end of '88, yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Anything happen while you were there?  Turmoil, presidentiavisits?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, yes, Eisenhower came.  That was turmoil enough.  As somebody in his party, in Eisenhower's party, said, “Well, this is the third embassy in a row that we've torn apart.”  You know how it is when a presidential group arrives.  Yes, Eisenhower came, that was exciting.  I had fairly menial duties to do with members of his party although I did shake the great man's hand, but he was mostly with the ambassador and then with the Shah.  Years later, well, not too many years later as a matter of fact, I came back with one of these groups myself on the other side with then Vice President Lyndon Johnson,  I could see how we tore the embassy apart.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In '88 whither?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  What's that?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In '88 whither, where did you go?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '58.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I mean '58.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
<p>GREENE:  I had filled out the usual April Fool's form and had asked for a couple of other places in the Middle East and also asked for Arabic training in Beirut and was accepted for that.  We came home on home leave.  Both our families lived in Florida, so it was a very pleasant home leave and then we went at the very beginning of '59 to Beirut.  My wife, it's hard to say, I'm not a psychiatrist, but really had a breakdown growing out of her unhappiness in Tehran and without going into the details of her illness, this greatly complicated my assignment to learn Arabic.  Eventually the wise people in personnel back in Washington decided I should break the assignment and come back, which I did.  My wife was put on what was then called, some designation like A or B or C hat meant you couldn't be assigned back overseas without medical approval.  Anyway, so I wasn't in Beirut very long, seven months or so.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, then you came back to Washington?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  We came back to Washington unexpectedly, and I had the marvelous good luck of encountering one of the greatest bosses I have ever worked for, Bob Minor, who was then the director of what was known as Greece, Turkey and Iran.  This was the so-called Truman Doctrine era of our interests overseas; and John Bowling, who I mentioned had been in Tehran with me for awhile, was the Iranian desk officer.  So, I helped John while people tried to figure out what to do with me and Bob Minor one day came in and said, “Would you like to be the number two person on the Turkish desk?”  This is the way it happened.  I said, “It sounds really good.  I've never served in Turkey.”  He said, I'll never forget it, “Oh, it doesn't matter, as long as you know your way around this building here.”  So, I became the number two and often the number one on Turkish affairs within this office of Greece, Turkey, Iran and Cyprus.  For three years and it was a very good assignment.  I enjoyed it an awful lot.  Many things happened.  I went to Turkey several times on business.  The Cyprus war broke out while I was there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were there from '89 to about, I mean '59 to '60?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, no, no, let's see.  '60 was the year when I really didn't have an assignment, I was helping out on the Iran desk.  So, basically I was the number two on the Turkish desk from late '61 to early '65.  It was three full years.  The Turkish desk at that time was made up of three people, the desk officer, political officer and an economic officer.  I was the political officer, which was normally considered the number two job, although the economic officer outranked me in terms of Foreign Service rank.  I spent an awful lot of time with cables back and forth to Ankara and other places in Turkey.  I got very involved with military affairs in Turkey because it was a NATO member of course.  We had a large military involvement with a status of forces agreement which resulted in all kinds of problems with American soldiers who got in trouble there.  I also wrote endless position papers for higher levels of the State Department to use when they saw the foreign minister or ambassador or whatever.  I will never forget one occasion with Dean Rusk. I don't know why he decided to have breakfast with the Turkish ambassador, but I sat in with the two of them for breakfast; I didn't eat much.  At the end of the breakfast, Secretary Dean Rusk said, “Well, there's the sofa, come on over here.”  He whipped out this paper from his briefcase, which was my briefing paper, classified secret.  He said, “Let's read this together and see what we're supposed to talk about.”  So, the two of them, the Turkish foreign minister and our Secretary of State, went through my paper and decided what they should say on each subject.  That was enlightening to me.  But I did a lot of that sort of thing.  I became very involved with the people in the Turkish embassy here in town.  They had a very generous ambassador who didn't mind the fact that I was not the senior officer and saw me and invited me to events.  It was fun.  I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Q:  Speaking of the Turkish embassy, one of the interesting things is to look at various embassies and how they act within Washington.  I mean, some embassies know how to play the Washington game and others don't.  How at that time, during the late '50s, early '60s would you rate them?</p>
<p>GREENE:  The Turkish embassy played very heavily on the military link between us and them and tried their best to use this to counter the two negative aspects of being the Turkish ambassador.  One the fact that there was Greece right next door plus there are a lot of Greek Americans here and secondly, Armenians, American Armenians and those were big headaches for me as well as to the Turkish ambassador.  But, he was good.  He knew a lot of members of congress.  His name was Memencioglu, an old Turkish Ottoman family, very distinguished, very well educated, perfect English, all those things that ambassadors are supposed to be.  He had a wide range of contacts in town. But I should say he certainly did not succeed in outweighing the Greek community here.  There aren't that many voting Turks.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did the State Department take the stand on the vote to condemTurkey by Armenia?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh absolutely.  We opposed it.  We said this is a valuable ally.  That event (the death of many Armenians during World War I) was regretted, but it was long ago.  It should not be called genocide, which is what the resolution said it should be called.  That's what we said publicly and we said privately to many members of congress that this would do serious damage to the U.S. Turkish relations and U.S. Turkish relations are extremely important, because Turkey next to the U.S. had the largest military force in NATO.  It was our link to farther east into the Middle East area.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, did you find you were within the GTI as it was called?  Did you find that you and your Turkish desk officers were sort of at lauger heads and all that?  I mean the Americans who were Greek.</p>
<p>GREENE:  The pro-Greeks and the pro-Turks?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Pro-Turks.  I mean was there sort of an undercurrent there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, after my great friend, Bob Minor, went on to be ambassador and he was succeeded by what was then the senior woman in the Foreign Service, Kate Bracken, who was famous for being pro-Greek.  I'll go into that in a minute, but there was this event in Cuba and what the implications were for Turkey and missiles.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, this was October '62?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  There was this very mean letter written to the Turks about the fact that we were considering taking their Jupiter missiles out as a balance for getting the Russians to take their missiles from Cuba and everybody referred to it as Kate Bracken's letter.  She didn't write it at all, but they just assumed so since she was anti-Turk.  The Turks said, “Oh, that was that Bracken woman.”  But, it wasn't, it was Bob Komer in the White House who wrote the letter.  Anyway, the Cuba crisis was interesting from the viewpoint of being this poor number two on the Turkish desk.  All these high level things were going on and practically nobody in the State Department beyond the Secretary and George Ball and a few other people knew that Turkey was part of the negotiations.  We on the desk didn't know about it at the time; nobody told us about exchanging the Jupiter missiles we have in Turkey to keep the Russians happy, the Soviets happy.  How low down in the State Department this news went, I don't know, but certainly nowhere near where I was at the time.  It was certainly enlightening after it was over to realize that we were involved.</p>
<p>Q:  How did you find within the, did you get any feel for the importance of Turkey in NEA, I mean were Israel and its neighbors sort of occupied most of the time?</p>
<pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
<p>GREENE:  In terms of the three parts of NEA at that time, GTI was number two.  The Arab Israeli people were clearly number one and South Asia, which at that time was part of NEA, was clearly at the bottom of the heap.  We got part of the attention.  Bob Minor, my original office director had a lot of experience in Turkey and Greece and he let people know about Turkey.  You don't remember it so much now, but the military connection with Turkey was extremely important at that time.  Turkey was next to the Soviet Union; it had a large military force, an enormous amount of military assistance we gave them, thousands of American military personnel of various sorts were there.  It was important in terms of the total American involvement more important than Greece, but the Greek American community counterbalanced that easily.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did you feel any competition with Greece over funds or was thapretty well set, that ratio?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, it was pretty well set.  The only time that I remember any rivalry was when Arch Bishop Makarios, the president of Cyprus, came on a State visit.  Carl Coor, who was the Cyprus desk officer, couldn't handle all this by himself, so a couple others, one from the Greek desk, one from the Turkish desk helped him out for a while.  There was clearly some rivalry there.  Frazier Wilkins, who was ambassador, told Makarios very politely that we were discontinuing Congressional speeches by state visitors and Makarios said, “What you mean to say is I'm the first being dropped?”  At which point, the Greek American community spoke up and he did speak at congress.  So, there was a considerable Greek Turkish element in that visit.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was the political situation inside Turkey during this time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, it seems like ancient history now, but Turkey was still dominated by what was known as the Republican Peoples Party into the '50s followed y the Democrat Party and then there had been a military coup in '59.  The RPP took over and eventually the new Justice Party.  So, we were just beginning to feel our way into this developing situation.  Basically Turkey remained a military controlled country with a thin coating of democracy.  The prime minister, Ismet Inonu, who had been Ataturk's deputy, was prime minister for a lot of years after that.  One time I went to Turkey during the Cyprus crisis on the presidential plane, Air Force One, to bring Ismet Inonu, who was quite old, back to talk to Lyndon Johnson.  The American ambassador, Raymond Hare was worried about such an elderly man flying back to Washington.  Basically Turkey was still under the system dominated by the military and the old provincial elite, and trying to come into power was this new group which did squeeze in for a while, but was overthrown by the military and eventually came back, but that's another story.</p>
<p>Q:  No, I read a book recently which about a correspondent or something, which it talked about Turkey as still having the problem of getting away from the anti-Turk complex.  The army is there to protect and even though you've got a whole new generation coming in and all, you're unable to give up this power of taking over.</p>
<pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
<p>GREENE:  The military leader considers they are the ultimate protectors of the Ataturk position and if a prime minister or any other senior person seems to be moving the country away from that and away from being a secular nation it is their duty to intervene which they have done on three or maybe four times since 1958.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it seems to be a reverse image of Iran today where yohave a religious group that sits and you know.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not quite that much, but I would say it's the same.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But there seems to be something there.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: The military in Turkey, first of all they are modern, they are often American-trained and you're speaking to people with whom we do business, as opposed to the Ayatollah in Iran.  If the Turkish military don't like the way things are going, they overthrow the government.  I noticed in the paper today that a man named Erbakan, who is the only person of the right wing Muslim party ever to be elected prime minister and was eventually overthrown by the military, and he is now, been found guilty of having stolen two and a half million dollars from his party's treasury.  The military's finger is still on these people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were we making any noises about what today would be called humarights?  This was back in the early '60s.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not really, I mean the Kurds, for example, should have been more important.  We didn't hear much about them..  I think we assisted the Turks some in building more modern prison systems.  I know there was a person when I was in Izmir, which we really haven't discussed, that was called the Buca Hilton, a modern prison.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there did the movie Lawrence of Arabia come out?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: No, I think that was after.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It was in that period, but it might have been a little later, but that caused a.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
<p>GREENE:  Horrible about the homosexuals.  They were Ottomans of course.  The Turks don't like to say they're Ottomans, they're Turks, they're Turks in the Turkish expression which means “we resemble ourselves.”  There's nobody else in the world like us.  We are Turks.  That's true.  There aren't any other people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you seeing a growing group of young Turks who were gettintrained in the United States or were they still going more to Germany?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, no, the English language was increasingly important.  Old people knew some German, but no, you could go into surprising small towns in Turkey and discover people who spoke English.  I will never forget, we did a lot of traveling.  On vacations we'd travel around.  Once we arrived in the middle of nowhere in southern Turkey and the car broke down and a guy came along on a motorcycle.  I spoke pretty good Turkish and I said, “I obviously don't understand this.  All I know is that the car won't work.”  He said, “Hop on the motorcycle, there's a good mechanic in the next town, I'll take you there” which he did.  I walked up to this guy, the mechanic, and started speaking what I thought was good Turkish and he came back in beautiful English.  He had lived in the state of Montana for 15 years as a miner and returned to Turkey.  So, you could find people like this all over the place.  The present prime minister was a graduate of Robert College.  He has translated works of various sorts from English into Turkish, Shakespeare for example.  Turks, unlike their neighbors on the east and west, that is the Greeks and the Iranians, are not prima donnas.  The Turks are warm-hearted people who enjoyed being friendly to Americans and thus set aside any tradition that had come before us.</p>
<p>Q:  When you were on the desk during this '61 to '65 period, did you get involved much in problems with American troops there or was this taken care of pretty well by the Pentagon people?</p>
<pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, it was dependent on the degree of the problem.  We were renewing and trying to expand our status of forces agreement with Turkey during the time I was there and, although the Pentagon certainly had some strong views on the subject, I had a lot to do with my opposite member in ISA which is a part of the Pentagon, so I certainly got into that, but in terms of specific cases, unless there was American political pressure having to do with some American who was in trouble there, we didn't get into it very much.  One of the most famous cases was this American sergeant who smuggled things.  The Ottoman empire had this ancient tradition of not sending people to jail so much, but sending them out in the countryside living in restricted area in a village somewhere.  This American was sent to a small town on the Aegean coast which nobody had ever heard of.  He was there two or three years and became an effective director of tourism there and made it into a famous place for foreign tourists.  The local citizens begged him to stay after the sentence was over.  Some people at the State Department were questioning what are we doing having this guy, who is a criminal, running tourism out there in this lovely little town on the Aegean.  So, that was my job on the desk.  I was the political officer.  I did handle other political military stuff, but most of it was in the Pentagon.  Something that I learned much later was that, in terms or the legal requirements for the approval of military sales, with certain countries where the approval process was pretty routine.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Fives probably these were a smaller version.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  F-5s, they were F-5s.  There was no question that we wergoing to approve it.  I'll tell you some more about that later.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, did you notice was there any change in our policy when you were there when Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson took over.  Did that make any difference?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No.  The Turks were proud of the fact that Johnson as Vice President had been there.  Kennedy had never been there.  No.  I don't think so.  The same senior people were still involved.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well in '65 it was time to.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, at the time, I actually, late '64 my wife had clearance then from these medical people to go back overseas and I began to think what should I do.  Several people said after all this you really should go to Turkey.  Usually you become desk officer after having been in the country and in this case it would be the reverse.  I said that I like that. I certainly by then was pretty knowledgeable and I said I'll take some Turkish if that's approved and then I would like to go to Turkey.  So I did and I took most of the basic full time course in Turkish at which was used to be FSI, over in Rosslyn.  Then I put in a bid for two or three positions in Turkey and got one of them, the number two job in Izmir which I can talk about if you're interested?</p>
<pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Absolutely.  You were in Izmir from when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '66 to '68.  The consulate doesn't even exist anymore.  That's another sign of the times, but at that time we had seven Americans.  I was the number two and the job was really in two parts.  One was that I was the political person.  Of course Izmir was a place unto itself in terms of politics.  So, I also spent a lot of time trying to keep up with the American military community, trying to make them behave in terms of the local Turkish situation.  The Cyprus crisis was still going on and there was an almost war between Greece and Turkey.  In '67 we had blackouts along the coast, and I established a sort of what we would call a country team of USIS and several different military commands which included land Southeast NATO headquarters.  I chaired that group and we tried to coordinate the local response to the crises.  I also was on several occasions the principal officer there and I knew a lot of people and I think I was respected.  I was asked to be, I told you I had been in the rotary club in Mexico, in the Lions Club in Izmir, so I had a lot of business connections through that.  I wrote a lot of political reporting from there.  I also, believe it or not, more or less ran the American pavilion at the annual Izmir trade fair, so I had a lot of things going on.  One time when I was acting principal officer the Pope came to Izmir.  I can't quite tell you why, but he did, so I got to meet him on several occasions during that time.  It was sort of exciting.  Of course Ambassador Pete Hart during that time came down on a number of occasions.  He liked Izmir.  He liked to come down there and be more relaxed than he could be in Ankara.  So, it was a good job and my wife was well and we had, by the time we got there, four children.  We arrived in Izmir by boat from Naples sort of our last little vacation in the Italian passenger line that we were on pulled up to the dock at Izmir literally one block from the American consulate.  Several of our children grew up in Turkey more or less.  Izmir was a good assignment and the fascinating things going on there for nonofficial duty, archaeology and beaches and interesting people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What were the politics of Izmir as contrasted say to Ankara or tIstanbul?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Izmir, first of all, was on the coast, a port with an old and established what they call a Levantine community and so was much more outward looking than Ankara which was very Turkish.  They were much more open to seeing Turkey's part of the world, recognizing the importance of its NATO headquarters there.  I don't think Ankara is really that way at all.  In politics I know that area of Turkey had produced one Turkish prime minister who was overthrown by the military, Menderes was his name, and therefore that area was known as not quite safe politically.  It was more business oriented, more outwardly internationalist, less ingrown than much of the rest of Turkey.  An interesting place, it really was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you able to make good contacts within the political ocommercial part in that area?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, I was.  Certainly in Izmir, partly due to my membership in the Lions Club I got to meet a lot of people.  That was business people mostly.  I took a number of field trips.  Our consular district was the whole western third of Turkey, which is pretty big, and I was a little nervous about my Turkish having just come straight from FSI there.  So, on the first two or three trips I took our senior local employee with me.  Then I very bravely went off on my own with a driver during my second year in Izmir - a number of business trips out there on my own and met mayors and governors and carried on business in Turkish. I was pleased with that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in poppy growing and that sort of thing?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not in Izmir, but I sure did in Ankara.  This was, of course, I went from Izmir in '66 to '68 I then went to Ankara as the internal political officer.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, sticking to the Izmir period, did you get involved isocial security benefits because?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  How do you know all these things?</p>
<p>Q:  Well, I was consul general a couple of years later in '70 to '74 in Athens and we had a social security man Butch Korns and we used to come back and raise our hair by telling stories of going out and talking to the local social security war lords out in there.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, this is all eastern, mostly eastern Turkey, under the consulate in Adana. There wasn't that much in our area.  It was a large scandal in eastern, mostly southeastern Turkey and for the consul there this was a major headache.  There all these people who were dead who were still getting checks.  No, we had some consular activities and a few jail problems and things like that, but in terms of social security, no.</p>
<p>Q:  Did you get any reflections of the Greeks going toIzmir after 1922, I mean did this sort of historic event when the Greeks were expelled from there?  Was that still lingering on?</p>
<pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, yes, most definitely.  One of the houses we considered renting when we arrived there, there was a lovely old waterfront house on the main kornish that had been given to Inonu by the city of Smyrna or Izmir in thanks for his leading troops to rescue the town from the terrible Greeks.  The house was in such bad shape that we didn't take it, but it was still noted that this was Inonu's house, a gift because he had defeated the Greeks.  People who read Hemingway's report about the Smyrna fire and the Greeks on the ships off the coast.  There had been, as you probably know from Athens, an exchange of population.  Thus we had in the consulate among the Turkish employees one fellow whose parents came from Greece or what we then called Greece and we also had a guy who was basically a Cypriot, but lived in Turkey.  We were certainly aware of all this at the time.  In my time there were Greek officers in the NATO headquarters in Izmir and, as far as I know, they got along okay.</p>
<p>Q:  This was sort of at the height of the '60s where an awful lot of young Americans were taking the summer or the year off and then heading off into Nepal, Afghanistan picking up hashish along the way and getting arrested often in Turkey.  Did this impact on you all?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not the latter part, not getting arrested, but we did have a good number of young Americans passing through.  They loved the beaches and there was hashish floating around, but I wouldn't say it was a major problem there.  I think the flow of that kind of person was more eastern from Istanbul across Anatolia into Iran and on toward Nepal or whatever.  Not many of them turned south along the coast.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did Cyprus play much of a role while you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, yes, I said that there was almost a war between Greece and Turkey in '67 I think it was.  We had a blackout period and the American military was very much on alert for its own protection. As usual with American military, it way over reacted in terms of the things that they were doing in trying to protect themselves.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there any reflection where you were of the Jews '67 war iIsrael Palestine?  I mean that didn't send any repercussions?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, no.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about was there anything equivalent to a communist party?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, never, nor was there ever after that.  What we call in English the Republican Peoples Party, which was Ataturk's and Inonu's party was sort of left wing in a very traditional way, but communists?  No.</p>
<pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Any equivalent to a guerrilla movement or a terrorist movement?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't really know what may have been going on in southeast Turkey among the Kurds, but I didn't hear about it if there was anything going on.  Of course that subject has gotten much more publicity in the last few years, but at that time, there was not.</p>
<p>Q:  How did we with the Kurds you know there was a time when some people at least the Turks were calling them the Mountain Turks and all that, I mean, were we looking at, in the first place, were there Kurds in your consular district?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I mean maybe a few.</p>
<p>Q:  I mean this wasn't.</p>
<p>GREENE:  No.  The only thing we had in the way of a minority was this so-called Levatine community which in many cases had been there for generations, but still held on to their British, French, Italian, Maltese or whatever passports, but no Kurds.  There may have been some people who once way back in generations before then been Kurds, but this was not significant.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about the American military?  Did the consulate, it was consulate general, wasn't it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, it was.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Spend a good bit of time, you know sort of monitoring to maksure that relations were good with them?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  That's what I said about this sort of country team that I set up during part of the Cyprus crisis and certainly the consul general and the either three or four star American general at NATO headquarters had a lot to do with each other, saw a lot of each other.  My contact level was with colonels and I saw a lot of them; generally we got along well.  I don't think they were impressed by the fact that I knew more about Turkey than they did and could speak the language.  They would listen to what I said.  One time at Cigli Air Base, which was out on the north side of Izmir its commander, an American colonel, noted there was American traffic from that air base into the city of Izmir constantly.  Often in the dark on the same road there were horse-pulled or human-pulled Turkish carts of various sorts with no lights, nothing, so the colonel from the base came up with this brilliant idea of making the Turks put red reflecting tapes on the backs of their carts so we could see them and not kill them.  I didn't want to kill them either, but we weren't going to make these people put on red reflective tape.  This was the kind of problem that we would face.  In the end we didn't, we just drove more carefully.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did the coup in Greece of April of '67 have any effect on you?This is when the colonels took over.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't remember.</p>
<p>Q:  You know, in Greece when I was there a little bit later, '70 to '74, they were always looking at the Turks, but I have the feeling that the Turks weren't looking at the Greeks.</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't remember anything.  They were worried bout Cyprus,but Greece, only a traditional enemy.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did we have a USIS?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  We did.  We had a one man post there.  He and his wife became very good friends of ours.  We had a Turkish American Association.  I was on the board of the Turkish American Association representing the consulate.  Our USIS man was an old time newspaperman, so I think he did most of his work with the local press.  We also had a large American military school, commissary, church, etc. complex there, and the USIS man did some work with the American schools.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Speaking of schools, did we have much contact I assume there wasort of a university of Izmir and all that?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, not really at that time.  It developed later.  No.  There was no university there at that time.  There were what we would call some business colleges, but anybody who was going there, there weren't more than two or three universities in Turkey at that time.  One in Ankara, one in Istanbul and there was Robert College which was American of course.  We had what was called the Kiz Koleci, a girls college, which was American missionary-run, but under very strict Turkish controls.  It was an excellent school and the repercussions of having graduates of that school plus Robert College graduates around, all of whom spoke good American English and had a much better idea about the United States than anyone else around, was very important to us.  We would go to a party, a Turkish party and run into a woman who would speak beautiful English and was a product of this mission school, although they wouldn't call it that a clear plus for our side.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who was the consul general then?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, most of the time Guy Lee, who he had been what they call Wristonized in the '50s and was a quiet unassuming fellow who did a good job.  He had sweeping ideas about developing a municipality, but I don't think they went over so well.  When I was in the Lions Club, he was in the Rotary Club.  He did not speak Turkish and did not have my background on Turkey, but we got along very well and he was more than willing to delegate things to me.  He was a fine upstanding guy.  He had a daughter married to an FSO and another daughter who was herself an FSO.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  While you were there were there any sort of traumatic events?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: We didn't get into cataclysmic events in Izmir.  We had ongoing problems to do with Cyprus and relations of the American military community with the local Turkish community.  We also had an American tobacco community there, which had been there a long time oh, maybe six or seven families.  One of these men had been there forever and ever and had been accused of smuggling Turkish antiquities packed into bales of tobacco leaves.  I knew this guy well, Hallas was his name.  I called him and said, “I'm sorry to hear about this, what can I do to help?”  He said, “What you can do to help is to stay out of it.  I'll handle it.”  I'm sure he paid off somebody because he was never officially charged.  I have since known him here in the U.S. and he does have a lovely collection of Turkish antiquities.  Exactly how he got them I don't know.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  On the political side, were you doing much political reporting?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, I was.  We had Osman Kubar was the name of the mayor, a product of an American school.  He spoke good English and so he was involved with Americans.  But he was significant at the national level.  So, I became quite acquainted with the new mayor once this old one retired.  What the American official community knew about this man they knew from me.  Some of my business contacts were very interested in politics.  Through them I followed the new Justice Party.  I wrote a lot about them.  When the American DCM or the ambassador came to Izmir, I was the one who introduced him and took him to see these people.  So, yes, I was involved in politics.  I'll never forget the slight reprimand I had from the embassy.  Kosygin, the Soviet Prime Minister, came to Izmir for some reason which I cannot remember and made a speech, and saw the mayor and the governor, and did a few other things and I wrote this up very briefly in an air gram and the embassy sent me a message, “When the Soviet prime minister comes somewhere send it by cable.”  So, it was too late then.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Okay, well, I thought we'd pick this up the next time, we'll puat the end here that we've come to '68 and what did you do?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I stayed in Turkey.  I was then on home leave and was assigned as the internal political officer in the political sector in Ankara.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  All right.  One thing before, I can't remember whether, had BoDillon been there before?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  This was Bob Dillon's job.  It's the best job for that leveFSO in the whole Foreign Service.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Bob, when I interviewed him, said that coming out of Izmir, think he'd come out of Izmir.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: We'd followed the same path, yes.</p>
<p>Q:  That all of a sudden, a new political movement appeared on the scene, this was the Justice Party and he knew and so all of a sudden you know I mean he was the man.</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  Bob did an excellent job. Bob and I are still very good friends.  Yes, I followed Bob's path through both of these jobs although it wasn't exactly the same one in Izmir and there was someone in-between us named Max Berry who was my immediate predecessor in both of those jobs, Izmir and Ankara.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Okay, well we're going to pick this up in 1968 when you're off tAnkara.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
<p>GREENE:  Okay.  That's correct.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Today is March 15, the ides of March, 2002.  We're back to 196and you're going to Ankara.  You were in Ankara from when to when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  From '68 to '71.  Three years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was your job?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I was internal political officer.  When I arrived it was four-person section.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You said in the political section?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Political section, yes.  Actually there were two people who did internal affairs when I arrived, but the other one was Elaine Smith.  She's next to Bob Dillon, the world's most expert Turk.  But her job was being abolished.  Like everywhere else in the Foreign Service at that time, personnel was being reduced in numbers.  Although Elaine was there for most of my first year, most of the time, the remaining time certainly, it was a three man section, the boss, the counselor, me, or internal politics and somebody who was called external, but who basically did the foreign ministry run.  Mine was one of the two best jobs I had in the Foreign Service.  It was really a great job.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, something on this rather than, let me ask the question now, how did you find, I mean for internal affairs, I mean this is something that our station, our CIA should have in any country have a fairly good line on or should, but often there doesn't seem to be much communication with the sort of the political officers.  How did you find it at that time in Ankara?</p>
<p>GREENE:  I found them friendly.  I knew little about what they did.  I don't think any of the people I considered my contacts were also their contacts.  If they were I didn't know about it.  The two main CIA people who did the kind of thing I did, internal affairs, and I would sometimes have lunch.  We were friends, there was no doubt about that, but in terms of knowing what they did, I didn't know much about it.</p>
<pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
<p>Q:  Well, you know, there's a difference between knowing what they do or did and that of being aware of what they're finding out because obviously they're reading your stuff and it's not, sometimes it gets to be a rivalry and you know, one of the things I've picked up sometimes is that the stuff that is in the CIA which can be very good or not, but I mean it goes into the headquarters that goes through a process and maybe comes out in sort of a morphus information where the stuff we send in is fairly raw and much more timely and really both side.  The political people should be aware of some of the things they're finding out, not necessarily how they got it, but did you find much information in that context?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not so much as I can recall.  My main recollection is this was of course during that Cold War and in Turkey, being next-door to the Soviet Union and next door to Bulgaria and not too far from some other communist countries, they were much more interested in foreign affairs than domestic affairs.  During the time I was there Dubcek, who had become the liberal prime minister of Czechoslovakia, was overthrown and, to get rid of him, he was made ambassador to Turkey.  The CIA people really pounced on him and his embassy.  The CIA had a lot to do with Russian affairs, people moving around the country, this sort of thing, but in terms of what I call internal Turkish politics, I wasn't aware of that, no, not a great deal.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Okay, who was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Pete Hart was just leaving as I arrived.  He was coming back, I guess he was going to be assistant secretary.  There was a brief period with a charge - Bill Burdett who was looking for his own ambassadorship and was there for most of my first year.  Dave Cuthell was the political counselor and very much looking to move up himself.  I think he thought being political counselor was beneath him.  But we became friends.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How do you spell his name?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  C-U-T-H-E-L-L.  Dave Cuthell.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Is he retired or around?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  He's dead.  He had emphysema and died five or six years ago.  Anyway, when Bill Burdett eventually left, what happened was so normal in the Foreign Service, Dave became the DCM, that is the promotion was internal within the embassy.  Then Morris Draper came as the political counselor.  Perhaps you know him.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
<p>GREENE:  So, during this time one good reason why mine was such a terrific job was that I was really very much on my own.  Dave Cuthell knew a lot about Turkey.  He'd been in Turkey before, but in Istanbul, not Ankara.  When Draper came he didn't know a thing about Turkey and so I was it.  It was a great job.  The job being keeping up with and knowing members of parliament, the political party leaders, newspaper people, some professors, anybody to do with internal affairs.  I spoke Turkish.  By that time I had been in Turkey for two years in Izmir, my Turkish was pretty good.  We had three terrific, local employees, Foreign Service Nationals, who had all been there a long time and were well known themselves around town.  I was off to a good start with them.  I guess there are a lot of things I could say, but the main thing I did was to see a lot of people.  One of the ways I started seeing people was through any sort of award that was being given, USIS, AID or whatever, a trip to the U.S. or a trip to NATO headquarters or whatever I got involved as the embassy representative in this selection committee that would pick these people and I was the guy who delivered the letter or the invitation to them saying you are hereby invited to the United States for so and so; then I developed these people as contacts.  I would also go around to party headquarters saying, “I'm from the American Embassy.  I'd just like to come by for a visit.”  One of the three local employees was particularly knowledgeable about parliament. I would go sometimes with him to parliament just to listen to what was going on.  Of course I kept up with the newspapers through my reading which wasn't that great, and through these three local employees.  I did travel some.  This was the time of the Justice Party.  Prime Minister Demirel, I can't say I got to know him, but I knew a lot of people with him.  Pete Hart came back as assistant secretary for a while and there was some parties given for him.  Really senior people came and that was helpful.  Whenever the ambassador gave a reception which, was fairly often I was the guy who was standing at the door to pull out any political people whom somebody should know.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was the party system at that point?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The party system?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there, I mean what was the political system?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, except for the communist party and any what you might call religious party, things were wide open.  There was free vote.  So it seemed.  Then as time passed, let's see this would be in 1970, Demirel, who had increasingly moved to the right and was flirting with the religious people, was overthrown.  One of my really good contacts, whom I had more or less inherited from Bob Dillon, was Nihat Erim.  He was a traditional leader from the Republic Peoples Party, then in the opposition.  I saw him fairly regularly and he said that he would like to meet the political counselor so one night he had my wife and me and Draper and his wife and somebody else over. It was interesting that Draper's wiife claimed she could read fortunes from hands and she read Erim's lines on his hand and said, “Oh, you're soon going to be prime minister.”  Everybody smiled.  But soon he was prime minister, because when the military forced Demirel out, they wanted somebody above day-to-day politics as prime minister.  Erim was a long time leader, and the military wanted someone like this, respected, intelligent, willing to play the game according to the way the military wanted and they said okay, you are the new prime minister.  Obviously he moved out of my range at that time when he became prime minister, but interestingly enough I still saw him quite a bit because at that time this was the opium problem.  But let me go back a minute.  We'd had a brief a period of Bob Komer as ambassador.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I was going to ask you about that.  Known affectionately as thblowtorch.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, that's right.  He was nominated in Lyndon Johnson's latter months but never confirmed by the Senate.  Senate he assumed that he would be confirmed or redenominated and confirmed under the new president, Richard Nixon.  It didn't happen, but he stayed on until the spring of '69 which was about three or four months into the next administration, never having been confirmed, still wheeling and dealing.  His car was burned by the students.  He had plans to build a swimming pool in the backyard of the residence and tennis courts and invite all these people over.  None of this really happened.  He trying to be a Kennedy, developed touch football games in the embassy's backyard. He didn't pay much attention to me and I didn't think much of him, to tell you the truth.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, how did a personality like this fit into the Turkisculture at the diplomatic level, did it work?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
<p>GREENE:  I think most people knew that he was on the brink of not being there very long and therefore they didn't pay much attention to him.  He was terribly aggressive, really.  I had, let's go back, when I was on the Turkish desk I had traveled with Lyndon Johnson, then Vice President Lyndon Johnson, for three weeks through that part of the world and Bob Komer was on the plane with us.  So, I knew him; people said he was put there by the Kennedys to watch Johnson.  Who knows what he was there for?  I was delighted when he left Ankara.  Bill Handley became the next ambassador.  He had NEA experience, but no Turkish experience.  USIS background.  He was much more likeable, much more down to earth, much less of a buzz saw, although still faced with the same kind of internal problems that had led to Komer's car burning and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What were the dynamics of the, the students were sort ouniversity Marxist types?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That sort of thing. This was really the reason for Demirel's fall.  He, on the one hand, had not only moved to the right himself, but had failed to take firm action against this growing group of leftist students.  These people were particularly anti-American.  They saw us as running the country which was to a degree true.  Anything representing Washington they were against, and when the military took over in '70, the main purpose was to have somebody who would crack down on these leftists.  A few years later in the early '80s, after much of this had passed and I'd left, Nihat Erim was murdered by some leftists, sitting peacefully at home having been completely out of politics and in his retirement at a farm.  Bob Dillon was back then and was our representative to the funeral.  I was saying that in 1970-71, I continued to have some contacts with Erim even though he was prime minister and I was a lowly first secretary from the embassy.  The reason being that we were in a narcotics war against any country that produced opium or anything resembling that and Turkey was a prime example of the opium poppy grower.  Bill Handley made this his personal project and I went to all these meetings with the prime minister and was the note taker and also the fact provider.  We had a DEA person who had been added to the embassy staff, but a lot of it still involved internal Turkish politics, so I was very much involved in all of this.  In terms of publicity back in Washington poppy growing was probably the biggest thing the Turks were doing at the time.</p>
<p>I continued to maintain at my level contacts with all kinds of people.  I took a group of senior parliamentarians on a so-called NATO tour to various places, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, a couple of American bases and obviously that gang was contacts in the future.  I did take a few internal trips.  I enjoyed that a lot - into eastern Turkey, met the local politicians and wrote up what I had to say about them.  Tina and I lived in an area that was within quite easy distance from the embassy and an area that at one time had been heavily populated by the overthrown Democrat Party leaders who had been in power in the '50s.  Some of them were still around, so I even had some contacts with them.  Any contacts with anybody way on the left I knew nothing about.  There were no communists unless some of these students declared themselves to be communists.</p>
<pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Where did we see these students having ties to the communisparty or were they sort of indigenous leftists?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I can't recall of any contacts the students had outside of Turkey.  They just were strong, young, anti-American, unhappy with the situation, unhappy with what they considered the military's limitations on full freedom on political activity.  A lot of it focused on us.  We were under, wouldn't seem such tight security these days, but at that time the embassy was much more carefully guarded.  I remember Bill Handley whose ambassador's residence was up on the hill where we finally put some marine guards at his door, saying, “Well, that won't do any good.  The only good that that will do is that they'll come in the house and shoot the marines and the shot will wake me up upstairs.”  But we did tighten things up a bit.  Nothing like what's being done these days I suppose.  I never felt any serious security problem.  I know our oldest child was walking the dog one morning and found a pipe bomb down the street from us, not actually in front of our house, but there was an American colonel who lived down the street, and my son pointed this out to him and he took over, but it wasn't the kind of thing that I was nervous about.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were the Kurds at all a factor during this time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, not really.  We of course had a consulate in Adana, where then consul Dan Newberry would travel a bit in the Kurdish areas, but they had not reached the point of opposition that they have in the last ten years, although you would hear reports about how they wanted to be able to have Kurdish language in schools, to have Kurdish newspapers or radio or whatever, but it wasn't nearly at the level that developed later when they had a more dynamic leadership and when they got support from Syria.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, you didn't have external relations with you know there's a point where the internal external coincide.  What about, with Syria, Iraq and Iran, I mean, was there much sort of people seeping in from these?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, of course Iran was a friend at that time.  The man who had formerly been Turkish ambassador here whom I knew from his job here was then the secretary general of CENTO headquarters which was in Ankara.  I was involved in some social things that he would give and became acquainted with some of the Iranians. I really didn't have that much to do with other embassies.  The other embassies would sometimes come to me to say what's going on and talk to me.  I gave them broad briefings.  I was pretty well known around town as someone who knew about Turkish politics.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you find the army?  I mean was the army always a presence?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
<p>GREENE:  The Turkish army or the American military?</p>
<p>Q:  Well, let's talk about first the Turkish army.  Was there the feeling that they were sort of keeping an eye on everybody and keeping book on the politicians and all that?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, yes and no.  You would not know about them just being there, but much was going on. I wrote a series of cables in 1970 which in effect predicted that something was going to happen and that the Turkish military were beginning to indicate deep concern that Demirel wasn't taking sufficient action against these students.  Certainly at that time we were increasingly aware of the military's political power.  I did not have any contacts in the upper level of the military.  The ambassador I'm sure knew some and maybe even the military attaches, although my impression was they didn't know much of anybody.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about the American military?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, the American military first of all provided us with some very good services.  They had a commissary, px, school, all those things.  You could groan about some of it, but it was still very convenient.  Our children had schools to go to.  I'm not speaking of the top leadership, but the average colonel, lieutenant colonel, major really didn't enjoy being there and did not want to become well acquainted with the Turks.  None of them spoke Turkish.  They stuck with themselves.  They used their commissary privileges constantly.  They were not very helpful.  There were so-called listening posts around Turkey, which were partially military, and partially NSA.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  These are up on the Black Sea?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  There were civilians and military at these places.  I had the impression that they had good contacts.  I took a trip along the Black Sea coast once, an official trip.  I stopped to talk to some mayors along the way and they seemed to know, I mean they didn't know the details, the classified details, but they knew the people, they obviously had had some contact with the commanding officer or commanding civilian or whichever at these listening posts.  I think these people out from Ankara had much better contacts with the Turks.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, I used to be part of that process.  I was in Japan and the people, many of these had gone to the language school, and so just by that very nature were much more open and interested in society; otherwise, they wouldn't have spent a year in Russian or something of that nature.</p>
<pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
<p>GREENE:  I think we had some good people.  I have since run into a few of them around town here and they're still interested in Turkey unlike the people in MAG headquarters who really didn't impress me.</p>
<p>Q:  Tell me, again, this is outside of your stripped purview, but you were in Turkey, what was the feeling towards Greece at the time you were getting it from Ankara?  The colonels were in power.</p>
<p>GREENE:  The relationship was as belligerent as you could be, short of war, but there had been a near war while I was in Izmir over Cyprus.  There was a Greek ambassador in Ankara and there were contacts, but the Greeks were blamed for just about anything.  Particularly the Republican Peoples Party which was not power for part of this time was very vociferous in taking the leadership on being anti-Greek and pro-Turk.  But, as I told you I was the internal political guy, we didn't talk about Greeks too much.</p>
<p>Q:  Were there many, were you feeling pressure from Washington on anything?  How about the, you know the Armenians in the United States?  Were they raising their usual problems?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, having been on the Turkish desk myself I was known to people back in Washington and the main thing I got was very positive comments about what I'd been doing.  I think the only sort of internal Turkish problem that came from any pressure from the State Department, and this seems very minor in retrospect, was having to do with fundamentalist Christians wanting to go out into eastern Turkey to Mount Ararat where Noah's Ark was supposedly located.  It happened also to be within a stone's throw, almost literally, of the Russian border, the Soviet border and the Turks didn't let people just casually go out in that area.  Depending on the degree of influence any one of these religious groups might have in Washington, we would put a little or perhaps a little more pressure on the Turks to let them go out there and look.  I know in two cases groups did go right next to the Soviet border.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, going back to the students were we concerned that the Turks might come down too heavily on the students?  Were we concerned about how heavy a hand the Turks might eventually use on them?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I would say in one word.  No, this was the height of the Cold War.  They did damage to us, not only burning the ambassador's car, but in some other minor attacks.  We were strongly supportive of the Turkish government, as we kept saying, one of our closest allies.  Any group that opposed that government, we were opposed to.</p>

<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did the ambassador's car get burned?  Was he in it?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
<p>GREENE: He went out very foolishly, a typical Komer move, to one of the universities to call on the president or director, the Middle East Technical University on the outskirts of Ankara which was a plus for America in that we had helped set it up, a lot of teaching was in English.  An American ambassador should be aware of it, but Komer went out and the driver parked the Cadillac in front of the building and it of course attracted attention.  While Komer was inside the building the students attacked and burned the Cadillac.  No, he was not in the car.  He should have had much more security.</p>
<p>Q:  What was sort of the prognosis about Turkey in those days, whither Turkey, I mean was it on the right road and did it seem to be moving along or did we see it as sort of lurching backwards and forwards?</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's a hard question.  I mean really, seriously it is.  On the political side we were not too concerned about the overthrow of Demirel.  We liked Erim.  We liked somebody trying to crack down the leftist students, which they didn't do a very good job of doing.  Economically we were pouring a lot of money in there.  We had a big aid mission and I don't think we felt we were getting our money's worth out of that.  We were very pro-Turk at that time.  I mean Turkey was extremely important to us not only as a member, a fellow member of NATO, but being right next to the Soviet Union, being right next to the Arab world and having the second largest ground forces in NATO.  So anybody such as leftist students who opposed the government, we opposed.  Politically we certainly were satisfied with the Turks, but economically they were really not moving ahead very fast.  They had these so-called state enterprises, state monopolies, which slowed the economic growth down to around zero, very bureaucratic, very clumsy organizations.  They didn't listen to a lot of what we suggested.  Maybe we suggested the wrong thing, but they didn't listen much even though we were giving them a lot of money.  An America who had been in Turkey four or five years who just loved the country and had been working with the Turks to set up a new civil service system.  After his tour was he was somewhere in Africa still came back to Turkey on his vacation; he just loved the place.  He came back once and went into see the civil service people with whom he had worked and he said, “How's my plan going that I wrote with you?”  They said, “Oh, come on I'll show you.”  They went down in the basement of this building and there in this waterlogged room was a stack of his printed plans sitting there on the floor, that was it, four or five years of work.  So, we gave them money, some of which came back to us through military purchases, but we also gave them economic aid and it was not very well implemented.  I think a lot of studies since then have shown that just pouring money in, if a country isn't going to reform itself, doesn't do much good.  That's probably the case of Turkey.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  While you were there were there any disasters, earthquakes thasort of thing, there always seem to be?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't remember, no.</p>
<pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
<p>Q:  Did the Turkish students, I'm not talking about the ones that are trying to burn down the place, but the normal Turkish students who come out, from what I gather, rather were very serious and quite dedicated to it.</p>
<p>GREENE:  The Turkish people are quite serious and dedicated and these leftist students were a small minority, very vocal and very active.  I think that I mentioned the last time I was here, the Turks are serious balanced people in general and they were proud of having a greatly growing number of universities, a growing number of university graduates, they loved to come to the United States to study.  They wanted to speak English if they could. I think the young ones realized the heavy weight that the economy was carrying because of the state enterprise system.  Since then some of those earlier students have helped to change that.  In other words, we were basically popular, but these leftist students, mostly in Ankara and Istanbul, definitely did not like us.</p>
<p>Q:  What about the role of Germany?  I mean there had been the World War I alliance.  The Germans helped out the Turks at that time.  Later so many workers from Turkey went to Germany.  What was the German Turkish connection as you saw it at that time?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Not nearly as what you just described.  That's all ancient history.  Turks had been involved with us since the Truman Doctrine.  It was America that they wanted to be connected with.  The German embassy was large, active, had some good people in it, and sometimes you would find older politicians rather than trying to speak English, knew German.  I think that when Dubcek came from Czechoslovakia the Germans were useful in some connections with him.  The British, do you want to talk about others?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I do.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The British had good contacts in Turkey.  They had some excellent people in their embassy.  A lot of them spoke Turkish. The embassy was not as large as ours and of course they didn't have the large military and economic missions that we did there, but what they knew a lot of people.  They were very balanced in their understanding of the situation and I got to know several of their people quite well.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there at that time, how many language officers did we have?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, not nearly enough.  When I arrived, as I said, Elaine Smith was still there.  She had been trained in Turkish and was one of the most experienced Turkish language officers in the Foreign Service.  So, there were the two of us.  Elaine left and was not replaced, so I was it.  Dave Cuthell who never actually had Turkish training, but had served for four years in Istanbul some years before and so he knew some pretty basic Turkish.  He couldn't carry on embassy business in Turkish, but he could chitchat.  I'm trying to remember the agency people certainly there were two who had had Turkish training, how many actual agency people there were there I'm not sure, but I know two of them had had Turkish training.  Basically it was a weak link and that's one reason why I was really it.  I was the guy who knew these people.  I was able to go out and talk to them, plus these three local employees, FSNs you call them now, who knew a lot of people and of course spoke Turkish.  It was not a good situation, but greatly improved I hope now.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there a natural either division or rivalry between Istanbuor Ankara and I'm talking about our consul general and the embassy.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, historically yes.  Of course long ago the embassy was in Istanbul and Istanbul in many ways for a long time considered itself far more important than Ankara.  Most of the leading journalists came out of Istanbul; except for the University of Ankara, which was relatively new, the major university centers were in Istanbul.  But, at the same time as Foreign Service personal cuts proceeded Istanbul lost internal political connections.  Duke Marian who had been Istanbul's internal political officer and left.  That was a great loss, and he was never really replaced in terms of somebody knowing what was going on.  Before my time,  Bob Minor had been consul general in Istanbul.  When he arrived and, as is the custom or requirement, went to Ankara to call on the ambassador, but never went back in his four years.  In those days, being consul general in Istanbul was considered a step toward ambassadorship.  Istanbul had this historic sense of independence and a true sense of being important for a long, long time.  They had the waterway to watch.  There was an assistant naval attach� assigned to Istanbul at that time and his job was to watch the ships going back and forth.  The consulate general had one of the two boats in the Foreign Service, an official State Department boat the Hiawatha, they still have it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Istanbul was what kind of power center as opposed to Ankara?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
<p>GREENE: It was a little bit like Washington and New York in that politics was in Ankara and economic and cultural affairs in Istanbul, but that was shifting.  Although I'm sure Ankara has never become the economic power that Istanbul was and still is, but in terms of journalism, for example, which is very important in Turkey, more and more there were good newspapers in Ankara, but the people you would hear about as commentators, the Walter Lippmans or the Joe Alsops or whatever of Turkey all wrote for newspapers in Istanbul.  A later ambassador after my time spent, didn't like Ankara and he got an apartment in Istanbul and used to spend a great deal of his time there, to the horror of the consul general at that time.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, you were talking about newspapers.  What was the role of the media?  I mean, for example, were the papers strictly party papers or where they you know?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, there were all kinds.  There were scandal sheets with girlie pictures in them.  There were at least two somewhat leftwing, first rate newspapers.  What Milliget and Cumhingat said was important, like the New York Times, and the people who wrote the columns or the editors were influential figures.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What about TV, was that very important during that period</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No.  It was just beginning.  It's hard to think of that now, but if there was TV it was not important.  I did not know anybody then who had a TV set.</p>
<p>Q:  Actually I was the consul general in Athens at the time started there in '70 and TV in Greece which was a little ahead of the thing, wasn't much.</p>
<p>GREENE:  It may have been some in Istanbul, but I have no recollection of TV being anything.  Radio was government radio, but newspapers were very important.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They were a newspaper reading public, then?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, indeed.  There were newspapers stands all around the corners of the big cities, you could buy anything.  I know in my two years in Izmir, the local paper, which was strictly an Izmir paper, was read all around that part of the Aegean coast.  It was a free somewhat right wing paper.</p>
<p>Q:  Did it work sort of the way that here in Washington and to some extent in New York, almost everybody who is in the power business, diplomatic or whatever, sits down in the morning and reads the Washington Post and the New York Times and that often sets their agendas.  Certainly it can do that in the State Department, too.  Did this occur at all in Turkey?</p>
<pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
<p>GREENE:  To an extent, particularly with the two papers I mentioned, although we also read what I referred to as scandal sheets just to see what their scandals were.  I would usually get myself a copy of both leading papers and look through them quickly.  We had these three Turkish employees and they came up quite quickly with an English summary of whatever major thing there was, including any editorial.  We had a morning political section meeting every day to which the senior local employee came for a while, before which he was excused, and he would summarize today's editorial.  Yes, we paid a lot of attention to newspapers.</p>
<p>Q:  This is the early years.  How about the Nixon Kissinger team, did you get any feel for their interest or lack of interest in Turkey or was this on their agenda at all?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I wasn't aware of it.  If you asked me about Iran I would have something to say, but on Turkey.  It's just the same thing I've already said, about NATO and the location of Turkey and the size of the Turkish armed forces.  In terms of something special, I don't know.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, then you left Ankara in '71?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '71.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Why didn't you extend?  I would have thought that such a good job.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was a terrific job, I was saying earlier this was one of the two best jobs I ever had in the Foreign Service.  Well, three years in one job and you move on.  I had mentioned earlier the negotiations about the opium poppy which Bill Handley, the ambassador there at the time, led.  He was really a nice guy, but he loved to pat himself on the back.  I had come back to Washington and was briefing the President and the NFC and so forth and somebody said, “Well, how much money would it take to persuade the Turks to back out or to do something about these poppies.”  From the top of his head, Handley said, “Thirty-five million,” which in those days was a lot of money.  That became the figure, and eventually we gave him thirty-five million to put some tighter controls on the poppy fields.  Anyway, because of all this that was going on, my family left immediately after school was over and I stayed on beyond what was the end of my tour.  I was the working level person on this whole subject, so I didn't leave until the fall.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The fall of '71?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
<p>GREENE:  '71.  Yes.  We're getting a little past Turkey, but this is perhaps the low point of my assignment process.  In '71 we were just beginning, believe it or not, to have more and more telephone conversations back and forth from Washington to whatever post you were in, including for personnel matters.  I'd done this great job, everybody was saying how terrific I was.  I can't even remember what I had bid for, but I knew I wanted to go back to Washington.  This guy Howie Schaeffer, was a personnel officer and he sent a message saying that I was going to be on the State-Defense exchange program over at the Pentagon.  Then he called me and I said, “I really don't like that.  I don't like the military.  I wouldn't be any good there.”  He said, “You better take that if you want any job at all.”  So, I shut up and came back and was for about a year in the Pentagon.  I don't know if this program still exists - they send us several colonels and we send them some FSOs.  I was assigned to the Air Staff in a job that had some connection to what I supposedly knew about.  It was mainly controlling a fund of money that the Air Force used to have studies done by private organizations such as Rand or universities that seemed relevant to air force interest.  Several hundred thousand dollars, but the funds were being quickly cut and there was less and less for me to do.  There were nice guys there, I met some pleasant people, but it wasn't much of a job.  I never had known Tom Pickering before, he was the deputy director of PM at the time, sort of my supervisor back in the State Department and I told him that this was not a job, there wasn't anything there, I wanted out after I'd been there about nine or ten months.  He got me out.  I really appreciated that and I was assigned to something totally different for the next year and a half in IO, nothing to do with the Middle East whatsoever.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, what was your job in IO?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was not one of my greatest jobs, but it was interesting.  I was on the economic and social side of IO and there are, were, I guess still are, regional economic social commissions.  One for East Asia, Latin America, Africa and so forth and I was the regional person within the economic social part of IO.  We were members of all these things, even though we were obviously not in the Far East, nor in Latin America, nor in Africa, but since we were the main money giver we made ourselves members of all these things.  I went to a lot of meetings, had some fascinating trips, but the main U.S. interests in these organizations, was where there was substance that might come up that really touched on our interests, particularly the Cold War and even more importantly how they spent our money because we were giving lots of money to I think in those days was it 25% or 30% of the UN budget?  Quite a bit of which went into the staffs of these regional commission and they were a disgrace.  They had all these high paid people.  Almost everybody was the equivalent of a career minister or whatever you want to say.  There weren't any low-level people; everybody was making lots of money.  It was a disgrace.  IO's main interests was what are they doing with our money.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I assume they all had Mercedes with chauffeurs?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, yes, it was terrible.  As I say, it was an interesting job and I would have had it longer if one evening at home Bob Dillon, had not called me and said, “Would you like to go back to Ankara?”  I said, “Well, I haven't been out of there very long, what are you talking about?”  He said, “Well”  I can't remember who the political counselor was, whoever it was had to leave and they needed a political counselor right away and there I was with all my experience and Turkish language and so forth.  Bob said, “I'd like to tell the ambassador about you.”  This was Bill McComber and I said, “Well, I'll talk to my wife.”  He said, “Okay.”  McComber didn't know me from anybody I guess because I'd not been on the Turkish desk at that time, but he told Bob Dillon that if it's okay with you, fine.  So, I went on fairly short notice by myself at first, but stayed only about eight months, leaving for personal reasons.  The political section setup was as when I'd been there as the internal political person.  This time I had a lot more to do with the external part, but a lot of my old contacts were still around, so I still saw some of them.  I was very disappointed not to stay longer.</p>
<p>Q:  I want to ask a question about the UN before we come to IO.  When you were looking at these lavish establishments with at least 25% of it our money and all that, I mean I assume that was part of your reporting, you were reporting back, what was sort of the reaction?  I mean, that's just the way they do it?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No.  The reaction was mild, considering how it.  Not really what goes on these days, I imagine, with congressional pressure.  We're cracking down on the use of our money.  But, yes, I would go to these meetings and report on what the secretary general of each of these commissions was doing and his staff to get the figures on the budget and how much each person is making and told my boss, John McDonald what was going on.  He said, “Yes, yes, I know that.  I've been to some of these meetings.”  But, I don't think anybody cared much.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  We weren't sort of making book on this to use later on?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I have a son in the Foreign Service who is a deputy director of the office of UN peacekeeping and they have two guys in this office who do nothing but follow the finances of American money in UN peacekeeping operations, much more involved now than we were then.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Going back to Turkey, you were there, well, we're talking abouwhat '73 or '74 or something?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '74 and '75.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How was Ambassador McCumber to work for?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, you want to know?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Ambassador McCumber was an SOB.  Is he still alive?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, up in Martha's Vineyard somewhere.  GREENE:  That's right, somebody told me he had some serious disease.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, I think Parkinson's or something.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  I didn't like him much.  I don't think he liked me much.  At least that seemed to be the case.  He respected my knowledge of Turkey.  He was a showoff.  He would go out and jog everyday at lunch and come roaring around, not change his clothes again, but stay in his shorts and sweated shirt and walk around the embassy telling everybody what to do.  He was a showoff.  He had these marvelous connections back in Washington.  He was a friend of former Secretary Dulles, his wife had been Dulles' secretary.  She was a charming woman, by the way.  He wasn't as bad as Bob Komer, but he was headed that way.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Had things changed at all in Turkey when you got there?  Coulyou see a different balance?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  Definitely.  The overthrow of the Demirel government in '70 and then Nihat Erim for a while.  There had been a serious crackdown on leftist students in the meantime.  As I said, pretty soon Erim just retired and moved out to his farm where he was eventually murdered.  But there was very definite change.  I think Cumhurriyit, which at that time was the closest thing to be a leftist newspaper, was more moderate.  This was a sign of the times.</p>
<p>Q:  Did you feel that the sign of the times, was this reflecting just the government or did you feel that the population as a whole had had it with the students?</p>
<p>GREENE:  I don't think the population as a whole ever really supported them, but nobody had guts enough to do much about the students and so once again, as this happened several times in Turkish history, the military forced the situation.  The Turks are happy with the military.  I keep reading even today I'm sure you do, too of people saying, “Well, Turkey is never going to become fully democratic unless they do something about this military involvement in day-to-day politics.”  Well, they are not involved in daily politics, but they are certainly the ultimate power and the Turks don't object.  The Turks, at least this was the case when I was there, mostly say fine.</p>
<pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there a problem in the embassy with McCumber, I mean?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  People laughed about him.  He was gung ho.  He had been a marine at one time and he liked to think he still was a marine I think.  He was a very intelligent man, no doubt about that. Whether Komer was intelligent I don't really know, but McComber was.  He had vast experience and wide connections in Washington.  He had been assistant secretary for congressional affairs among other things.  He could pull strings easily from Ankara and in that way he was a really good ambassador.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm told that he had quite a temper.  Did you ever see it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  He did.  He did.  Quite a change from people like Bill Handley.  I never felt the real anger, but he let me know if he wasn't satisfied.  He also would let you know the opposite. Once a contact of mine when I was there before had, in the meantime, become Minister of Education and I went around and called on him in his new capacity, got some information out of him and sent a cable about it.  The ambassador came in my room and said, “This is what I like to see you do.”  So, he liked action and getting out there and seeing these people.</p>
<p>Q:  How did you find, sitting there as political counselor, how did you feel the reporting was, did you feel you got a good picture considering your officers in Adana, Izmir and Istanbul, how did you feel, were you getting good reports?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, Adana never did much reporting.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That was keeping the air base happy or?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was basically to keep the air base happy, to handle, as you mentioned here last time, the vast social security fraud and to travel around a bit in Kurdish areas.  Izmir was slowly being cut in staff.  I can't remember how many people there were by that time, but it didn't do much good.  Istanbul still did.  Istanbul still had very good contacts with journalists and cultural leaders of various sorts.  I don't remember who it is who was doing the writing, but I remember I went to Istanbul for the consul general decided he would have a gathering of political officers from the whole country, there rather than in Ankara which is another example of Istanbul's importance, so I went there to represent the embassy.  They were good.  They knew a lot of what was going on.</p>
<p>Q:  In your position as political counselor, I'll go back to one of my original questions, did you find you were getting much input from the station?</p>
<pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
<p>GREENE:  More than when I was the internal political guy in the previous job.  The chief of station and his deputy and I saw each other from time to time.  I really still didn't know that much.  I think insofar as anybody below the ambassador knew, the DCM, but they were pretty close-mouthed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Any presidential visits or big visits?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, no.  We always were having CODELS.  That was sort of a routine thing.  Senators particularly seemed to like to come to Turkey.  I remember straining my Turkish once to try to describe some details of a haircut that a senator wanted in a barbershop.  I had to think of the right words for sideburns and all these things.  The senator said, “Tell him to do it this way.”  We had a lot of CODELS, lots.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  During this time was there concern about the “Soviet menace” or was the feeling that things were pretty static?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was still very much the same.  I think by then let's sein the mid-'70s who was the head of the Soviet Union then?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I guess Brezhnev.  He was getting older.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Brezhnev, yes.  The Soviet Union was stultified I think and therefore, although the agency people in the embassy certainly followed in detail everything that happened to the Russians, to the Soviets, it didn't seem as important.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did Turkey feel any obligation to mess around in Syria or iPalestine, Israel?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, all that's more recent.  Although there was a friendship at that time between Turkey and Israel, it was not what has happened in more recent years where they are practically allies, not quite, but close.  The Turks used Israel for certain kinds of technical training and I believe our MAG sent some Turkish officers to Israel for I don't know what, some kind of training.  They were friendly.  The senior Israeli in Ankara wasn't called an ambassador, but he in fact was an ambassador.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How about Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, how were things while yowere there?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
<p>GREENE:  Well, this was the ambassador's main concern, this was perhaps the hottest time in the Cyprus issue.  Bulent Ecevit was, Prime Minister and had recognized the Turkish slab of land across the north of Cyprus and had sent in quite a number of Turkish troops to assist there.  We were deeply concerned about this and so the ambassador was personally involved in a great deal of this himself.  I was often the notetaker when the ambassador or the foreign minister talked about Cyprus.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see any, well this is the Turks under provocation had taken over a sizeable hunk of Cyprus in July of '74?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, that's what I'm saying, it was '74 and '75.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What happened, were you there in July?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I arrived in late July, early August and I remember the new head of the consular section and I both arrived on a plane in Istanbul and were told that there were no planes flying to Ankara anymore.  The Turkish air space had been closed because of possible war and that if we wanted to get to Ankara we would have to figure out some other way so we took a bus, a very public bus and that was my first awareness of the tight restrictions being developed</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: How was this playing in, you know from the newspapers or youTurkish contacts?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The Turks are proud of their military background, their military strength, they were quite gung ho.  Ecevit of course, was aggressive in terms of recognizing Turkish-Cypriot independence.  He was very popular.  He doesn't seem like that kind of man today, relatively young, assertive, intelligent, spoke English which helped.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were we, I mean at your level were you going around and tellinthe Turks to cool it and all that or?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  No.  The ambassador's very proud of having this as his baby and, as I say, he mostly saw the foreign minister, two times I saw the foreign minister with him and the prime minister.  He probably saw some of the military, too, I don't know.</p>
<pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you at that time feeling the brunt of the Greek lobby actinon congress on arms embargo?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Having been Turkish desk officer before, I felt it much more here in Washington than there.  We were certainly aware of them, but in Ankara the importance of Turkey to us was most important.</p>
<p>Q:  I mean were you though getting any feedback from your Turkish contacts saying, “How could you put this embargo on us?”  If you were there, I can't remember when the embargo went on, but “how could you do this to us because we were responding to Greek aggression?  Which I think is quite true.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Quite true, yes.  I'm sure there were people who thoughthat.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But anyway, you didn't feel that you were in a hostilsituations?  I left Greece the first of July 1974, but?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It was about a month later than I arrived in Ankara.</p>
<p>Q:  But, obviously the Greeks were pounding the drums and talking about Turkish aggression which of course had nothing, they made no reference to the fact that the Turks came in in response to a coup on the part of the Greeks there to take over the whole island and they got caught with their hand in the cookie jar and it got chopped off.</p>
<p>GREENE: That's right.  I honestly don't remember that much about that subject, since the ambassador was really doing the whole Cyprus thing himself.  I remember he would go see somebody, often the prime minister, and then in the middle of the night he would say he wanted to write a cable about this.  This caused a flap at the embassy in that he would have his secretary available, and he would want to have me present at the same time, so we'd go to the residence at midnight, somewhat groggy to say the least, but this was the way he operated.  He was a late night man.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, how about, you were mentioning that you left after onleight months?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: Yes.  Again I was suddenly in Washington without aassignment.  Were you ever on the board of examinees, along that tine?</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes, yes, I was doing the board of examiners, '76 to '77, I mea'75 to '76.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: Okay, I was put on the board of examiners very briefly.  Then I was made an inspector for FSOs assigned around the United States, to various city and university assignments.  It was interesting.  I went to Austin and West Point and Denver and all kinds of strange places.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  To write efficiency reports?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What was your impression of the farming out program?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  These were not our best FSOs at all.  They were people who, like most FSOs, are bright, intelligent, but not the most outstanding.  A lot of them, wherever they were, were looking for a connection to move into after retirement.  Two or three of them had PhD's and could see themselves as professors at whatever university they happened to be at at the time.  So finally, Stan Sschiff, you know Stan Schiff?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Stan had been asked to set up the U.S. involvment in a big UN conference known as Habitat which was going to take place in Vancouver and he wanted two or three people to help him, so I became his deputy.  I was on the delegation to Habitat and developed all information from HUD and HUD Secretary Hill.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  HUD is Housing and Urban.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, Hill was to be the head of our delegation, so we did a lot of work with her.  I went to Vancouver, a member of the delegation. I finally got back to where I should have been, mainly in Iranian affairs in '77.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, maybe this would be a good place to stop, Myles, I know you have to leave in a few minutes and before we get into it it's probably better to stop at this point and we'll pick this up in 1977 when you're going to be in doing Iranian affairs.  You did it from '77 to when?</p>
<pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
<p>GREENE:  Okay.  I didn't do it very long because, not knowing that we were about to have a revolution, I went in '78 to Tehran again as political military counselor.  I was there through the revolution; we can talk about that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, absolutely.  Okay.  Great.</hi>
</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This is March 25, 2002.  Myles, you were on the Iranian desk frowhen?</p>
<p>GREENE:  '76 to '78.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  '76 to '78.  What was the situation when you were, in the first place, describe where the Iran desk fit into the...</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The Iran desk was in NEA on the fifth floor, more or less directly below the assistant secretary's suite.  I was called the deputy director.  It was a terrific office.  Charlie Naas was a fine guy, the director.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That's N-A-A-S?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's correct.  Dutch.  I know when the Carter administration came in and the new secretary arrived, Phil Habib who was the under secretary for political affairs, was taking the new secretary around to show him the place and came to the Iranian desk as an example of a really well run desk.  He wanted the boss to see what a really good desk was.  So it was.  Charlie was a good boss, relaxed, efficient and we did a good job within policy limits.  Those limits had been established some years before in the Nixon-Kissinger regime, namely that Iran was a highly valued ally and we should do all we could to keep them that way.  Nixon had established certain countries around the world to which we would give some responsibility for regional stability and Iran was it for that area.  It also meant that anything the Shah wanted to buy in the way of military equipment we would say, “Please go right ahead,” even though there were some laws that required more of an examination.  Kissinger had said carte blanche.  Charlie and I used to joke when we'd get these letters from anti-Iran people and our replies would practically have the same opening sentence, something about through six administrations this has been a great friend of ours and blah, blah, blah.  That was our usual reply.  Charlie was away a lot and so I was often acting director.  I was also the political military person there which meant that part of my work was working with this guy Robinson, the head of the military sales office in PM.  I called him Robbie.</p>
<pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
<p>Q:  Who was that?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Everybody called him Robbie.  He was civil service.  Anyway, in that connection my one unhappiness occurred.  This is an interesting example of the relationship between a desk within the bureau and the regional affairs office within that bureau.  The political military person in the regional office for NEA happened to be Henry Precht, who had just finished four years as the political military person in Tehran and was still very, very interested and knowledgeable about it.  One of the few requests by the Shah to purchase equipment that raised any eyebrows was for four or five AWACS, which was a big purchase.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is a very large plane equipped with fancy radar.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right. And so, much more than usual that request resulted in people looking seriously about whether the Shah should have this fancy equipment at which point Henry Precht stepped in.  He didn't have any business in Iran affairs, except whatever a regional officer is supposed to do, he grabbed the ball and I was very uncomfortable.  I told Charlie I was very uncomfortable at this.  Henry's a good friend, still is, one of my best friends, but in the end I would say the decision to sell, that is at our level, the working level in the State Department, the decision to go ahead with the sale was as much Henry's words as it was the desk's word.  Henry was known for stepping into business.</p>
<p>Q:  Why, this is a very complicated system which needs an awful lot of maintenance and really when you're talking about maintenance, you're really talking about American maintenance.</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, AWACS.</p>
<p>Q:  AWACS, yes.  I mean getting somebody into this, getting Iran into this, I mean would probably have been of marginal value.</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  Well, as I say, we were still coasting under the guidelines established by Henry Kissinger that we not raise serious questions, that Iran was our partner in that region and that included defending or not defending or being aware of any trouble up and down the Persian Gulf, Iraq.  The Shah seemed to think that AWACS would help him do that job.  Most Iranian purchases breezed right through, but these AWACS raised questions.</p>
<p>Q:  When you arrived there, was the fact that, I'll say the fact, but you can dispute me on this, that there were had been for some time instructions not to be overly critical about reporting on internal matters within Iran, was this a problem?</p>
<pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
<p>GREENE:  Not at that time, no.  Of course, our signals were still what I had said; the Shah was the man.  I remember Ambassador Helms, who was just in his latter months as I arrived on this job, wrote what he called his farewell letter to the secretary.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it would have been Kissinger.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Kissinger, yes.  A farewell letter about four single-spaced typed letter, which in effect said things are just dandy here.  I see this partnership continuing for far off into the future.  The Shah is a reliable intelligent partner and we're lucky to have him.  That was the gist of it.  But, I got a carbon copy, that old fashioned term, and now on the bottom the drafting officer was Jack Miklos as the DCM and who had previously been the director of Iranian affairs and was very good at this job of selling Iran.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It was Jack Miklos?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  M-I-K-L-O-S.  He lives in San Francisco now.  A long time FSO, later deputy assistant secretary.  So, that was the gist of that job. We had a good office.  A number three person office, this was the only time in my Foreign Service that unusual that I encountered somebody who was on drugs.  I don't even remember this guy's name.  He was supposedly the economic and AID person working in our office and he would just disappear for hours on end.  Charlie had all kinds of problems trying to ease him out of the job.  Then the new ambassador who succeeded Helms was Bill Sullivan and he of course came through the desk for briefings we became acquainted. Charlie had his eye on being Sullivan's DCM, which he became and then he said, “Would I like to come.”  So, Charlie went to Tehran as Sullivan's DCM, in the spring, this was '78.  I followed soon as the political military counselor.  The next six or eight months were very strange, to say the least.  First of all my wife was finishing a degree at George Mason, so our 14 year old son and I went out awaiting my wife's arrival.  I had knew to what degree Sullivan or anybody in the U.S. government knew that the Shah was ill, that he had had cancer and that that might be the reason he was trying to push off responsibility and prepare his son to be the new Shah.  It has since been said that the British ambassador knew.  My man work was with the MAAG.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Military assistance group?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  The head of which happened to be Phil Gast who had been a colonel back in the Air Force in my late lamented brief assignment on the State-Defense exchange program.  So I knew him.  He was a two star general by then and was very helpful to me.  I was just beginning to get to know some of these military people when stirrings began on the street. This was October.</p>
<pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  '78?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '78.  Yes.  But it still didn't seem that serious.  It was at this time that the embassy suddenly became aware of the fact that it really didn't have any useful contacts with the religious mullahs and ayatollahs in Iran.  There were maybe one or two contacts that John Stimple had, but that was about it. There had been an FSO, an excellent language officer, who was not there at the time.  He was back here on some job in Washington.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Who was that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE: Stan Escudero.  He later became ambassador to one of the new countries, Turkmenistan I think, one of those places.  Anyway, Sullivan said we need somebody who has some contact with these religious people.  Escudero came out on temporary assignment and reestablished some of his contacts.  It soon became clear that Khomeini, a name just coming to the fore from Iraq and then Paris, was the man who was going to take advantage of all this increasing unrest.  It was Sullivan's position, and therefore the embassy's position, that there's this man who has considerable influence here, we should make some contacts with him.  This was the crux of the disagreement between the embassy and Washington and Zahedi, who was the Iranian ambassador here in town.  He was not even doing business with the State Department, but with business with Brzezinski in the White House.  They were the ones who were trying to keep the Shah on, while Sullivan was saying we have this man in Paris, let's contact him, let's talk to him and see what's going on.  We really didn't.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I think Warren Zimmerman was in Paris and had some contact witpeople around.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, well, that may be.  But the fact is there was a serioudisagreement between the embassy and Washington.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, going back to the time you were the desk officer, did you have, what was your estimation of the role of the Iranian embassy and its importance?</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, it was very important.  The ambassador was very important, the embassy didn't amount to very much, but the ambassador was Zahedi, a former son-in-law of the Shah, a hard charger.  In an Iranian sense, a charming man, not exactly my cup of tea, but he was very socially active, spent lots and lots of money on parties and lunches.  Occasionally he would come to the State Department and I would often be the one to meet him at the front door and take him where he was going, but he really didn't pay much attention to us to tell you the truth.  His business was with Breshinsky and, whenever possible, the president himself.</p>
<pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This would be Carter?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  This was Carter, who had come into office questioning Kissinger's idea of this close relationship, but it was just a few months before he began to swing over to more or less the same pattern that we had been following.  In fact, in '78, no, no, '77 Carter invited the Shah for a state visit to Washington.  This was the way things had been for ten years.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  While you were on the desk was there disquiet about the AmericaIranian relationship and its future at all?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  There were always people who said what are we having such a close relationship with this dictator, that sort of thing, but in official circles I don't know of any.  There were Iranian students where in town who did not like the Shah.  I know when the Shah came for his state visit and we had the usual ceremony from the grounds to the White House there was tear gas fired from outside the fence by some student demonstrators.  These were people with connections to what was beginning to develop in Iran.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Back now to...</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
<p>GREENE:  Back to Iran.  Back to Tehran. I was just beginning to get into my duties and they seemed interesting.  I had had quite a bit of experience with military affairs, and then everything began to slow down and increasingly the embassy was focused on these demonstrations in the street.  It's an ancient custom in Islam that when someone is killed, 40 days after that event there would be some sort of commemoration.  So, when someone was killed in October, there was a march in the streets, 40 days later some more people were killed and 40 days after that there was an even bigger demonstration.  Increasingly what we would call warrant officers in the military, people in between noncoms and officers, who did a lot of technical work and had been trained by us to run the machinery that we sold the Iranians, began to join some of this.  Their lower middle class status was frustrating.  About November in the very large American community in Iran, particularly in Tehran, word began to spread and some private citizen said that maybe we should go somewhere else for a while.  I'll never forget one of the more prominent businessmen I saw shortly before he left, he said, “Gee what a shame, so many business opportunities here.”  We began to cut back a bit on the size of the embassy, not very much into early December.  By early December we were sending a lot of dependents home.  My wife had not even arrived.  I had this 14-year-old son with me and he left with a bunch of high school students on a plane and went home.  I had been planning not only for my wife to come by Christmas when she finished her degree here at George Mason, but also our daughter, who was in college, to spend Christmas holidays with us.  My wife and everybody else decided she better not come.  My daughter said she was coming, so she came and was practically the only dependent in the embassy.  They roped her into working two weeks in the consular section because they needed help.  She thought it was quite an adventure.  During all this time my job was, I was about to say the bottom fell out, but that's not quite true, but there was less and less to do with the political military affairs.  More and more the embassy was concentrating on what was going on in the streets.  I don't know the details of Sullivan's argument with Washington, but General Hiser who was a four star general in Frankfurt, commander of European forces out of Germany, was sent to join Sullivan and move into the ambassador's residence with him and the two of them together would handle personally much of what was going on.  I remember once I was with the ambassador for something or other and I said, “You know, I really don't know what's going on.  If you want to use me in anyway, you should bring me in.”  I thought it was very forward of me, but he said, “Yes, that's right.”  So, that evening he invited me over to the residence with General Hiser and I heard their evening conversation, telephone conversation with Washington and became a little more aware of what they were doing.  I was never really used a lot.  Charlie was involved almost 101% with problems of the American community, evacuations of various sorts.  The political officer who had been brought in who knew religious people was very busy contacting them.  The regular political section was also busy, as was one guy in the economic section following the collapse or near collapse of several Iranian banks.  In general the embassy was totally focused on what was going on.  By early January, more and more people left, including my daughter.  There was shooting going on.  There were large fires of old tires that really stink and sometimes those of us who lived in the area north of town, where most Americans lived, couldn't even get downtown to the embassy.  Then in late January the Shah left, Khomeini arrived shortly thereafter.  We had contacts with Bazargan who was the prime minister, we knew him.  Amazingly enough the foreign minister was an American citizen, a dentist from Texas who had decided he wanted to be on that side.  So, all these people just in a matter of a few days were moving in.  Having not been to the embassy for several days, those of us who lived in the northern suburbs decided that we would go into the embassy in order to catch up on what was going on.  The embassy car came up for us and we were working when all of a sudden this crowd of people came over the wall of the embassy, and this was sort of a dry run for what happened later.  The so-called students had guns and they started running around the compound, shot up the reception area of the ambassador's residence, went into the embassy restaurant, killed two Iranians there.  I was with the ambassador when a marine out on the compound called on the walkie-talkie and said, “Sir we are surrounded.  Should we shoot or what?” He said, “Put your guns down.”  I always remember the reply from the marine, he said, “Ay, ay, sir” and he did.  But there was a lot of tear gas around.  Those of us who were in the building went into the code room.  All these years, I had never been into a code room.  It was interesting.  The code clerks had this heavy sledgehammers with which they were breaking up all their equipment.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars I'm sure.  The political counselor was on the phone trying to contact the foreign minister to come to do something.  Finally the students broke into the steel door and we were herded into the ambassador's secretary's office and all were told to lie down flat on the floor face down.  A number of women started crying.  It was pretty sad.  By then the building was filled with tear gas.  So, we were all eventually taken out.  While we were standing around huddled in the parking lot along came the foreign minister and some Ayatollahs or some such people and told the students to leave us alone.  They all left, amazingly enough.  The embassy grounds were pock marked with shots and empty tear gas canisters and quite a bit of damage.  I'll never forget, about dusk, this all took about eight hours, this was February 14th, the same day that Spike Dubs was murdered in Kabul.  About dusk the British ambassador came walking in, walked across the grounds and said, “Where is your ambassador?”  We told him where he was and apparently offered the facilities of their communications system to us, which we used for some time, some days.  I had ordered some printed invitations, you know the usual Foreign Service things, and the guy who was my contact with the printers said, “Well, what about this?  We placed this order; you got to pay for it.” I said, “I don't know if I really need them right now.”  But, I paid something and we eventually got an embassy car that took us home.  Charlie called me that night and we had a little conversation, of course I didn't make the decision, but somebody decided that we better get almost everybody out and so we did.  With the exception of the ambassador and DCM and their secretaries and code clerks and three political officers and a few other people like that, security officer and marines. Everybody was told to go.  Pan American, which still existed then, was going to come and get us, plus some civilians who were still around. The story was, and I think it's true, that Pan Am stewardesses refused to come in. They said they didn't want to fly into Tehran.  So, the planes came in without anybody except the pilot and the co-pilot and somebody else.  All of us who were leaving moved down to the embassy compound for the last day and night and took off with a brown bag sandwich or two for the next day.  That was the end of my Tehran experience.</p>
<pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
<p>Q:  Were you getting on the political military side and we had all sorts of military attaches and all, were they angled to take a pretty good temperature of where the military was going?  Was it seen that the military was no longer much of an instrument?</p>
<p>GREENE:  At the senior levels yes, I think it was increasingly so.  About this time the then Deputy Secretary of Defense, this was probably in December, came on a long scheduled visit to Iran.  Why in the world he would want to come then was beyond me, but he called on all these senior people, senior generals and admirals and he sensed that there was a great division between them and everybody else below them.  I think a lot of these most senior people in the military were again beginning to think about their own skins.</p>
<p>Q:  Well, then, I mean you being the political military officer, were we concerned with all this hardware that the Shah had accumulated or was most of it sort of on its way?</p>
<p>GREENE: The decision on what to do about that was taken to Washington namely that we would stop the flow immediately.  Probably there was some on the way, but much of the big orders, including the infamous AWACS, had not arrived.  This has been one of the points of dispute even up to today, trying to settle the claims back and forth of who owes what to whom.  There are still court cases going on.  Getting out this enormous American community was very well done.  Sullivan left in May and Charlie was in charge into the summer, but really didn't want to stay himself.  His wife wasn't well; there were troubles of various sorts.  So, he was eventually replaced and we had no ambassador at this time when we still had pretty good contacts with the new government.  It was Washington's thinking, and Henry Precht pushed this very hard, that it was time to start restaffing the embassy some.  This was August of '79.  So, some of the people who were eventually caught in November as the hostages for those famous 444 days had recently arrived.  Some had only been there two or three weeks as we had just began to restaff the embassy.  I was fortunately not there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When you left, did you see this as a situation that could bremedied or did you see that?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  What situation?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In Iran was, I mean from our point of view?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
<p>GREENE:  Not really.  I saw that we had that following this ten or twelve years of supposed reliance on Iran had clearly been a mistake.  When I got back to Washington I of course had no assignment and people didn't quite know what to do with all of us who arrived.  I spent several weeks writing a paper on the whole military sales program to Iran and how it had actually been handled:  Namely stamped, approved and done, as opposed to the following law.  It was pretty widely circulated.  I think it was appreciated.</p>
<p>Q:  Was there any concern that our policy of avoiding doing what we were supposed to under the law meant that those of you who are involved are doing something illegal?</p>
<p>GREENE:  No, I don't believe so, I was never aware of it.  The various correct pieces of paper were signed and this guy Robinson knew what was going on, but in theory it was his office which was supposed to turn the necessary bureaucratic wheels for any sort of foreign military purchase.  In the case of Iran it was just done.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, you came back in '79?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  March of '79.  As I said, nobody knew what to do with us.  We were quite a number of FSOs arriving without assignment and I spent a little time helping Henry Precht on the desk.  I wrote that paper and I took a little vacation and then someone I knew in INR said, “Well, there's this guy who is leaving, the head of this South Asian section of the NEA division of INR.”  I said, “Well, that includes Iran.  I certainly know about Iran, but I don't know much about India and Pakistan, Bangladesh or whatever.”  I said, “Sure, I'll consider the job.  I really want a job, but I don't know if that's what I want.”  I was interviewed for the job and it was offered and it turned out to be, along with my political officer job in Ankara, one of the two best jobs I ever had in the Foreign Service.  The director of the NEA part of INR [Intelligence and Research] was George Harris, who was a former CIA person who'd come into the State Department on sort of a lateral transfer, a very bright guy, who did not like running an office, did not like the daily grind.  He liked very much to go out and brief people.  He'd travel a lot and would brief Egyptian officials, and Israeli officials and things like that.  So, very quickly I was running the NEA office, even though there was officially no deputy director's job there.  Before long George and Phil Stoddard who was the next up the line arranged for there to be a deputy director's position in this office and I became it.  It was sort of a Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside thing in that I really ran the office for three years.  It was great fun.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q: This was '79 to when?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  '79 to almost '82.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  '82.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  I have a strong background in Iran.  Turkey by that time was in EUR, so we were not bothered with Turkey particularly.  We had about 20 or 25 people in the staff and put out a daily highly classified briefing for the secretary and for the White House and we of course, maintained contact with other intelligence agencies all around town, got involved with a lot of the CIA studies on that part of the world.  George could have run it, but he didn't really want to and I thank him forever for letting me do it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, I mean, you got a couple of things that were going in that area.  One was the whole hostage crisis and all that and then you had what happened in Islamabad and all and then you had Afghanistan.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  The hostage business. Our daily brief piece of paper that we put together from INR for the secretary, famous or infamous for saying, “You guys really don't know what you're doing to try to get these hostages out.”  We kept explaining to the secretary the complications of the situation there and that the high level things that they were trying really weren't going to work.  A lot of people toward the end would say, “You know, INR really should shut up.”  But, we were right all the time, we were absolutely right.  I had a lot to do with that.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, what was the issue more or less?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The issue was whether the means being used by the White House to try to break loose the 50 or so hostages were going to get anywhere.  I personally did not have any plan of action; all I knew was what they were doing wasn't getting them anywhere.  I was going to say something about Afghanistan, but let me go back to Iran a minute.  The Iran desk officer for INR had a Ph.D. in Iranian studies.  I had a lot of knowledge and we thought we knew what we were talking about.  Phil Stoddard up the line seemed to agree with us and I know that when Carter approved the idea of trying to rescue the hostages, send in this group of troops with helicopters, I knew from my job in Iran that my files sitting there, probably shredded by then, contained at least one whole file on the problems of this particular kind of helicopter in sandstorms.  That sand got into helicopters very easily.  There's lots of sand in Iran and that was a risk and that was precisely what happened, if you remember.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh, yes.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Why in the world people didn't, I did not know.  Phil Gast, who I had followed to two assignments was by then a three star general and he was, I think, the director back here in Washington the rescue attempt.  We used to see CIA a lot and we generally agreed.</p>
<pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Started in December of '79.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes.  At first nobody knew, at least nobody I knew knew exactly the scale of what was going on and what they had in mind and I personally organized several meetings of CIA, DIA, ourselves and a couple of other people to try to figure out how many Soviets were there, what were they doing.  I remember we came up with this figure initially of 5,000 and of course it became much bigger later on.  We circulated in intelligence circles the figure of 5,000 and everybody was quite amazed that the number was so high.  We had a very good Afghan desk officer, Liza Van Hollan whose husband was an FSO, Chris Van Hollan, maybe you know her?  She really dug into this thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  She, what was her job?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  She was the Afghan desk officer for INR and she had had academic background, maybe even a master's degree on Central Asia.  So, I think we made a real contribution there.  Nobody was really sure what was going on in terms of the numbers and this was the kind of thing that you could pull facts together in an interagency way and be able to say, yes there are 5,000 and the figure is growing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was there any agreement in INR and with your CIA counterparts owhat the hell the Soviets were doing there in the first place?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, it seemed they were trying to protect the then prime minister or president, a communist whom they liked having him in power.  Like us in Vietnam, it just took more and more troops to do that.  Then of course I did not know the full scale.  I was aware of some things the CIA was doing as they began to finance the anti-Soviet forces.  I did not know it all I must say.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  How did you find the desk, I mean, the Afghan desk, were thepretty much involved?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, we had a great relationship.  I cannot say the same for higher ups in NEA, but at the desk level we did very well.  The Afghan desk officer, a woman who later became an assistant secretary, was a spokesman for the State Department for a while.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Phyllis Oakley.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
<p>GREENE:  Phyllis Oakley.  Phyllis Oakley and Liza Van Hollan had known each other for years.  These two women really did a great job.  We had good contacts with Henry Precht in NEA.  I knew Henry very well.  Charlie Naas got in one of these unfortunate Foreign Service predicaments in which they didn't know what to do with him and had sent him for a year to Davidson College, after which he floated some personal policy plans.  So, he was in my office a lot simply because he had nothing to do.  There was a good old school relationship around.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I interviewed Henry and he said at a certain point he became sorof persona non grata with the National Security Council.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Oh, he was very proud of that, yes.  Yes, Henry was a ball of fire.  It was the same Sullivan versus Brzezinski about how long should we stick with the Shah.  After that was all over and Khomeni had arrived and the Shah was gone it was Henry more than anybody who pushed restaffing the embassy in the summer of '79.  Gary Sick who was the NSC Iran person, a navy captain who, and Henry had a hard time with each other.  I'm sure Henry must have told you some of this.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes.  Well, in Afghanistan were we seeing this as a place to carry on a war or were we seeing the Soviets thinking they might get bogged down or were we concerned that the Soviets would use this as a starting point for the drive for the sea as another great game?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Lots and lots of people talked about the great game, and think that was perhaps at the base of a lot of the thinking.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Speaking of Pakistan, this is your first time dealing with it, think, what was your impression of Pakistan at this time?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I was just learning.  My impression was that it was awfully primitive.  I went on a field trip to India and Pakistan and a couple of other places and Pakistan compared with India seemed so unsettled, so unsure.  I got to see a lot of people and very friendly people, but the officials I saw, were not capable, not really sharp the way the Indians are.  They say that under the British the rule was often through Hindus rather than the Muslims, so the Muslims didn't have the experience of running anything and that certainly showed up.  Karachi was a hell; I mean an incredible place.  How in the world anybody could make any sense of it was beyond me.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were you there when the mob attacked and burned down the embassy?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
<p>GREENE:  No.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I mean were you on the INR side or?  This was in '79, too shortlafter the hostages were taken in Iran?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I must have been involved.  I obviously don't remembethat much.</p>
<p>Q:  What about India?  How did we see India at that time?</p>
<p>GREENE:  India was not very important to us.  Somebody higher up had a map on the wall in the State Department in which you'd see India and Pakistan and above it this enormous red animal which is China looking down on them. The traditional rivalry between China and India was the dominant fact; we just tried to stay out of it the best we could.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I think they go and charge around.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  That's right.  I went to Bombay and had the impression that the consul general and the consulate general didn't really do much except work with American businessmen there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was our major concern at that, were we concerned about the risof fundamentalism in Pakistan?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  In Pakistan?  I don't remember much about that.  I remember more political questioning of leadership and political questioning of the regime and the few people who claimed to be democrats saying this is a dictatorship, but in terms of fundamentalism, I don't recall much.  This was from '79 to '82.  Obviously there must have been something going on, but I was not aware of it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Do you remember did they have a military government when you werin Pakistan or was it?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  It must have been Zia.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did we see Pakistan as being basically a pretty unstable country?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, but valuable to us.  Partly because of its connections to China, Pakistan was seeking friendship anywhere and among other places turned to Russia.  We had a big AID mission, we had three pretty big consulates and I'm sure we had a big economic program.</p>
<pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, you left there in what '82?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Yes, nobody told me I had to leave.  It was a great job.  George Harris never gave the least hint that I should leave.  I was promoted while I was there and must have thought three years were enough I started looking around to get a job and ran into the problem of too many senior officers.  I went around knocking on doors.  I knew at least a couple of jobs were coming open in NEA and I couldn't get either one.  I was pretty unhappy about this whole thing.  Then somebody said there's this intelligence coordinating organization, the full name of which I'm not sure.  It's on F Street between, near the corner of 17th.  It was the place where the director of the CIA would sit when he was the Director of Central Intelligence.  They did have a few FSOs there as well as various other agencies.  I could go there.  I went there for a while and did not enjoy the work.  About this time both of my wife's parents died and left her some money, not an enormous amount, but some money and I thought this would help if I could just quit and I did in '84, June of '84.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Tell me on this intelligence board, what was it that you didn'enjoy or like?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I think part of it was being away from the State Department.  It was unfamiliar circumstances.  They seemed to think that I was an expert, amazingly enough, on terrorism, which I kept saying I'm not.  That's not my background, but they had me running an interagency committee on trying to figure out better ways for domestic agencies like FBI, Customs and Immigration, on the one hand, and foreign policy intelligence agencies, on the other, to communicate.  I had this committee with FBI people, CIA people, DIA and so forth and we came up with some thoughts.  The people in charge of this board thought it was great.  We can show that we are useful to somebody, but I didn't think much of it.  It mostly had to do with a means of radio communication from one agency to another and cutting the FBI in on certain things that they had not been cut in on before which obviously they probably didn't need to be, but they were.  The idea was to produce studies, this is the sort of thing that turns most FSOs off, to put in priority terms, what the USG want from our people in various countries around the world, to say that this is a priority 1B and this is a priority 4F or whatever.  I kept saying, “Well, that's not the way we do it in the State Department.”  That's the way the military attaches do it.  So, this might have been of some use to the military attaches, in terms of the State Department, I doubt it.  My boss who was an FSO, an ambassador, agreed with me.  I said I could see how this organized approach to reporting might be useful for countries where we had no embassy, which was the case in Iran at that time, but not the operation of an embassy.  So, I was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So, anyway, you left in '84?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
<p>GREENE:  That's correct.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Have you gotten involved in these things or traveled around a bit?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Well, I've had a pretty pleasant time.  I could use a little more money, but other than that, as I told you before, we have a Foreign Service son and we have been to every place that he's been.  We have traveled.  My wife speaks French and is very interested in France.  We've been to France a number of times.  We've also tried to keep our noses above water in terms of maintaining the house and paying our bills and that sort of thing.  I was for quite a number of years very involved in organizations in DC related to hunger issues.  I was on the board of Bread for the City, which is one of the big organizations here and I've done a lot of work for it as well as some volunteer work for other places like So Others Might Eat, and McKenna's Wagon and other such things.  I also am an active member of the church in D.C.  It's a very liberal church.  I was head of various things there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which church is this?</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  The Foundry of the United Methodist Church.  It is where thClintons went, I also read more.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, fair enough.</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  Anyway, we have had a very busy time.  We have four childreand we see them.  We have three grandchildren; we'd like to have more.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I know, you can give the order out, but...</hi>
</p>
<p>GREENE:  One of the children lives here and the Foreign Service person happens to be here at the moment on an assignment.  We have one in New Jersey and one in Colorado.  So, we see them.  My wife is at this very moment as we speak is in Florida with this little citrus grove that she owns.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Great.  I want to thank you very much.</hi>
