                <p>AMBASSADOR HERBERT JOHN SPIRO</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 25, 1994</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 25, 1994. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Herbert John Spiro, this is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. This is
                        a fortuitous meeting since Ambassador Spiro happens to be in Washington.
                        He's normally down in Austin, Texas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Ambassador, let's talk about your early background because it looks quite
                    interesting. Could you explain when and where you were born.</p>
                <p>SPIRO: I was born in Hamburg, Germany where there have been Spiro's since the
                    late 17th century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a great name. Is it a great family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: It's not a great name. When I was first in the State Department and I
                    served on the Policy Planning Staff for 5 years, before I was nominated
                    Ambassador to Cameroon and to Equatorial Guinea by President Ford, I made my
                    first trip to Europe for the Policy Planning Staff in the Summer of 1970. One of
                    my stops was at NATO Headquarters and, among other things, I was given a very
                    dull briefing by half a dozen high-ranking military officers, about the
                    organization of NATO for planning purposes.</p>
                <p>A Lieutenant Commander, what they used to call the “talking dog,” the briefing
                    officer, flashed diagrams on the screen which always had a “NATO Top Secret”
                    caption. And he'd say, “This committee does such and such and it's headed by
                    Colonel Olaf, a Norwegian officer. Next screen, this committee is headed by
                    Colonel McDonald, he's a British officer and he does such and such.” This went
                    on and everybody was yawning including myself. Then he said, “This committee is
                    headed by Colonel Papadopoulos, he is a Greek officer, he is a wonderful human
                    being!” And he went on and on gushing about this Greek officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was very naive, and maybe I still am. Spiro Agnew was Vice President of the
                    United States at the time, and it dawned upon me that they thought I was a -
                    Hellenic-American, and - probably - a nepotistic appointment of Spiro Agnew's.
                    So I was put in this quandary: Should I correct them, because they really
                    shouldn't be doing that sort of thing, or should I get a free ride. I decided I
                    could not embarrass them and had to get a free ride on my mispresumed
                    Hellenicity. That happened several times, and it still happens from time to
                    time.</p>
                <p>The name Spiro is a corruption of the name of the town of Speyer on the Rhine,
                    where there was an early Roman Jewish community that came up with the Roman
                    colonizers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: I was born in 1924 and I left Hamburg a month after Kristallnacht. We left
                    on December 14, 1938.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I take it you're of Jewish origin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your family doing in Hamburg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: My father was in what you'd call a wholesale distribution firm, for the
                    kind of stuff in this country like Proctor and Gamble products, wholesale for
                    Northern Germany. I was an only child and I attended private and public schools
                    - some of the best schools I ever attended anywhere, or that I have been
                    connected with, including Harvard. And I attended a public school, the Wilhelm
                    Gymnasium, until the day after Crystal Night, that is until Nov. 10th, and I
                    experienced no discrimination whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what 193-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: 1938. No discrimination. I just returned a week ago from 2 weeks in
                    Hamburg so that a lot of these memories, I've been there many times in between,
                    a lot of these memories were refreshed. Hamburg was, if not an anti-Nazi town,
                    it was a non-Nazi town, it'd always been sort of 'red' communist and social
                    democratic. They used to joke that like a [food] hamburger, they were pink
                    inside and [Nazi] brown on the outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A port town.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SPIRO: International port town, right. My family and I just had an unusually good
                    experience, or less bad experience, than people in other cities and regions of
                    Germany. We came straight, after spending a couple of weeks with relatives who'd
                    gotten out a year earlier in New York, we went straight to Texas - San Antonio.
                    There the widow of an uncle of my grandmother, on my grandmother's initiative
                    who had not even told my parents about it, made it possible for us to immigrate
                    to the United States. We were legal immigrants, legal aliens.</p>
                <p>I went to one term of junior high school in San Antonio, 3 years of high school
                    and one year of junior college. Graduated at the top of my class of 588 from
                    Brackenridge High School. As one of my old classmates in Hamburg just told me,
                    it didn't surprise him at all that I was first in my class because, again
                    unusually, I had been first in my class at the Wilhelm Gymnasium. In my last
                    year there, when the teachers had to show considerable courage to designate a
                    Jewish boy - they could have fiddled the figures -, they declared me the number
                    one student.</p>
                <p>...Which in Germany is considered a big deal and I need not have done anything
                    else thereafter. Whenever I go back there, people pay no attention to the fact
                    that I was an Ambassador of the United States or other things. “Herbert Spiro
                    was Primus im Wilhelm Gymnasium.”</p>
                <p>So we went straight to San Antonio. I then volunteered for induction to the army
                    because I was an enemy alien, officially. As such, I could not be drafted, I had
                    to volunteer, and I did in 1944. Although I could have joined the Army
                    Specialized Training Program (ASTP), which, in my case, would have made a
                    dentist or a doctor out of me, I was given the option of going into military
                    intelligence training, and I did.</p>
                <p>I was trained as an interrogator of German prisoners of war and served in combat
                    with the 104th infantry division for a couple of months in the Fall of 1944. And
                    then I was pulled back to the Battle of the Bulge, which started on December 15,
                    1944, to join the 11th armored division with which I spent the rest of the war,
                    ending up in Austria and being awarded a Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster
                    and a Purple Heart.</p>
                <p>Then I spent a year after the end of the year in Austria. First in Steyr, which
                    is near Linz, and half a year as a civilian employee of the War Department in
                    Vienna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find interrogating German prisoners and the
                        whole thing. What were you getting out of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SPIRO: It was the most satisfying work, apart from being an Ambassador, that I've
                    ever done in my life, because you got immediate results. I was with an armored
                    division and we discovered very quickly, after we joined the 11th, that unless
                    we got a hold of the prisoners almost instantly after they were captured, the
                    information would be useless because the point of the column was moving so
                    quickly that it would be pass�. So I made a practice of moving right behind the
                    lead company, which is what we called a “married” company of tanks and armored
                    infantry.</p>
                <p>I would get the prisoners instantly and I would interrogate them by the roadside.
                    Which was useful for two reasons, it intimidated them with the tanks and the
                    half-tracks standing there. And it made for very good relations with the
                    division to which we were attached, and on which we dependent for supplies,
                    provisions, because they enjoyed watching our interrogation.</p>
                <p>With the Germans, we'd been trained so well at Camp Ritchie that we knew just how
                    to get at German soldiers, depending on their rank and their age. If they were
                    enlisted men, we'd simply scream at them. They would usually say, “Under the
                    terms of the Geneva Convention all I need to give you is my name, rank and
                    serial number.” And then I would ask, “Who told you that?” And they would say,
                    “Captain Schmidt.” I would scream - we'd been taught to do this, and I got rid
                    of all the innate need for screaming for the rest of my life during that 6
                    months' period - I would scream at them, “You are now a prisoner of the United
                    States Army and you will take your orders from me, is that clear!” And they
                    would click their heels and say, “Jawohl!”</p>
                <p>If they were older or officers of senior rank, we would put it sort of on a
                    professional basis, “What did you think of our maneuvers?” And they would say,
                    “You have such overwhelming superiority of equipment” - as the tanks were
                    rolling by and the supply trucks -, “it's hopeless anyway.”</p>
                <p>In extreme cases of resistance, we would use pretty harmless psychological
                    tricks. I remember one case, I'd seen the movie about the Dreyfus case, in which
                    Paul Muni played Zola, where Dreyfus, as he's drummed out of the Officers Corps,
                    has his epaulets ripped off. I once did that to a German major who wouldn't
                    talk—I've written up some of those stories—and his morale just visibly collapsed
                    and he answered all questions, and he didn't have much to say.</p>
                <p>The trouble with most of them was that they didn't know much, but by
                    interrogating lots of them and putting it all together, we could form a pretty
                    good picture. For example I knew at my level, and this is was with the 104th
                    infantry division, that something big was being prepared which turned out to
                    become the Battle of the Bulge, which the Germans called the December Offensive.
                    Because various prisoners told me of seeing large concentrations of troops in
                    Cologne and elsewhere, near where we were, we were in a town called Eschweiler,
                    which is already inside Germany near Aachen. But apparently the people back at
                    Corps and Army didn't put it all together, so it came as something of a
                    surprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But anyway, that was a great experience, apart from the danger and the cold and
                    the frostbitten feet that I got, we would be shelled by a German 88s during the
                    night. I would interrogate a prisoner who told me where the gun emplacement was
                    that had been shelling us, and I would pass that information back to our
                    artillery. They would knock it out. In the afternoon I would pass by the knocked
                    out German artillery emplacement and I knew that I had done this.</p>
                <p>...Whereas in my later career as a university teacher, 20 years later, you were
                    lucky if they come back, and they do come back. And they come back in very nice
                    ways but it takes 20 or 30 years later: “That seminar that I took from you
                    really changed my life, that's why I'm doing whatever I'm doing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because this is focused on foreign affairs, what was your
                        impression of Austria right after the war, both as a civilian and as a
                        military person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Well, I'd never been in Austria before, I was 18 when I joined the army. I
                    was 20 when we arrived in Austria as the first division to cross into Austria
                    from Bavaria. It was amusing. We were liberating Austria. We had been told,
                    you're liberating Austria. Austria was forcefully annexed to Germany. So we
                    crossed the Danube into Linz, which is a large city. Whereas in German towns
                    that we conquered, not liberated, they would hang out white flags, and we would
                    tell them to, as a sign of surrender. Usually those white flags were bed
                    sheets.</p>
                <p>When we entered Linz, there were Austrian flags, which are red white red, and I
                    asked myself, these had been verboten during the period of the annexation. And
                    then I took a closer look and they had cut the swastika out of the swastika
                    flag, and put a white bed sheet strip down the middle, so that was red white
                    red. Austria had a famous comic at the time named Hans Moser who composed also
                    some ditties which he sang, and one of these ended with the refrain - “We don't
                    have “character” -in the sense in which Richard Nixon is now being said to have
                    had character, whatever else had been wrong with him [I voted for Richard Nixon
                    in 1960 for President] - but we have a golden heart!”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking now, Richard Nixon died 2 days ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Right.</p>
                <p>“We Austrians have no character but we have a golden heart...” Conditions were
                    not as bad as in most parts of Germany. Vienna had been destroyed to a much more
                    limited extent than other major cities in Germany.</p>

                <p>The wonderful thing which sort of affected my life forever after: The first thing
                    the Russians did after they took Vienna, was to get the two operas going again.
                    The main opera building had been burned out but they put the main opera into the
                    Volksoper, the more popular opera building, and that opera company was put into
                    the Theater an der Wien which they now use for musicals and operetta. That's the
                    first thing, they conquered Vienna in maybe March or April. I spent half a year
                    there from December '45 until June of '46. I went to the opera practically every
                    day and it didn't cost anything. I got a complete basic musical education.</p>
                <p>Vienna was fascinating because it was divided into 4 sectors, one for each of the
                    4 allies. Relations among the 4 allies, including the Soviets, were pretty good
                    but they were already suspicious of each other. My job was to track down members
                    of the former German intelligence services in Austria. There were a lot of them
                    around. Some Germans had stayed in Austria partly because they thought that the
                    Occupation, which was not called Occupation, would be less rigorous and less
                    de-Nazifying than it was in Germany. That was true.</p>
                <p>Many decades later, I discovered that Kurt Waldheim escaped...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary General of the United Nations and President of
                        Austria later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: That's right. And who, it was later discovered, had served with the
                    Abwehr, which was the German military counter intelligence, and was probably
                    co-responsible for war crimes. That was the kind of fellow I was looking for. He
                    went through my fingers.</p>
                <p>Many years later when I was a senior member of the Policy Planning Staff, we were
                    asked whether the US should support Waldheim for a second term as Secretary
                    General of the United Nations. There was a Finnish diplomat named Jacobson who
                    was Finnish and Jewish, who was another candidate running for Secretary General
                    of the UN. And there was some fear that because of Finland's position, he might
                    be subject to Soviet pressures. On the Policy Planning Staff several of the
                    other members and I, who was supposed to know something about Austria, we all
                    had access to all the intelligence that anybody else did. I said Kurt Waldheim
                    was the perfect Viennese head waiter type, and what the UN needed more than
                    anything else at that time was a Viennese head waiter type as Secretary
                    General.</p>
                <p>If we had done a little more digging, both 1946 and 1972 or whenever it was, we
                    might have found out about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't after, at that point we're trying to find
                        people in order to basically both extract information and to perhaps punish.
                        I mean this wasn't trying to resurrect like the Gehlen Organization at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SPIRO: No. I was in charge of an office in the counterintelligence branch in US
                    headquarters in Austria. Which was just suppose to locate these people and to
                    put them in, not to incarcerate, put them in a camp where we held all suspicious
                    characters, especially intelligence. It was just to pick them up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to move on then to get to your Policy Planning
                        job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: I had planned to go to the University of Texas at Austin, where I lived
                    and where I taught for two years from 1989 to 1991.</p>
                <p>While I was in Vienna, in 1946, I got a letter from my mother in San Antonio,
                    about a distant cousin in Houston who'd gotten directly from the army into
                    Harvard College under the GI Bill of Rights. My mother wrote that if Frank David
                    can do this, so can you. So I applied, and I applied to the Law School. I had
                    had one year of junior college. They wrote back very politely that I couldn't
                    get into Law School without having gone to college and I should apply to the
                    College and I did.</p>
                <p>They accepted me and I entered in 1946 and I graduated in 1949 but with the class
                    of 1950, which includes Henry Kissinger and Jim Schlesinger. All 3 of us
                    graduated summa cum laude and then I stayed on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with either?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Yes, I knew both of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came from somewhat similar circumstances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Henry did, Jim was a native New Yorker, Henry had a very similar
                    background except that he comes from Fuerth in Bavaria, a small town. I recently
                    saw a TV conversation between Barbara Walters and him, in Fuerth. She asked him
                    whether he knew anyone of his generation in the town, this little town in
                    Bavaria, very provincial. He conceded his provincial origins, whereas my origins
                    are very cosmopolitan. Maybe I've become very Texas provincial, but of course
                    Texans are not provincial.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>He said, no. He intimated that he really wouldn't want to have anything to do
                    with his contemporaries in Fuerth. He was kicked out of the public school and
                    had to go to the Jewish school very early on. I was then, as I have been on
                    other occasions, starting when I first met him - he entered Harvard in 1947 -
                    impressed by how different my experience was in Hamburg from his in Fuerth.
                    [This is getting to be a very nice conversation.] In Hamburg; I stayed in public
                    school, a very good school, until the very last day it was possible, November 9,
                    1938, and never experienced a single act of anti-Semitism, on the contrary.</p>
                <p>Henry had the same tutor on the Harvard tutorial system, which is one-on-one once
                    a week, a senior faculty member and an undergraduate, modeled on the Oxford and
                    Cambridge tutorial systems. We had the same tutor. He had him for 3 years or 4
                    years and I had him for only my senior year. A man named William Yandell
                    Elliott, who was a very impressive man, a very learned man, a very good teacher.
                    [He] had been a Rhodes scholar himself, and had come out of Tennessee and
                    Vanderbilt, where he played football when Vanderbilt had a great football team,
                    and who had been an advisor to all Secretaries of State starting with his
                    kissing cousin Cordell Hull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, from Tennessee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: He sort of adopted Henry and introduced Henry to Mr. Macloy and Nelson
                    Rockefeller and that's how Henry started his career at the Council on Foreign
                    Relations with the Nuclear Weapons project and so forth. Henry got his Ph.D. in
                    '55, I think. I got mine in '53 at Harvard, I stayed on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What field were you working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Political theory and comparative government. My dissertation, which I was
                    very lucky they let me write, was entitled A Theory of Responsibility in
                    Government. It dealt with questions of bureaucratic responsibility, individual
                    versus collective responsibility under international law (along lines of the
                    Nuremberg Trials), and political parties as transmission belts for citizens'
                    responsibility. It was very philosophic, it was neither a library nor a field
                    work thing, it was a thought work project. It enabled me to develop a systematic
                    political theory which I found useful both in my later writings and in my work
                    and in my life.</p>
                <p>But in 1953 the subject of responsibility in government was of no interest to
                    anyone, not even church related publishers were interested in publishing it. I
                    didn't get it published. I wrote it in 1952 and it wasn't published until 1969.
                    In its original dissertation version, it was not a book but it was a book-length
                    manuscript which later became a book.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Then I had a couple of fellowships including a Fulbright which I used in '53-'54,
                    after I got my Ph.D., to do research and write a book on a new German labor
                    relations scheme called Co-determination. Under it, employees of coal and steel
                    corporations in Germany had an almost 50-50 share in the management and on the
                    supervisory board of directors. That was published by the Harvard University
                    Press in 1958. I've written a total of 13 books, 7 of them my own, the other 6
                    as editor or as co-author.</p>
                <p>The book on German co-determination became very useful to me when I was brand new
                    on the Policy Planning staff in 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we get to the Policy Planning staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: I stayed on at Harvard on the faculty in the Government Department as an
                    instructor and Assistant Professor from '54 to '61. From '61 to '65 I was an
                    Associate Professor of Political Science at Amherst College in western
                    Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not western Massachusetts, middle Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Middle Massachusetts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking to somebody who comes from western
                        Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Where do you come from?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to Williams College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: But the same congressman who represented Williamstown also represented
                    Amherst. He played a very active role on AID, Agency for International
                    Development, legislation. He had an Italian name, a little fellow. That was the
                    seat in Congress</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: James Magregor, who was an instructor when I had him, who
                        ran fourth and wrote a lot about him, he lost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: I thought of that when I ran for Congress for LBJ's old seat two years ago
                    and again this year from Austin, Texas.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Then in 1965 I moved to Philadelphia as a professor of Political Science at the
                    University of Pennsylvania. I'd gotten to know Senator Hugh Scott, who retired
                    as Minority Leader of the Republicans in the Senate, who was a Senator from
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very interested in the Far East too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: He was a senior member of the Commerce Committee of the Senate and as such
                    did a lot of traveling.</p>
                <p>I first met him at my wedding to Elizabeth Petersen of Radnor, Pennsylvania, who
                    was the first Radcliffe tutorial student I had after being a tutor in the
                    Government Department for 7 years at Harvard. Her father, Howard Petersen, had
                    been an Assistant Secretary of War during the Second World War and shortly
                    thereafter, and was a friend of Hugh Scott. I met the Scotts first at our
                    wedding in 1958.</p>
                <p>In 1959-60, my now ex-wife then new bride, Elizabeth Petersen Spiro—Clark now,
                    just remarried recently to Warren Clark, a career FSO and Williams alumnus— ...I
                    had three or four Fellowships to study the constitutional politics of the
                    Federation of Rhodesia and the Nyasaland, now the countries of Zimbabwe, Zambia
                    and Malawi. We were living in Salisbury, now Harare, and Senator Scott came
                    through on a trip for the Senate Commerce Committee. We renewed our
                    acquaintance.</p>
                <p>In 1967 to '68, from the University of Pennsylvania, I had a couple of
                    fellowships, and a leave to spend a year at Oxford and in London, to study the
                    origins of the adversary process of the common law. Senator Scott spent a term
                    at Oxford as a visiting Lecturer at Balliol College and we deepened our
                    friendship. As I think I mentioned a little bit earlier, I had voted for Richard
                    Nixon when I was a young Assistant Professor at Harvard, where this was not a
                    popular thing to do. It maybe one reason why I didn't stay at Harvard and I've
                    never had any regrets about that.</p>
                <p>Senator Scott knew of my support for Nixon, who was then elected in 1968, and
                    Scott started in 1969 to recommend me to Elliot Richardson—he's been on TV all
                    over the place about the “Saturday night massacre,” in connection with President
                    Nixon's death two days ago. In the Summer of '69 I received a very tentative
                    inquiry from the acting head of the Policy Planning Staff, whether I'd be
                    interested in becoming a consultant. And I said I would and I did become a
                    consultant for a few months in early 1970 and then a full time member starting
                    July 1, 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were, I always like to get the dates, how long
                        were you doing and until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SPIRO: I did that for exactly five years. I was told by Miriam Camps, who was the
                    acting head of the Policy Planning staff, that Elliot Richardson, who was then
                    Under Secretary of State, the number two man in those days to William Rogers who
                    was the Secretary, had sent them this dossier that said, “We have a Republican
                    who's been recommended by a Republican Senator to be a member of the Policy
                    Planning Staff. And they said, that's horrible, we don't want any political
                    appointees.</p>
                <p>So they looked forward with great trepidation to getting this file and they
                    looked at the file and said, “This can't be true, somebody with this kind of a
                    record cannot be a Republican and if he is, he wouldn't be recommended by the
                    Republicans because they're all hawks.”</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened after I made this first trip to Europe for
                    the State Department, where I was mistaken for a nepotistic nephew of Spiro
                    Agnew some time in 1970, George Meany, who was the head of the AFL/CIO, had
                    breakfast with President Nixon and Secretary of State William Rogers. [He]
                    complained about the Labor Attach�s service in the State Department, even at
                    that time. I would think by now almost all of our embassies have Labor Attach�s,
                    who are responsible for contacts with local labor unions and labor
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>The AFL/CIO has always wanted to get control over them, or to have them consist
                    exclusively of nominees of the labor unions. He complained about that in the
                    course of having breakfast with the President, and so Nixon turned to Secretary
                    of State Rogers and said, “Bill, will you look into this for me.” And Rogers
                    went back to the State Department and called William Macomber who was Under
                    Secretary for Management and said, “Bill, will you look into this for me.” And
                    Macomber called in the Director of the Policy Planning Staff, which was then
                    called Planning and Coordination Staff, William Cargo and said, “Bill, will you
                    look into this for me.”</p>
                <p>Bill Cargo got a bunch of us, the staff is quite small, about 12 or 15, mainly
                    career Foreign Service officers or civil servants, and said, we've got to look
                    into this, set up a working group. I—having had this experience with both German
                    and American labor leaders doing my research on the German Co-determination
                    scheme; and having had lots of contacts with Americans, who were interested in
                    this and who were a little worried about this, and at the same time thought
                    maybe they could copy aspects of it— I volunteered, although I'd been taught in
                    the army never to volunteer for anything, but this seemed different.</p>
                <p>In the course of doing this work, where we also visited the Labor Department, and
                    the Commerce Department, and other departments in the Executive Branch. I
                    discovered what I call, “Spiro's Law of Replication,” about which I have a long
                    manuscript, which I wrote when I was a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson
                    International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian in Washington, after we
                    came back from Cameroon.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The law is very simple, it says that: In all modern governments, each Ministry or
                    each Department replicates the structure of the government as a whole; within
                    each department, each bureau or lower level office replicates, to the extent
                    this is possible, the overall structure of the department.</p>
                <p>And then a corollary of this is: That each department of the Executive Branch in
                    our Federal government contains miniature replicas of every other department.
                    There were little Labor Departments in the State Department, there were little
                    State Departments, there were little Justice Departments, there are little CIAs
                    and FBIs, little Treasury and Commerce, in every other department. This makes
                    for good communication maybe and it makes for proliferation and redundancy.</p>
                <p>I recommended to successive Presidents and Directors of OMB, that an easy way to
                    reduce spending is by reducing or eliminating some of the miniature replicas.
                    But I had thought, and this is really to the point of what I did later and what
                    I did before, I had thought that I could be of major use to my colleagues in the
                    Policy Planning Staff, and to the State Department as a whole, because of my
                    substantive experience doing a lot of work on European governments, especially
                    Germany, and on Africa.</p>
                <p>By this time, I'd written a couple of comparative government textbooks, and by
                    virtue of my substantive knowledge of politics in Africa, because also by this
                    time we'd spent a total of maybe a year and a half mainly in Rhodesia and
                    Nyasaland but traveling all over Africa. I published one book in '62 entitled
                    Politics in Africa, Prospects South of the Sahara and other books, Africa, the
                    Primacy of Politics, I was regarded also as an African expert.</p>
                <p>But of course the Foreign Service officers were just as qualified in terms of
                    substance. So I discovered, to my surprise, that the main contribution I could
                    make at that level, was what I called “Conceptual Planning,” coming in with new
                    ideas, new concepts. And three years after I started, when President Nixon
                    nominated Henry Kissinger to be Secretary of State, the first thing that
                    Kissinger did was to send a message around to everybody in the Department. He
                    said, among other things, that he would insist on “better analytical and more
                    conceptual reporting.”</p>
                <p>As a member of the Planning Staff, I attended the weekly meetings of the
                    Assistant Secretaries for Europe and for Africa, every week. At that time Arthur
                    Hartman, who was later Ambassador to France and to the Soviet Union (did you do
                    an oral history?) was Assistant Secretary to European Affairs and I attended
                    that weekly meeting. There were a bunch of senior Foreign Service officers
                    sitting around a long table and they understood what Kissinger meant when he
                    said “better analytical reporting” but they didn't know what “more conceptual
                    reporting” meant.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>So I volunteered. Since he grew up with German as his first language and he might
                    still be thinking in German, sometimes he sounds like it: The German word for
                    concept is Begriff and it means handle, like a doorknob is a Turgriff, I assumed
                    what he meant, and this was verified later on, was that we needed to get better
                    handles, by means of which, to pick up new and changing realities, data, facts.
                    And that the old handles, the old concepts, were no longer adequate. It was that
                    sort of contribution much more than my detailed, factual, even my analytical
                    knowledge, that was useful on the Planning Staff.</p>
                <p>All along Senator Scott had tried, through the White House, to get me a higher
                    appointment in the Department or an Ambassadorial appointment. And that finally
                    had results in March, April of 1975 when President Ford nominated me to be
                    Ambassador to Cameroon and concurrently to Equatorial Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:: Before we get to that, can you tell me, what was your
                        concept or feel about the role of the Policy Planning at that time you were
                        there? Because right now it's considered practically dissolved and other
                        times it's been up, other times it's been down. So we're talking about the
                        '70 to '75 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: That was always being discussed. Under William Cargo, who was a career
                    officer who later became Ambassador to Nepal, you have him on tape?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't want to be interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: He was a very correct and very nonpolitical officer, very good. One who
                    had, before he entered the Foreign Service, gotten a Ph.D. in Political Science
                    from the University of Michigan.</p>
                <p>Some people on the Staff, and some others thought, that it was down at that time
                    because it didn't have a political appointee. You know this was Walt Rostow's
                    former bailiwick (who is living, and I just saw him and his wife Elspeth, in
                    Austin at the supermarket), who'd been the Chairman of the Policy Planning
                    Council, as they called it in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and then
                    before Deputy and afterwards Senior Assistant to the President for National
                    Security Affairs on the NSC.</p>
                <p>My own feeling was that because Cargo did not have entree to Bill Rogers, the
                    Secretary, the staff could actually concern itself with long term foreign policy
                    planning, and we did. We wrote a lot of planning papers, and made some studies,
                    and tried to sort of push the geographical and functional bureaus in the
                    direction of the US role in a world of interdependence.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I take credit for reintroducing and refilling with substantive meaning, the
                    concept of interdependence in official US foreign policy, including the “state
                    of the world” reports that President Nixon issued, several of which were taken
                    much more seriously by foreign governments, than they were taken by the Congress
                    or by people in this country.</p>
                <p>Serious work was being done. And besides that, the Policy Planning Staff of the
                    State Department is a nice case study in replication. No foreign ministry in the
                    world had one until Secretary of State George Marshall, General Marshall became
                    Secretary of State under Harry Truman, and he had been used to planning from the
                    military. Because the Prussian military, when they reformed in the 19th century,
                    established a Department of the General Staff which was concerned with planning.
                    And the US army like all good armies replicated the Prussian setup.</p>
                <p>So George Marshall one day turned to Dean Acheson, his Under Secretary, and said,
                    “Where do we plan in the Department?” And Dean Acheson said, “We don't.” “Well,
                    set up a Planning Staff.” So Acheson called over George Kennan, recently
                    returned from Embassy Moscow and teaching at the National War College, as it was
                    still called, and said, “George, the General wants a Planning Staff so set one
                    up.”</p>
                <p>So on May 27, 1947, just before Marshall gave his Marshall Plan speech at
                    Harvard, which I didn't hear because I went home for the summer vacation, the
                    Policy Planning Staff was founded.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, by the time that I got to the Planning Staff,
                    practically every other respectable government in the world had set up a Foreign
                    Ministry planning staff, which was more or less a replica of, and influenced by,
                    the US State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, talking about, particularly about the
                        Kissinger time when he was sort of running it, how did he use it? I want to
                        say, one thing that has come out of many of these conversations, that
                        Kissinger tended to see everything in bipolar ways. That the Middle East and
                        Africa were really not East-West, you know, Soviet Union versus the United
                        States problems. Sometimes things would get mixed up because of this. Did
                        this ever count as a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SPIRO: Shortly before Kissinger became Secretary, Cargo went somewhere else maybe
                    to Nepal. A splendid Foreign Service officer, whom I recommended for the
                    Harriman prize which he got in 1973, named James Sutterlin, became the Director
                    of the Policy Planning Staff. He left and became the Senior Advisor to the
                    Secretary General of the UN. Henry brought with him, from the NSC staff, Winston
                    Lord, who is now Assistant Secretary for the Far East and who, in between, was
                    Ambassador to China. Before that, and after the end of the Ford administration,
                    he was the President of the Council on Foreign Relations, of which I, and many
                    other former Ambassadors, and present Ambassadors are members. I've been a
                    member for more than 20 years.</p>
                <p>When Winston Lord became Director of Policy Planning, the functions of the staff
                    changed because Winston was very close and had instant access to Henry. In some
                    ways this raised the prestige of the staff, but in other ways it just made
                    members of the staff go-betweens, who did a lot of operational work and who
                    became sort of desk officers for special problems in the areas on top of the
                    actual desk officers. And the staff was used to do things that the Secretary,
                    meaning Kissinger, was interested in.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't a simple matter of when the head has access to the Secretary, the
                    staff is on top of the world, and when it doesn't, it's out of the loop. It's
                    much more complicated than that. For example, shortly before Kissinger came, the
                    Secretary's speech writers were made members of the Policy Planning Staff, they
                    had not been that before, which enabled the staff to put in things that they, as
                    individuals or as members of the Policy Planning Staff, thought should get into
                    a speech. The best way to start a new policy, or to launch a trial balloon, was
                    through speeches by the Secretary and presidential speeches to which the State
                    Department was asked to make contributions.</p>
                <p>A sort of minor example of this, but maybe just the sort of thing that historians
                    would be interested in: Shortly after Kissinger became Secretary in September of
                    1973, his speech for the United Nations General Assembly was being prepared, as
                    it always is at that season. The speechwriters were a young career officer named
                    Mark Palmer, who ended up his career as Ambassador to Budapest and is now
                    running ex-Ambassador Lauder's real estate operations around Check Point Charlie
                    in Berlin. And I had recommended from the outside, a former student of mine at
                    Amherst, named Lawrence Mead, who is now a professor of government at NYU and is
                    a visiting professor at the Kennedy School at Harvard, and has become a great
                    specialist on poverty on which he wrote a book which was dedicated to me
                    recently.</p>
                <p>Larry Mead got a job for half a year as the number two speech writer for
                    Kissinger. Seconded, as the British would say, from HEW where he was sort of an
                    intern, having gotten his Ph.D. at Harvard. Richardson was then Secretary of
                    HEW. Richardson has held more Cabinet positions than anybody in American history
                    and also was Ambassador to the Court of Saint James' and to the Law of the Seas
                    conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The Bureau of International Organization Affairs sent up as a contribution to
                    Kissinger's speech to the UN General Assembly, a sentence which said: The United
                    States commits itself to support the worldwide fight against schistosomiasis. Do
                    you know what schistosomiasis is? It's also known as Bilharzia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the disease that gets into the liver or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Yes, it ends up in the liver, it gets into the blood stream through
                    microscopic snails that invade the body when you bathe or wade in stagnant
                    tropical waters.</p>
                <p>The people who were vetoing this, including the speechwriters, but also the then
                    Director of the Planning Staff, said, “What's this?” It so happened that a
                    friend of mine named Kenneth Warren (MD), who had graduated from Harvard and its
                    Medical School, Ken earlier had done his service in the Public Health Service
                    here in Washington, and he was already becoming and he has since become one of
                    the great experts on schistosomiasis. I knew all about the disease so I
                    explained it to the speechwriters.</p>
                <p>I called Kenneth Warren, who by this time was the Vice President and Director of
                    Health Sciences for the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, whether there was
                    anything going on. He came down and had a long session with the Health people in
                    the Bureau of International Organization Affairs. Kissinger had a habit of,
                    first time around, not even reading speech drafts but throwing them at the
                    speechwriters and saying, “This is a D, this is beneath contempt.”</p>
                <p>When I first suggested we actually do something on schistosomiasis, the
                    speechwriter said, or somebody said, “He won't be able to pronounce it.” The
                    long and short of it is that he accepted it, it was in the speech, he delivered
                    it, he pronounced it right, and the United States committed itself to, I don't
                    know, a few million dollars. This has had the result that there's much less
                    schistosomiasis in the world today than there was in 1973. And that it is the
                    kind of, on the surface of it, it's not a very grand contribution that you can
                    make, but it all adds up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your appointment to be Ambassador come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Senator Scott had been asking the appointments people in the White House
                    for a couple of years, and there was a vacancy, and it was considered suitable.
                    It turned out to be much more suitable than anybody could have imagined.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I'd gone to Hamburg because an uncle, who had left Hamburg and gotten stuck in
                    Shanghai in 1941 and then after the war joined my parents in San Antonio, had
                    gone back to Hamburg in 1956 and he died in March of '75 and I'd gone back for
                    the funeral. When I came back, Larry Eagleburger who was Kissinger's Executive
                    Assistant, called me in and said that I was about to be nominated to Cameroon
                    and Equatorial Guinea concurrently and was that all right. I said, it was
                    fine.</p>
                <p>The amusing thing was that Cameroon got started as a German colony, but Bismarck
                    didn't really want any colonies in Africa. And Bismarck said at one point, “I'll
                    be damned if I'm going to permit the establishment of a German colonial empire
                    on the French model.” But there were some very persistent rich merchants in
                    Hamburg who kept pestering Bismarck, who had his estate near the city, and he
                    finally gave in, they were so persistent. A German consul, who signed up native
                    chiefs for treaties of allegiance and support, got to the Cameroon coast just
                    before a British consul with the same mission.</p>
                <p>Cameroon is the only country named after shrimp. And it still has the best shrimp
                    fishing banks in the world and the American company, General Foods, which runs a
                    large shrimp trawling fleet, in one of whose trawlers my younger son and I went
                    out, which is one of the sort of activities that ambassadors engage in.</p>
                <p>The British consul was late, so it became a German colony which was then divided
                    between France and Britain as League of Nations mandates, which became United
                    Nations trust territories after the Second World War. But it started as a German
                    colony.</p>
                <p>I was sworn in on August 1, 1975, at precisely the time that President Ford and
                    Henry Kissinger were at the European Security Conference in Helsinki, Finland,
                    which meant he couldn't be in my swearing in. I'd invited a couple of
                    Ambassadors whom I knew, including the German Ambassador von Staden, to the
                    swearing-in ceremony. And he had told me beforehand, or one of his top embassy
                    officers, that I must have been selected by the famous State Department
                    personnel computer because I was from Hamburg and Cameroon had really been more
                    of a Hamburg colony than a German colony.</p>
                <p>The idea of a State Department personnel computer was so ridiculous and so
                    off-beam and so contrary to the arbitrary method by which both political and
                    career officers were picked to be Ambassadors. I mentioned this in my little
                    acceptance speech.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>But it came about because Hugh Scott thought I'd be very good and because, this
                    was not soon after Henry became Secretary, it was soon after Ford became
                    President. Hugh Scott and Jerry Ford were very close to each other, Hugh being
                    the Republican leader in the Senate and Jerry in the House. In fact, Senator
                    Scott had told me that before President Nixon picked Jerry Ford to be Spiro
                    Agnew's successor, he called both of them in and Hugh Scott might just as well
                    have become Vice President. Anyway, I'm sure it was because the Ford White House
                    was more responsive to Senator's Scott's proposals than the Nixon White
                    House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation, we're talking about the '75
                        period, both in Cameroon and in Equatorial Guinea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Cameroon was very good, a man who'd been President since independence,
                    very solid, conservative, unflamboyant man, Amadou Ahidjo. They had just found
                    oil but they went about its development very slowly and they didn't make
                    excessive promises. The human rights situation was better than in most other
                    African countries. They were genuinely nonaligned, they had for example both
                    South Korean and North Korean Embassies, they had Soviet and Chinese Embassies,
                    they were responsive to our proposals. I've always thought that our AID was the
                    worst of our Foreign Services, and we can talk about that. They made very good
                    use of our Peace Corps people who were superb young people.</p>
                <p>Washington wasn't much interested in it. We had to work very hard to get them to
                    vote with us on issues like the perennial Cuban resolution at the UN that Puerto
                    Rico was a colony. We had to persuade them that it wasn't and then they would
                    vote with us or abstain, being actually honestly nonaligned.</p>
                <p>At one point Ambassador Scranton, who was then our Ambassador to the UN and who
                    had been the Governor of Pennsylvania, from whence I knew him slightly, made the
                    annual trip of the American Ambassador of the United Nations to certain key
                    countries in order to get them to vote with us on certain key issues at the UN.
                    He came in time for our observance of the bicentennial of the Declaration of
                    Independence. He came about 2 weeks before July 4, 1976, so that I had our
                    ceremony which was a Vin d'honneur, a champagne cocktail party, to which I
                    invited the entire Cameroonian government from the President on down, which had
                    never been done, they'd never been in an embassy before, they all came and
                    Scranton was the Guest of Honor. We had very nice little speeches about the
                    Declaration of Independence, and independence and the meaning of it, and
                    freedom, which was perfectly well received, but proclaimed a concept of freedom
                    which went beyond anything that you can find anywhere in Africa even today.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Anyway, so we had to work very hard and they usually went along with us. The nice
                    thing was that Washington didn't really care for other things and they were
                    fairly responsive to my suggestions. We had no congressional delegations
                    visiting except on a private visit. Congressman Quie, who later became Governor
                    of his home state Minnesota, was visiting his sister who was with a Lutheran
                    mission hospital.</p>
                <p>The AID people were resistant and stupid and self-serving with a few exceptions.
                    I think one reason for that was that most of them had to be placed somewhere,
                    they'd been in Vietnam, and Cameroon is four-fifths Francophone and one-fifth
                    Anglophone, although both languages have constitutionally equal rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They'd just been kicked out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: They were sent to us. I had one major experience which we may want to get
                    back to, I'll just talk about it briefly. Cameroon had completed a railroad from
                    the Port of Douala, where we had a consulate, to Ngoundere, a town about 200
                    miles up country. They were then engaged in extending that railroad further to
                    the north. All the European countries and Canada, which had a particular
                    interest in Cameroon because it is also bilingual and bicultural in the same two
                    languages, were supporting this, and the World Bank was supporting it. And the
                    United States was being advised not to support it by these stupid and
                    recalcitrant and self-serving AID characters. Not so much the ones in country or
                    the country director but a man in Washington, one of many bureaucrats, who said
                    that United States can't support it because it's against the law to give support
                    for railroad projects.</p>
                <p>I went home for consultations, which I couldn't do on State Department money
                    because we were on a tight budget. The AID officers from Washington could do
                    more traveling than an Ambassador. I happened to have got an invitation to give
                    a lecture at Heidelberg University in Germany, so I piggybacked my Washington
                    trip on the Heidelberg thing, for which I had to get approval from the
                    Department, which I got.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Before I went to see the AID people, I went to see a Harvard contemporary of
                    mine, John Brademas, who was Democratic Majority Whip, and I told him what the
                    problem was and that Cameroon had a very responsible government and they were
                    developing in a serious way. He sent me to a Pennsylvania congressman, whose
                    name I've forgotten. I first went to see (Republican) Congressman Larry
                    Coughlin, who just retired in the last election, he didn't run for reelection,
                    whom I'd known from Philadelphia and he passed me on to this Pennsylvania
                    Democrat who was an expert on the AID legislation. He explained to me that it
                    was not only not against the law, but that the law specifically provided that,
                    where the United States had previously helped with a railroad project and/or the
                    railroad project was likely to help other countries in the region—and this one
                    going up North would help Chad and the Central African Republic—there were
                    several others, and if it fulfilled any one of those requirements, it was not
                    only covered by the law, there were extra funds provided for it, ready for
                    it.</p>
                <p>So after a long and fairly bitter fight, in which the AID bureaucrat fought
                    dirty, like not sending me wires of information, it was pushed through and the
                    United States participated in this aid for the extension of this railroad, which
                    became a great success. But the funny thing was, two years after I'd come
                    back—after Jimmy Carter in the first of many major mistakes, accepted my
                    routinely rendered resignation — you can hear that that is a rehearsed phrase, I
                    use it often—I ran into this local AID bureaucrat who said, “Well Mr.
                    Ambassador, I got your project through,” which he had fought tooth and nail. Not
                    only that, but he was the guy who was put in charge of a number of African
                    regional railroad upgrading programs for AID on the Washington end.</p>
                <p>But it was a well run country where it was pleasant to be Ambassador. It was
                    interesting for other reasons because they were put together along with many
                    other African countries in this artificial way. There are 200 languages in
                    Cameroon because they'd gone through the German colonial experience which was
                    pretty rigorous. The Germans were pretty nasty and sometimes brutal colonial
                    masters, and then the very different French and British. And they committed
                    themselves to working together between these 2 or 3 traditions.</p>
                <p>They, and this is a long story very briefly told, they'd become natural
                    diplomats, they had to get along among themselves. They had therefore supplied
                    many diplomats for the African continental plan, for the OAU, for example, and
                    for the UN. The Chairman, of what later became the first Committee of the Law of
                    the Seas Conference, was a Cameroonian, a senior career Cameroonian diplomat.
                    And that meant that when Richardson had become Ambassador for the Law of the
                    Seas, by this time we're early in the Carter administration, he sent two of his
                    principal aides who had been with him before at Defense and Justice and
                    everywhere else I think. One of whom was Richard Dorman who later became OMB
                    Director and the other one was the son of Ambassador Smith who'd been the
                    Ambassador to the SALT negotiations, way back. They came over to Cameroon in
                    order to meet with this Cameroonian diplomat who was the head of the main
                    committee of the Law of the Seas Conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Cameroon was fine, it was fun. Incidentally, since this is about becoming an
                    Ambassador, before I presented my Letters of Credence to President Ahidjo, there
                    was the annual Peace Corps volunteer conference in the capitol at a local hotel.
                    The volunteers who had been there for one or two years came back to exchange
                    information. I was asked to come to that conference and to meet the volunteers
                    and to give them a pep talk.</p>
                <p>I'd seen lots of Ambassadors in operation, but I had not been an Ambassador
                    before, and I'd seen lots of movies. And what does an Ambassador do at a more or
                    less ceremonial thing like this—the beginning of a conference in a hotel, no
                    functioning yet because he hasn't presented his credentials. So I went around
                    and did what both Ambassadors and politicians do, I went around and said (there
                    was this guy with me who would say, “This is Ambassador Spiro.”), I'd say, “How
                    are you and where are you from?” Expecting them to say, Williamstown,
                    Massachusetts or Austin, Texas or Berkeley, California. But without exception
                    they answered with the name of the town or village in Cameroon where they were
                    stationed, they had completely identified in one or two years with their
                    Cameroonian hosts.</p>
                <p>Then during our tour, I'm including Betsy in this, obviously she was a very good
                    Ambassador's wife and more than that. She actually, while we were there in 1976,
                    wrote a pioneering article on the role that human rights should play in American
                    foreign policy. When the Carter-Ford debate took place, we heard it over
                    short-wave, it sounded like Betsy Spiro in the voice of Carter, and Betsy Spiro
                    in the voice of Ford, talking to each other. Speech writers, or advisors to both
                    of them, had read this article which was published just in time for the
                    campaign. Appropriately, Betsy is now Deputy Director of an office in the Bureau
                    of Human Rights.</p>
                <p>We visited many Peace Corps volunteers in backwoods places and they were really
                    doing a splendid job. Which surprised me because when the Peace Corps was first
                    invented by President Kennedy, I was very critical of it because in the
                    beginning it looked like a bunch of rich kids just wanting to do their “tour”
                    abroad. In the beginning, I think it tended to be that way.</p>
                <p>Cameroon was fine and there were no problems and they made use of my special
                    qualities. The majority of them, and the dominant component in the government of
                    Cameroon, were the Francophones, although the fifth of the population that was
                    Anglophone, had more than proportional representation. But the Francophones were
                    dominant. In their Parliament and in their Cabinet they always had simultaneous
                    translation.</p>
                <p>But the Francophones especially, like the French at home, have enormous respect
                    for intellectuals, I never considered myself an intellectual, we don't have an
                    intellectual class, but they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had the professorial, you'd written things</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SPIRO: I was a professor. I had brought deliberately, I think I had to get
                    special permission to take the major part of my library along. We had
                    bookshelves constructed in the Residence and that impressed them and that got me
                    entree where my predecessors and successors would not have had it. I was asked
                    to give a lecture at the university which was otherwise very reluctant to have
                    political foreigners.</p>
                <p>It also meant, I'm almost as down on the US Information Service as I am on AID of
                    that period, it may have improved although I doubt it. We had some really bad
                    USIS people, except for the junior persons. One failure that I had, we had a
                    second tour woman who was the Press Officer under USIS who had served somewhere
                    else before, a young college graduate. She was the only junior or mid-level
                    person in the embassy, who constantly had all sorts of local journalists and
                    other intellectuals at her home to entertain, including especially Africans,
                    Cameroonians.</p>
                <p>So I recommended her for a Meritorious Service Award at the end of my first year.
                    The Public Affairs Officer, a fellow named Jerry Prillaman—who rose to heights
                    later on, not on my recommendation—said, you can't do this without my approval.
                    It turned out to be true, an Ambassador cannot recommend for special awards AID
                    or USIA officers, he has to get the Country Director's or the Public Affairs
                    Officer's permission. His excuse was, this would be very bad for her career if
                    she gets recognition too early. She did not get the recognition then but I think
                    she's had a successful career since then.</p>
                <p>I had made a couple of trips to the northern-most province and provincial capital
                    called Maroua, partly because it was near a wonderful, totally natural, national
                    park, lots of elephants and animals in it. We had only one consulate in Douala,
                    the port city, but there was a wonderful AID officer named Tex Ford, who's
                    obviously from Texas, in Maroua who had been with AID since he was a Young
                    Farmer of America, probably growing alfalfa in Texas. And he'd gotten several
                    awards for work he'd done in Latin America and he'd been in Vietnam and I think
                    in the Philippines, he's great.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, a Jehovah Witness missionary had strayed across the Chad border
                    into Cameroon, he'd been held, as an illegal immigrant. The plane that normally
                    went up to that city, which was 300 miles away from Maroua where Tex Ford was
                    stationed for AID, was grounded, so our consular officer, another young woman,
                    couldn't fly up to get the missionary released. So Tex Ford drove his Land
                    Rover, or his jeep, to the other town, the border town. And he knew everybody
                    there because he'd gone around distributing Carter peanut seeds from the Carter
                    peanut seed farm. He knew everybody, they loved him, he was nice, he's a Texan,
                    he was jolly, you'd get along with him, a tall fellow. And he got the missionary
                    sprung.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>And then the US Information Service people had habitually, from the time of
                    independence, sent the same French-speaking American professors to the same
                    countries—because they happened to know them, because they were there, and they
                    spoke French and there was a kind of symbiotic relationship between the
                    potential pool of speakers and French West African colonies. Some of them were
                    okay but most of them were dull and they got duller as time wore on.</p>
                <p>I tried to get Stanley Hoffman to come and he couldn't and I tried to get
                    Lawrence Wiley, name mean anything to you? A famous Harvard professor who wrote
                    a famous book in the 50s about a little southern French village. These were well
                    known in Cameroon and elsewhere. I finally was able to get Professor Nicholas
                    Wahl, who was then at Princeton and is now the head of the French center at NYU,
                    to come out. This is after Carter's election and before Christmas of 1976.</p>
                <p>I asked the USIS people to set up as many occasions for him to speak, in a
                    two-week period, as possible and especially to include Maroua in the far north
                    of Cameroon. Jerry said, well, we've never done anything up there before. I
                    said, well, you do it now. Well, we don't have anybody up there. So I got on the
                    phone to Tex Ford and I said, can you do this? To make another long story short,
                    it's an interesting one. He got 300 people to come, all the elite of the
                    northern province and it was an enormous success. With prodding, Prillaman and
                    the others set-up a meeting that was attended by 1200 in Ngoundere, it was the
                    centrally located provincial capital. But it was very hard to get them into
                    this.</p>
                <p>Then I tried, and this time I succeeded, to get Meritorious Service Awards, two
                    of them, for Tex Ford, from the State Department for his consular services, he
                    got that, he didn't get the USIS one but in the end he got that one too. But
                    there was just this recalcitrance and “service narrowness.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's reaching down, they want the award, not you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Right, but I wanted to place it with somebody who had done extraordinary
                    things, beyond and above the call of duty and of his bureaucratic niche.</p>
                <p>Equatorial Guinea was a totally different story and one that I've written up. The
                    Spanish had done nothing for their colonies, they pushed Equatorial Guinea into
                    independence for totally ulterior motives before there was any preparation. The
                    motive was to get Third World countries to vote with Spain on the issue of
                    Gibraltar at the United Nations. There was no independence movement. There were
                    no college trained people.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>There were 2 separate colonies, Fernando Po, the island, which physically looks
                    very much like the big island of Hawaii, and Rio Muni, the mainland colony
                    inhabited by 2 different tribes. Spain pushed Equatorial New Guinea, as the
                    combination of these two, into independence and under a brutal tyrant named
                    Macias who belonged to the dominant tribe. He instituted a brutal regime which
                    led to the flight from the country of about 300,000 Equatorial Guineans, many
                    whom went to Spain.</p>
                <p>We never had a resident embassy there, we had a Charg� d'affaires and one
                    communicator. When I was on the Policy Planning Staff, this is a dark chapter in
                    the history of the Foreign Service, do you know anything about this in 1970? Do
                    you have any others on record on this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I have somebody but you might explain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: The Ambassador to Cameroon was also concurrently assigned to Equatorial
                    Guinea, he would visit twice a year. In 1970, maybe it was a little later when I
                    was on the Planning Staff, I got all the cables from Africa. There were these
                    frantic cables from the Charg� in Fernando Po, which has been renamed by the
                    brutal dictator, that a vast Soviet fleet was assembling around the island and
                    was about to take it over.</p>
                <p>What actually happened was that the Charg� murdered the communicator, for which
                    he later served 7 years in a federal prison, I think. He possibly went mad
                    because the embassy was right next-door to the prison and I was told that he
                    could hear the screams of the prisoners as they were being tortured night and
                    day. There were also intimations of homosexuality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think there was physical evidence of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: There was physical evidence. Then, very much to his credit, the Nigerian
                    Ambassador in Equatorial New Guinea, who was a former Colonel in the Nigerian
                    military regime of the previous period of the civil war, saw to it that the
                    Charg� was gotten out, sort of under guard. He was flown from Douala to
                    Washington and arrested at the airport and tried and sentenced. Then he joined
                    the retired Foreign Service officers club, I think.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there was this background in US-Equatorial Guinean relations. We couldn't
                    be too loud because we had a Charg� who went mad.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So I was appointed concurrently to both, I presented my credentials to Macias in
                    the company of the man who was then our consul in Douala, who later became my
                    DCM, an FSO named Bill Mithoefer. That was like something out of Evelyn Waugh's
                    novel, Scoop. We took along an LP record of the Star Spangled Banner and a bunch
                    of football songs because they had said that they wanted their National Guard to
                    play the two National Anthems when I presented my credentials. We were worried
                    they'd play, you know, “Fair Harvard” or “On Wisconsin,” but they actually
                    played the National Anthem, it was a pretty good rendition. I was able to use my
                    Spanish from San Antonio, I had an interesting conversation with Macias who's
                    Spanish is excellent but who, as I have said, was a brutal tyrant.</p>
                <p>Lots of resident Ambassadors in Yaounde, Cameroon, would make 2 trips a year to
                    Fernando Po. We always took along bags of bread and rolls because Macias had
                    declared that bread was a colonial invention, and would not permit flour to be
                    ground or imported, so that you didn't have any bread coming out from the
                    mainland to the diplomats who were stationed there - that was really a hardship
                    post. We closed it after the murder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, it really didn't make much sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: But it was reopened in the Reagan administration, I think. One of Senator
                    Jesse Helms' aides for whom he insisted on getting an appointment, barring which
                    he would not let someone else be confirmed, got that appointment. Apparently it
                    hadn't approved very much.</p>
                <p>It was interesting being on the island. It reminded me very much of Hawaii and
                    they had a Spanish cattle ranch high up. They had, until a few years before
                    that, they imported thousands of Nigerian Ibo workers because the local tribe
                    didn't like to do that kind of work. The Ibo workers were being exploited and
                    persecuted. The Nigerian government in an expedition, again headed by this
                    wonderful Ambassador who had brought out our murdering Charg�, had evacuated
                    6,000 Ibo workers. Since then the production of cocoa, and this is one of the
                    best cocoa beans from Equatorial Guinea, from the island, had a higher cocoa
                    butter content which is how you measure them, than any other cocoa in the world.
                    It had been most productive but after the Ibos were evacuated by the Nigerian
                    government, it went down. Things were just awful.</p>
                <p>President Macias had invited me to visit the mainland colony on the occasion of
                    the day on which they celebrate the final victory over colonialism. So the
                    Consul, who had meanwhile become my DCM, and I, in a Peugeot, drove for 3 hours
                    to the Equatorial Guinea-Cameroon border in March of 1976. At the border we were
                    greeted by people who beat the ground with branches cut from bushes, and “Abajo
                    el colonialismo Espanol,” down with Spanish colonialism and then they lift up
                    the bushes and “Arriba el gran maestro,” long live the great teacher of the
                    people, etc., etc., about 10 different titles, Macias.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>This is a separate story which I have written up and I'll be glad to send you
                    copies of it, I don't want to take any time with it now.</p>
                <p>I spent a bizarre 3 days there. At the border, it's sort of a no man's land
                    between the 2 countries. The Chief of Protocol, who escorted me back to the
                    border, accused me of being not an Ambassador but an assassin and a spy; and he
                    accused President Nixon, who was not in office any more, of being a communist
                    and a spy; and he denied that his President, who had visited China, was a
                    communist; and it was really bizarre. We were in no man's land. I feared for my
                    life for a while, because they could have shot me if they wanted to.</p>
                <p>We figured it out afterwards, that they'd been planning to create a diplomatic
                    incident which would get them publicity. But that didn't happen and we drove the
                    3 hours back to Yaounde and I sent a cable to the Department recommending that
                    we break relations. Meanwhile, they had gotten a commercial telegram because
                    Cameroon did not have an Ambassador in Washington, they did have one at the UN,
                    declaring me and the DCM, “personae non gratae.” The US government then
                    suspended diplomatic relations with them and instructed me to present the
                    Demarche stating that, to the Equatorial Guinean Ambassador in Yaounde, which I
                    did. Whereupon he asked for asylum from the Cameroon government, he didn't want
                    to take that message back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had anything happened during your trip other than the</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Yes, a number of things had happened. First I had a conversation with the
                    President which went off perfectly well. I was lying on the beach, they have
                    beautiful beaches, and dreaming of all sorts of wonderful things that a really
                    good American AID program could do with them, with all the talented and savvy
                    Spanish speaking Mexican-Americans we have in Texas. It would be just great for
                    tourism and the mainland counties had rich country, pigs running around and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>And then we were invited, I'd expressed interest in it, to go to an up-country
                    lumber, precious woods plantation which was being run by a French company and a
                    French manager. We flew up there and we had tea with the French manager in the
                    presence of the Chief of Protocol from the Presidency, who later turned out to
                    be the villain.</p>
                <p>I looked, as I often do, it's a terribly impolite thing to do, I looked at the
                    teacup which we were served the tea in, to see where it came from. Oh, I said,
                    this [china] is from China. These were French people, so one of the charges
                    against me was that I said they were communists. I had said nothing about the
                    President's trip to China, I don't think I knew about it, I didn't care about
                    it. We were beginning to have non-diplomatic relations with the mainland Chinese
                    by this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time we'd had relations with China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: Oh sure. Although I was not allowed by the Department, I'd tried to invite
                    the Chinese Ambassador to my residence, unless he invited me to his, which he
                    didn't, so we never did.</p>
                <p>Then on our way back, I was taken to his native village where Macias had set up a
                    brand new hospital but it had no patients in it, nor electricity, it had no
                    water. When we were in the President's village, where we spent the night, they
                    tried to put me and Mithoefer into different houses and we insisted that they
                    couldn't do that. We were already getting suspicious because there were all
                    sorts of crowds on our route.</p>
                <p>As I say, I describe this systematically and fairly amusingly, everybody agreed
                    with the conclusion that he was trying to set up a diplomatic incident which
                    they could then exploit because it was total backwater. He was trying to get
                    back in and he had this terrible internal human rights record.</p>
                <p>Speaking of the Chinese, this is also an incidental story, our sons were then 14
                    and 12. The younger one spent the first year with us and attended the American
                    International School in Yaounde, and the older one was boarding in St. Albans
                    here and came back for holidays including summers. The younger one was coming
                    back by himself and on a flight from Paris to Douala, he found himself sitting
                    next to 2 men dressed like Chinese functionaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mao suits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: One of them was studying a dictionary. He got into a conversation with the
                    one sitting next to him and he said, “My father is the American Ambassador to
                    Cameroon.” They said they were going to Cameroon as development assistants or
                    else diplomats. And so Alexander, who was 13 maybe, got into a very good
                    conversation with him defending US-China policy, US foreign policy in general.
                    He's now a lawyer who, in his first year out of Georgetown Law School, earned
                    more money than I earned cumulatively in 11 years after I got my Ph.D., not
                    adjusted for inflation....</p>
                <p>When he came back, I actually sent a cable on that. You know they use all sorts
                    of abbreviations in the State Department, which Secretary Vance I think tried to
                    eliminate, the heading was: AMSON's conversation with CHIDIPS - Chinese
                    diplomats.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>A week later, this is Christmas actually, there was a farewell diplomatic party
                    at the airport for a departing Ambassador, which the Chinese Ambassador
                    attended. My wife, Betsy—now in the Human Rights bureau of the Department after
                    serving in Oslo, Johannesburg and Reykjavik, in reverse chronological,
                    order—approached the Chinese Ambassador and said, “My son had a wonderful
                    conversation,” she can do this very well, “with two of your diplomats on the
                    flight from Paris to Douala last week. He just thought they were so friendly in
                    talking...” The Chinese Ambassador, who spoke no language known to man, through
                    his interpreter said, “No, no such diplomats. Never happened.” Which just
                    illustrates the larger point that one's family, if you're lucky, do an important
                    part of the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh they do, absolutely, no doubt about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You left there right after the elections?</p>
                <p>SPIRO: As I say, it's the first of many major mistakes, Jimmy Carter accepted my
                    routinely rendered resignation. We left the end of May of 1977, the President of
                    Cameroon gave a very nice farewell luncheon for me.</p>
                <p>When I'd come back from consultations, real consultations, in October of '76
                    during the campaign here, I called upon him after my return and he was very much
                    interested in the elections. He listened to the Voice of America, French
                    version, everyday. He said he thought that Carter would win. I said, I thought
                    Ford would win, he said Carter, and I said Ford. He said, “You want to bet?”
                    This is in French.</p>
                <p>I said American officials are not permitted to bet. He said, not to worry, he
                    wasn't permitted to bet either but didn't I want to bet? I said, all right. He
                    said, champagne? I said, all right. I thought he bet a bottle of champagne. Of
                    course he bet a case of champagne.</p>
                <p>The British Ambassador, who was a short fellow, known as Bertie, looked like a
                    caricature of a British diplomat of the 19th century. Because at formal
                    occasions when we wear striped pants and tails, he wore fore and aft sort of
                    hat</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: fore and aft, yeah</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: and saber</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole diplomatic uniform.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SPIRO: Right. He told me, I don't think it was true, that Cameroon imported more
                    champagne than the sum total of British development assistance, which he said
                    was $300,000 or pounds. But I don't think that was true.</p>
                <p>So President Ahidjo said a case of champagne. I said, all right, and we shook
                    hands on it. I reported this conscientiously to the Department and said if
                    President Ford wins, I would get a case of real French champagne because that's
                    what he serves. He doesn't drink himself. What he doesn't know is that if
                    Governor Carter wins, he would get a case of upstate New York Regency champagne
                    which we could get at Burkas (on Wisconsin Avenue NW), then, for $3 a bottle.
                    You know that Carter won and I ordered a case of Regency champagne from Burkas
                    and had it sent to him.</p>
                <p>The day before our departure, the President gave a luncheon in my honor, at which
                    he awarded me Legion of Valor (for which I had previously gotten permission from
                    Washington). Champagne was served, but the bottles were in napkins at this
                    farewell luncheon, and I asked him if this was the champagne he won from me,
                    because I wanted to make sure that he had received it. He said no, he was saving
                    that for my return. Which is one of the nicest things, quite touching...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left then and went back to the academic world, is that
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: No not immediately. First I was unemployed.</p>
                <p>From December '77 until March of '79, I was a Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson
                    International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian. The work I did there was
                    this long manuscript, of which I'd used shorter versions in things that have
                    been published, that manuscript has not been published, of my theory of
                    replication which was started by this labor experience.</p>
                <p>Then from '79 to '80 I was a visiting professor of government at the Defense
                    Intelligence School in Anacostia of which, incidentally, my old colleague,
                    Robert Neumann [former Ambassador to Morocco and Afghanistan, was a trustee on
                    the Visiting Committee. The Defense Intelligence School prepares mainly Defense
                    Attach�s before they go overseas, but they also have a year long course for
                    junior officers going up to field grade, where I gave a course of lectures on
                    the American people's attitude towards intelligence organizations through our
                    history.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>From 1980 until '89, I was the University Professor for American politics at the
                    John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies of the Free University of
                    Berlin, an integral, interdisciplinary institute of the Free University of
                    (West) Berlin. And since German universities are on vacation half the year, and
                    they don't work very hard the other half, and in Berlin I was entitled to a
                    sabbatical leave after every five teaching semesters, I'd spend more than half
                    my time in this country, mainly in Austin, Texas starting in 1982.</p>
                <p>In Berlin, I gave the introductory course on American Politics and Government, I
                    taught courses on the Congress, on American foreign relations, on the
                    Constitution. One graduate seminar comparing Presidents Nixon and Johnson, which
                    is particularly interesting today just after Nixon's death. I retired from
                    Berlin in 1989. In between I spent one term in 1983 as a visiting Professor of
                    Government at Harvard, and half a semester in '84 as a visiting Professor at
                    Tufts.</p>
                <p>In '82 I was invited by one of the Soviet diplomats in East Berlin to visit
                    Moscow. Herbert Okun, who was an old friend of mine from the State
                    Department,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came into the Foreign Service with Herb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: started as Ambassador to the GDR, in East Berlin, at the same time that I
                    started as a professor at the university in West Berlin. As a matter of fact, my
                    oldest son Peter and I were walking in East Berlin, and we saw these limousines
                    coming up, and there I happened to see Herb Okun, who was about to present his
                    credentials.</p>
                <p>Then I sent Herb a letter, which was a parody of the letters that you send to the
                    other Ambassadors in countries like Cameroon, when you have presented your
                    credentials: Your Excellency, I wish to inform you that I have this day
                    presented my letters of credence and at the same time the letters of recall for
                    my predecessor, the Honorable C. Robert Moore and blah, blah, blah. You conclude
                    by saying: And I hope and trust that the excellent relations that prevail
                    between our two countries, as well as between our two Embassies, as well as on
                    the institutional and personal levels, will continue, and I remain with
                    assurances of my highest regard etc., etc. Then I ended my parody to Herb Okun
                    by writing, “No shit.” He called me. We spent a lot of time together.</p>
                <p>In '81 '82, US-Soviet relations were at their nadir, as the First Secretary of
                    the Soviet embassy in East Berlin, to whom Herb Okun had introduced me, told me.
                    They therefore invited me to come as a guest of the USA and Canada Institute,
                    the Arbatov Institute, to Moscow, which I did in April of '82. The reason they
                    knew about me was not only that Herb Okun had introduced me to Bogomolov, but I
                    had visited our Embassy in Moscow twice, once in April '73 and once in
                    September-October 1974—did you know Joe Neubert?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SPIRO: He was then the Consul General in Leningrad, he'd been Senior Deputy of
                    the Planning Staff when I was on it.</p>
                <p>I had visited the Moscow twice under U.S. Embassy auspices. The first time I was
                    invited to their Foreign Ministry Planning Staff, which had never happened to
                    any U.S. official before. They took, this is what I referred to earlier, they
                    took the Annual Reports on the “State of the World” of the Secretary and of
                    President Nixon much more seriously than anybody in this country.</p>
                <p>When I met with their Planning Staff the first time in '73, they said, what about
                    the Nixon doctrine? I said, well, it's US policy. They said, but Zbig Brzezinski
                    just had an article in Foreign Affairs. And I said, “Brzezinski! Shit!” That
                    closed it then I apologized. Then they said, “But Foreign Affairs is published
                    by the Council on Foreign Relations and what they say really goes.”</p>
                <p>I always benefitted from the fact that unlike Kissinger, this is really coming to
                    the close of the circle, Kissinger wrote his senior honors thesis, on philosophy
                    of history. It was 400 pages long and led to the introduction of a top limit of
                    100 pages. I wrote mine under the same tutor, William Yandell Elliott, on the
                    Marxian critique of democracy, Marx and Engel's critique of 19th century
                    democracy, 153 pages, also too long but very good. We both graduated summa cum
                    laude.</p>
                <p>That thesis always helped me. Like the devil quoting scriptures, one of the
                    communists once said. In dealing with these communists, who didn't know beans
                    about Marx, they didn't know much about anything else either but certainly
                    didn't know about Marx. I'd given one lecture at the Institute of USA and Canada
                    affairs, so they knew me and they invited me and I came back as their guest.</p>
                <p>I got completely paranoid in Moscow because they kept me sort of isolated, every
                    once in a while I got out and Warren Zimmermann was Charg� and he gave a lunch
                    for me. Arthur Hartman, by this time Ambassador to Moscow, had come back from
                    consultations on my next to the last day, and I visited him and I told him how
                    paranoid I'd gotten because they were trying to do things to me. At the end they
                    tried to keep me there for longer than I'd planned by pretending that my return
                    reservation hadn't been confirmed, and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I said to Arthur, yesterday I met with a younger member of the Institute, and I
                    was about to give the name. And he said, no names please, pointing to where he
                    assumed the microphone bug was still hidden. Then I said, the main problem is
                    that my escort officer is, I've forgotten that name but I gave the name. He
                    said, clear case of KGB. I said, he speaks perfect English. He said, I know,
                    he's applied for a visa several times, we'll never give him a visa because he's
                    KGB.</p>
                <p>The next day I was taken for my farewell luncheon at the best Georgian restaurant
                    in Moscow by the control officer and a Deputy Director of the Institute. They
                    launched into an attack on Warren and on Arthur which I think was meant to sound
                    as though they had indeed been listening to our conversation. I was a
                    combination for them of a professor and an Ambassador. They thought that
                    ex-Ambassadors were like serving Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>They insisted on taking me to Leningrad where I'd been before with Joe Neubert.
                    Joe by this time was the local representative for the American-Soviet trade
                    council. He was in Moscow. They said, we want to take you to Leningrad to meet
                    with our branch of the Institute there. I said, I'd been there. They insisted
                    and I went with the Control Officer on the night train. I was really worried
                    that they were trying to do all sorts of things to me, but they didn't. We were
                    picked up by an officer of the Institute at the station in Leningrad and taken
                    for a ride out to one of the museums - I got sick and tired of visiting museums
                    and different palaces.</p>
                <p>They said, you've been an intelligence officer. (according to Who's Who, I was in
                    military intelligence during World War II.) I said, yes. They proceeded to ask
                    some questions. I said, well I was in military intelligence during the war when
                    I was 20. In my country, when you're out as an ambassador, you're out. When
                    you're out as president, you're out. Nixon wasn't all that out, that was his
                    doing.</p>
                <p>They said, in our country, once you are in military intelligence, you are always
                    in intelligence. I said, well in my country it's actually very different from
                    that. I don't know what they were trying.</p>
                <p>So I started in military intelligence because I spoke German and I end up at
                    Georgetown University fifty years later talking to your tape.</p>
