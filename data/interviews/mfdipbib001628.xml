                <p>Interviewed by: G. Lewis Schmidt</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Lew Schmidt interviewing Ambassador Al Puhan at
                        his home in Sarasota, Florida. Al, I wanted to ask you to start off by
                        giving us a brief biosketch of your background, where you came from, what
                        your education is or was and how it was that you first got started in the
                        information program. If you had any work experience prior to becoming
                        involved in the information program, you might cover that briefly before you
                        get to that phase of the discussion. So I'll stop now and you can take it
                        from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Biosketch, Education and Pre-Government Experience</p>
                <p>PUHAN: Okay, Lew. Well, I was born on march 7, 1913 in Germany in the borderland
                    between East and West Prussia, the city of Marianburg which is now Malbork in
                    Poland. My father had American citizenship and we cameI was brought over to this
                    country as a child. I went to schools, junior high and high school in Illinois,
                    Sandwich, Illinois; AB from Oberlin College in 1935; a Taft teaching fellowship
                    and Master's Degree from the University of Cincinnati; and then went to Columbia
                    to work for a Ph.D., the idea being that I would be a teacher, academician. I
                    completed all my course work for the Ph.D. at Columbia. The thesis on which I
                    was working was interrupted by World War II and by the information program which
                    I joined.</p>
                <p>I had no previous experience in radio or journalism for that matter. All my
                    experience was academic. I had done some teaching at Rutgers and Barnard and
                    Columbia. I suppose that my entry into the Voice of America was almost
                    accidental.</p>
                <p>1942: Employed By VOA, Broadcasting To Germany;Later Incorporated Into OWI</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Before World War II or before we entered the war, I think most of us who were in
                    the academic field were asked to sign some sort of a questionnaire asking what
                    particular qualifications we had that might be of use in case we were in the war
                    and I had put down that I knew German and French. I received a telegram at
                    Rutgers in New Brunswick, NJ from something called, I think at the time,
                    Coordinator of Information or some such name and asked to come to New York. This
                    was in May of 1942.</p>
                <p>I went there and that evening was an announcer in the German language over the
                    facilities of the BBC. I had to ask what the BBC was and when told that it was
                    the British Broadcasting Corporation I asked what it was doing in New York. I
                    was told that the Voice of America, which this was, was in its infancy, still
                    had no facilities of its own and was using the BBC facilities.</p>
                <p>I moved rather rapidly from announcer to producer to scriptwriter and
                    producer/scriptwriter and spent the next 11 years at the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go overseas at anytime? I presume this ultimately
                        merged into the OWI, Office of War Information. Did you take any overseas
                        assignment in the Voice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, my first check was paid by something called Short-Wave Research, Inc.
                    which I believe was part of Wild Bill Donovan's operation, OSS. This was to
                    become shortly thereafter the Office of War Information with headquarters in New
                    York City.</p>
                <p>1944: Assigned To Head German Language BroadcastingFrom American Broadcasting
                    Station In Europe (ABSIE)</p>
                <p>Yes, I went overseas in 1944 to head the German language broadcast at the
                    American Broadcasting Station in Europe, the acronym is ABSIE, and spent most of
                    1944 there. This was during WWIIthe Blitz was over of course, but the V-1's had
                    just begun, were just beginning while I was over there. I had a brief respite at
                    home at Christmas time '44 and then went overseas again in February or March of
                    1945, first to London and then to head German Broadcasting from Radio Luxembourg
                    which, as you probably know, was to become the sort of forerunner of the German
                    post-World War II network.</p>
                <p>Vehicular Accident Derails Prospective AssignmentAs Head Of New German Radio
                    Network</p>
                <p>I stayed there until September. In September of 1944 I accompanied three other
                    officers in a jeep. We went to Frankfurt to look into the setting up of
                    Frankfurt as the headquarters of the German network. And I suppose I was
                    destined to become the head of the new German radio network under Allied, under
                    American control.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>A vehicle accident, automobile accident, in the Hunsrueck Mountains of GermanyI
                    was sitting in the passenger seat next to the driver, two captains in the back
                    seat and a jeep coming from the opposite direction containing a chaplain got off
                    the side of the road and swung back too quickly and we smashed it head on. We
                    weren't going very fast, 35 miles an hour. Otherwise, I suppose I'd have been
                    killed. The three others were all thrown out. I was in the jeep, went down an
                    embankment and fractured by hip. I was taken to the 97th General Hospital in
                    Badnauheim in Germany where I spent the next three months recuperating. That
                    ended my career as the head of broadcasting or future chief of broadcasting of
                    German stations.</p>
                <p>Main Objective(s) Of Broadcasts From London and Luxembourg</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask you a few questions now about the earlier
                        part of your broadcasting experience. The first question I would like to ask
                        is exactly what did you look upon as your objective? What was it you were
                        trying to attain? Were you talking to the German troops? Or were you trying
                        to get to the German populace and influence their thinking and activity?
                        What was your main purpose in your broadcasting, from Luxembourg for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well Lew, let's go back just a bit. You know the objective, of course, of
                    the information program, the Office of War Information under Elmer Davis and
                    Robert Sherwood overseas was to seek the defeat of the Germans.</p>
                <p>When we went to London the idea here was, I suppose, to show the Germans that the
                    Voice of Americanot only troops there in England, but the Voice of America had
                    moved closer to the mainland. We were not a black station, like Soldatensender,
                    for example, which was a black station. Our objective here was to broadcast the
                    news of the advancing of the Allied troops and German defeats or occasional
                    German victories. In Luxembourg it soon became a matter of broadcasting to a
                    defeated nation. So in neither case was this specifically aimed at German
                    troops.</p>
                <p>Now, I might add, in addition to news and editorial and so on, we also broadcast
                    the music of Glen Miller. I was the man who taught Glen Miller enough German so
                    he could say a few words before playing a number. My secretary was the Mistress
                    of Ceremonies. These appealed, of course, to the young people, soldiers and
                    younger women and so on. So in that sense we were broadcasting to the troops.
                    But that was not generally the goal. The general goal was to address the Germans
                    as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On a more personal basis, when you made this trip into
                        Frankfurt and perhaps around Frankfurt, did by any chance you have a man by
                        the name of Ed Schechter with you in that group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, I know Ed Schechter very well, but he was not in that group, no. I
                    knew him somewhat later than that, but he was not in that particular group. He
                    was not at Radio Luxembourg to the best of my recollection, at least not while I
                    was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he did go to Radio Luxembourg. Whether he was there
                        at the same time that you were or not I don't know. But he went to London in
                        1944 and then was moved forward when the Allied armies moved into Europe and
                        began fighting their way into Germany. He did make a trip which later took
                        him down to Frankfurt and then into Austria which was his native area. So I
                        thought he might have been there when you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, no. I have no recollection of Ed Schechter at that point in time. As
                    I say I know Ed very well and we've exchanged Christmas cards and so on, and I
                    have no doubtand it's possible that he was in Luxembourg. But you see we had a
                    colonel, an American Philadelphia lawyer incidentally, who was the head of the
                    station in Luxembourg and I was the civilian deputy to him.</p>
                <p>Now, the big guns were, well, Golo Mann, the son of the famous German writer
                    Thomas Mann, was our chief broadcaster. But I don't recall Ed Schechter at that
                    time, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So as you began broadcasting to the Germans as a defeated
                        nation, your music program, I suppose, was designed to soften the attitude
                        of the Germans for what would happen when you ultimately took over the
                        control of the country. You said that your career in the broadcasting area
                        terminated with your injury and your hospitalization. What did you do and
                        where did they send you immediately after you were released from the
                        hospital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, I spentthe accident took place early in September of 1944 and I was
                    not ZI'd (Z-I stood for Zone of the Interior), as they called it at the time,
                    sent home until December of 1944. I spent some time in limbo, you might say,
                    recuperating. I went out to Sandwich, Illinois, where I grew up, with my young
                    wife and we stayed there until I received a letter from Werner Michel who was
                    the Program Director and who had hired me originally, asking me to return and
                    rejoin the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>1945: While On Home Recuperation Leave In U.S.,Called By, And Goes To, VOA/New
                    York</p>
                <p>I was in the processyou see, in the meantime, in these early months of 1945 as
                    you know the war was winding to a closeof debating my future: whether I would go
                    back to the academic world or stay with the U.S. government. Werner Michel sort
                    of made that decision for me by asking me to come back. I had enjoyed my work,
                    so I went back in early '45 and joined the Voice of America again in New
                    York.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay in the States than for some time after that?
                        Or did you ultimately go back abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Except for a trip or two on missions like the study of the takeover of
                    HICOG by the State Department and the changing of this from a military to a
                    civilian operation, I remained in New York until I left the Voice of America in
                    1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general purpose of your study of the takeover
                        by HICOG from office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1949: Member Of Mission Studying Personnel Requirements For RIAS in Berlin</p>
                <p>PUHAN: I was a member of that mission. The idea was to see what would be required
                    in the way of civilian personnelthe war was overwhat was required to run, to
                    supervise, the German radio, the American information station, RIAS, in Berlin.
                    And I don't have too many recollections of that, but I remember we were over
                    there and looking into this. This was aboutwhat? 1949, I would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything to do with making the recommendation
                        as to how the HICOG information program would be structured? Was there any
                        part of your study which was involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Speaking of myself personally I don't know whatI can't remember what
                    contribution I made. I was a member of a delegation. It was headed by higher
                    ranking officials than I, but I was a fairly aggressive young officer and no
                    doubt I made some suggestions. But I don't remember what they were or whether
                    they were acted upon or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left VOA then did you leave the information side
                        of the program completely? Or did you stay on in other aspects of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, I stayed with the Voice of America until 1953. Now, in 1952, Foy
                    Kohler, a fine Foreign Service Officer and the last director before the
                    onslaught by McCarthy, Senator McCarthy, said to meI was at this point Program
                    Director, one of three jobs below the Director of the Voice of America: Program
                    Director; Technical, George Herrick; and Evaluations, Leo Loewenthal. So I had a
                    big operation. I had 900 people, hiring and firing, setting up desks like the
                    Russian desk and so on, the Persian desk. But I had reached a point where I
                    probably could not, well, most likelyI shouldn't say probably, most likely
                    couldn't go any further.</p>

                <p>1952: On VOA Director, Foy Rohler's Advice, Puhan Applies For And Is AcceptedInto
                    Foreign Service, The State Department</p>
                <p>Foy Kohler called me in one day. We had worked very closely together and he said
                    to me, have you given any thought to what you were going to do? And I said,
                    really I hadn't but I was aware of the fact that I should make some sort of a
                    decision as to my future. And he said, have you given any thought to joining the
                    Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>My initial reaction was rather negative, and this was due to the fact that in my
                    work at the Voice as Program Director I had made frequent trips to Washington to
                    consult the various desks in the State Department as to personnel or policies to
                    be followed and so on. I was always a littleI was depressed by the fact that I
                    saw Foreign Service Officers coming to New York looking for jobs. I thought that
                    this was a career service and that the career service would place these officers
                    and here they were being sent out on their own apparently and looking for some
                    sort of employment.</p>
                <p>So I was not too impressed with that. Moreover, I had been in a very active type
                    of operation and much of the Foreign Service it seemed to me from what I'd seen
                    of it was a rather passive or rather studious or quiet, contemplative operation.
                    Remember we didn't have Iran in those days or that type of thing. So I was not
                    entirely smitten with the idea that I should join the Foreign Service. But the
                    more I thought of itmy wife and I talked it over, and I decided, well, why not
                    try it?</p>
                <p>So I took the examinations. There was a program at that time called Section 517.
                    This was prior to the Wriston program. 517 was a very intelligent program. It
                    allowed a very small number of officers from other government offices to take
                    examinations for the Foreign Service and enter at an appropriate rank. The
                    Wriston program, as you know, sort of blanketed everybody in there and was a
                    disaster in many ways because a lot of the people who didn't want to join it
                    were like fish out of water once they were sent overseas.</p>
                <p>But Remains As VOA Program Director Until May, 1953</p>
                <p>So I did take my examinations in early 1952 and was shortly thereafter informed
                    that I was a Foreign Service Officer if I passed the security and medical
                    requirements, which I did. But there was no onward assignment. Foy Kohler in the
                    meantime had left and I remained at the Voice as Program Director until May, I
                    guess it was, 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been there then during some of the worst
                        days of the McCarthy problem. Did you have any experiences in that that you
                        wouldn't mind recounting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, I regret to say that I was there when this onslaught took place. As
                    you know, McCarthy undoubtedly was a product ofeverybody is a product of the
                    times. If you recall the consternation that we felt at the fact that the
                    Russians were not going to be our allies after 1945 or '461 think Jimmy Byrnes,
                    who was Secretary of State, made that famous speech in Stuttgart, Germany where
                    he pointed out the fact that they were not going to be our friends and we began
                    to work on building up a deterrent. In 1948 they threw out the coalition
                    governments in Eastern and Southeastern European countries and threw us out too,
                    the Allied commissions out of those countries and indeed it looked for a while
                    as though the threat to the West was real which led to the formation of NATO and
                    the development of the Federal Republic of Germany, and then the reaction on the
                    part of the Soviets forming the Warsaw Pact and the German Democratic Republic
                    communist state.</p>
                <p>The McCarthy Onslaught</p>
                <p>Now, McCarthy probably knew nothing about communism, but he was clever in seizing
                    the issue when there was fear, real fear, that we were all infiltrated by
                    communist agents. He took advantage of that situation. He had three aides whoor
                    at least three, more than that. But he had three at least who were very hot and
                    heavy on the trail of communists. The late and scarcely lamented Mr. Cohn,
                    Schine and Bobby Kennedy. We were unfortunate at the Voice of America at that
                    time because we had a very poor director, a man who came from the outside and
                    who one time told me and Ed Kretzman, who was the man in charge of policy
                    matters at the Voice, that he thought it would be better if he stayed out of all
                    of this because once the purge was over he would be clean, would have clean
                    hands and start with this organization cleansed of all its evils.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: You know, I can't remember. I think it was Poppele, but don't hold me to
                    that. I believe it was a man named Poppele. He came from the radio broadcasting
                    business. He knew nothing, I think, about international affairs and he left us
                    without a head. Indeed we ran the big staff meetings, policy meetings. It was
                    Kretzman and I basically who ran that. Now, McCarthy you know lashed out first
                    at the Voice of America. It looked like a target of opportunity because after
                    all it had all these foreigners there and foreigners were suspect, and he was
                    going to find a rich harvest of communists in the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>Now, let me go back just a bit. I think I'm probably the only man who found
                    communists in the Voice of America, two of them. One of them was a Pole and I
                    learned about this because I came across an article in a Polish newspaper signed
                    by him, a Polish newspaper printed in Poland, and the other one was a Bulgarian
                    who used to send his scripts to the Bulgarian Embassy or Legation in Washington.
                    I found out about this and I fired both of them. And both of them went to their
                    native lands where they presumably carried on their careers. This was more than
                    McCarthy ever did.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>“The Loval American Underground”</p>
                <p>Now, when McCarthy lashed out at the Voice of America, there developed a very
                    ugly atmosphere in the Voice. There was the so-called American underground,
                    patriotic American underground. This was a bunch of people who thought that
                    everybody who disagreed with them was a communist.</p>
                <p>Now, I with my upbringing in the middle west and a fairly conservative outlook
                    and not ever having been a member of any organization except the Modern Language
                    Association when I was a young teacher, thought I had very little to fear from
                    McCarthy. But one morning my wife received a telephone callwe were living in New
                    Jerseyfrom Bobby Kennedy asking me to report to the Waldorf Astoria, where to my
                    amazement when I arrived there, there was a man who was on my staff sitting
                    there guarding the files. And this man was Howard Hotchner. He apparently had
                    written down, jotted down, everything that I had ever said in staff meetings and
                    so on and he had madeI had no inkling that this man had any political ideas. He
                    was a stamp collector. He lived in the same little town that Gene Kern and I
                    lived in, and we often went to work together and came home together. And I never
                    suspected that Howard had anything to do with this.</p>
                <p>I went there and I was asked by Cohn and Schine and there was another one, I
                    can't remember. His name began with S. But anyway, I was asked if I knew
                    anything about communism. I said, indeed I did. I had in mind the fact that
                    there was a public affairs officer in London who had been asked this question
                    and who thought apparently that if he said he knew something about it that he
                    would be accused of communism. So, he said he didn't. The interrogator said how
                    can you be a public affairs officer when you don't know anything about
                    communism?</p>
                <p>So they grilled me and the worst aspectI did not feel myself threatened because I
                    had no, as I say, I had no fear of being labeled a communist or anything like
                    that. The worst aspect of this was that anything you said could be used in a way
                    to get at somebody else. For instance, the case of Mr. Reed and the information
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reed Harris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PUHAN: Reed Harris, Reed Harris. Now, I had opposed Reed Harris when he had
                    ordered a cut in broadcasting to Israel. I opposed it on the grounds that I
                    thought this was a poor decision. I didn't think that we should do this and I
                    rather vocally opposed it. Now, this would have put me on the side of the angels
                    as far as McCarthy was concerned, but I pointed out that it had nothing to do
                    with Reed Harris' political views. I assumed it was a budgetary matter and that
                    it was a decision to be reached in Washington and I said I had a right to oppose
                    it and I opposed it. But this is the way it went, you see. That's why I say it
                    was a miasma. It was one of the most dismal periods in my life. Time and again I
                    had to defendnow, Robert Bauer was a good friend of mine. I had worked with him
                    since 1942. I knew he had been supported by Otto von Habsburg when he first came
                    to this country. I knew he was no communist. Indeed, all of his actions at the
                    Voice were consonant with mine. I learned that he made a good presentation
                    before the Committee.</p>
                <p>But the net result of all of this was that I was invited to Washington. I was not
                    invited to appear on television the way some of the others were. I went to
                    Washington and there was the full committee with McCarthy presiding and
                    Fulbright andwho was the Arkansas man?McClellan, Mundt and the whole committee
                    was there.</p>
                <p>And there I found rather strong support from Senator Mundt, a conservative as you
                    know from South Dakota, I believe. And he turned the whole thing around and
                    asked me for some suggestions. He said, do you think the Voice of America should
                    continue? Yes. Do you think that it should be moved from New York to Washington?
                    Well, I said, that's a debatable subject. I can see how there would be certain
                    advantages. In fact, I wrote him a long ten page memorandum on this subject. And
                    that to all intents and purposes ended the pursuit of McCarthy as far as I was
                    concerned, because the other Senators did not see it, I mean, they saw it the
                    way it was. But it left a rather very unhappy recollection. One felt soiled by
                    the whole thing. And indeed I felt so badly about it that I went to see Ed
                    Murrow at CBS.</p>
                <p>Now, I had met Ed Murrow in London in '44. He had had me on his “This is London
                    Calling” show a couple of times. And I had seen him off and on socially. So I
                    went to see him and I asked him if I could get a job at CBS and he said, sure.
                    I'll give you a job. And I said, what would that be? He said, well, it would be
                    in television. I said, oh, I haven't the faintest idea what television is all
                    about. He said, neither does anybody else. But, he added, we need some people
                    with ideas.</p>
                <p>1953: Last Minute Foreign Service Assignment To Vienna Aborts OfferFrom Ed Murrow

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Well, if it hadn't been for the fact that the very next day while I was still
                    contemplating Murrow's offer, I received my first Foreign Service assignment, to
                    Vienna, Austria. Now, it had never occurred to me that Vienna might be a post I
                    could get. But here I was a German language expert. I spoke German fluently. And
                    the idea of going to Vienna in the '50s under Four Power occupationmy wife and I
                    discussed this and a decision was made and that was the end of my tie with the
                    Voice of America and the information program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go on to discuss what you did there, was Howard
                        Hotchner a member of the so-called loyal American underground of which there
                        were about a dozen or 14, I think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: I don't know that. I was never quite sure who was and who wasn't. I
                    suspected a number of them. Howard Hotchner was certainly involved with that
                    group of people. But whether he was in that I just don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you didn't have any further difficulties
                        yourself with McCarthy, but did you have any experiences with the people who
                        were serving with you and whom you were supervising being caught up in that
                        web?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, I knew a good many of the people who were caught in that web. Bauer
                    was one. I think I managed to save him in Washington, DC. I knew, of course, the
                    head of the English news section was. I can't remember his name now. It's so
                    many years ago. Well, yes, there was one more thing that happened. I went
                    overseas as a Foreign Service Officer. When I got to Vienna, I was told that my
                    commission was being held up as was Bill Tyler's and as were a number of others
                    who had come in under Section 517, because of the McCarthy allegations and
                    charges. It wasn't until 1953no, it wasn't until about 1954 or 1955 that we
                    finally were confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a somewhat similar experience with it. This is not
                        my interview, but because of that, I can understand what you went through.
                        When you went to Austria, in precisely what capacity did you go? What was
                        your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In Vienna, Assigned As Secretary To Allied Commission For Austria</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>PUHAN: It was an assignment that was not particularly sought after by Foreign
                    Service Officers. You see, Lew, the problem I think ever since lateral entry
                    into the Foreign Service came into being, the problem has always been: what do
                    you do with a man who has had 900 people working for him as in my case? Where do
                    you put him, what kind of a job? Yet, he's had no foreign experience except with
                    the Voice of America and he hasn't been a political reporter in the sense in
                    which the Foreign Service use that or an economic officer. So what do you do
                    with them? And I think they've always had a lot of difficulty. And I was
                    assigned to what I thought was probably a sort of an ancillary job which most
                    Foreign Service Officers didn't want. It was held at the time by Hal Ekern. It
                    was U.S. Secretary in the Allied Commission for Austria.</p>
                <p>Now, the Allied Commission for Austria, as you know, was in its eighth year when
                    I got there. Two more years were to pass before finally the Austrian State
                    Treaty was hammered out. Hal Ekern, I think he clung with his fingernails to
                    that job because he came out of the military and eventually entered the Foreign
                    Service through the Wriston program. But my coming sort of endangered his job
                    for a while there. He went to the Political Section of the Embassy. I wasn't
                    even housed in the Embassy. I was in the Allied Commission Building and the
                    biggest drawback was that I really couldn't have any contact with the Austrians.
                    I enjoyed it. I enjoyed working with the Soviet, British and French
                    Secretaries.</p>
                <p>And most important of all, it brought me into weekly contact with one of the
                    finest ambassadors the United States ever had, namely Llewellyn E. Thompson.
                    Thompson was a man who did not ask what was your background in the Foreign
                    Service or what did you do? He was interested in people who could help himand he
                    found me very useful because he found out that I spoke German fluently. So I
                    began to go with him on his calls to see the chancellor or the vice chancellor
                    of Austria. And, of course, I always briefed him before the Allied Commission
                    meeting. So this was a big plus for me. But as I say it was not a job which made
                    use of my talents as a German language officer because I had no contact with the
                    Austrians except when I went as interpreter, as reporter with theambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is just an aside, but going back briefly at what age
                        did you come to the United States? And then I have a follow-up
                        question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Okay, I was twelve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were twelve. Presumably at that time you spoke German
                        more as a juvenile than you did an adult German. At what point did you feel
                        your German developed into a more adult capability?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, that's a good question. You're quite right. When I went to Oberlin
                    one of the electives was a language course. Of course I signed up for German.
                    The instructor told me after the first lesson to stop in and see him and he
                    asked me where I had learned my German and told him my background. So he said,
                    well, you don't belong in German I. He moved me up to more advanced courses.
                    Indeed, I became a German major. This was more or less a promise by the head of
                    the German Department that he would get me a job upon graduation, a teaching
                    fellowship when I graduated. Remember that was the time when we sold apples
                    after you graduated from college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I also became a teaching fellow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yeah. Well, so I accepted that. Of course, it improved since I worked with
                    German all throughout my college career. Working for the master's degree,
                    reading German newspapers, reading literally the entire German literature, and I
                    developed my German. Naturally in Austria it was polished because there I read
                    the Austrian newspapers and eventually got in a position where I was able to act
                    even as interpreter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like you to make a few comments about what you think
                        the mission accomplished in the years that you were there and do you think
                        that you personally contributed something to those accomplishments? If so,
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, the Allied Commission was in its last two years beginning its ninth
                    year when I arrived there in June of 1953. It had been a very useful
                    organization in that there was an article in the document which set up the
                    Allied Commission which allowed Austria laws to become law even if there was one
                    veto. It could not stop them from becoming law. It was sort of a shield behind
                    which the Austrians could run their own country even though the four powers all
                    had troops there in Austria.</p>
                <p>When I arrived there the Allied Commission was marking time. There had been, oh,
                    300 or more meetings to try and get an Austrian state treaty and they had always
                    broken down. It wasn't until its tenth year that we received a signal that the
                    Russians were prepared to go for a treaty provided Austria would accept
                    neutrality and pay certain reparations.</p>
                <p>I learned a great deal about the Russians for one thing. I dealt very closely
                    with the Russian Secretary, but not only with him but also with the top Russians
                    in the Allied Commission because after every meeting we had a social reception,
                    cocktail party if you like, and we showed movies to each other. I even took
                    Russian language lessons at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Well, my contribution to itI don't want to exaggerate that. I think I probably
                    helped Ambassador Thompson, and even more so after he asked me to become his
                    political counselor there, because I was able to keep him abreast of what the
                    Austrians were saying and planning. The biggest accomplishment was, of course,
                    under the Allied Commission, the final hammering out of the treaty. As you
                    knowyou probably have heard from others, how this process worked. In the morning
                    the American Ambassador or High Commissioner, as the British and the French also
                    were called, would meet at our Embassy and we'd have a strategy session. Then in
                    the afternoon we'd meet with the Russians. This is where Ambassador Thompson
                    showed his great skill. When he saw that the Russian was unable to move
                    obviously because his position was hard and he couldn't move beyond it, Thompson
                    would suggest that we have a closed session with only two people from each of
                    the four elements there. This gave the Russian a chance to select whomever he
                    wanted to select from his element and you could find out what was the sticking
                    point.</p>
                <p>I learned personally more than I undoubtedly contributed because I watched at
                    close range, worked with Ambassador Thompson on this. He came to accept me sort
                    of as his aide and eventually even though I was not the number two man, I was to
                    all intents and purposes, the last two years I was there, I was the DCM, Deputy
                    Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>1955: The Achievement Of The Austrian State Treaty</p>
                <p>But the great accomplishmentthe Austrian State Treaty of 1955I think was still
                    one of the finer bits of diplomacy since the end of World War II, because it got
                    the Russians out of a part of the world that they had occupied, the little bit
                    of Eastern Austria, something they haven't done again until Afghanistan recently
                    where they finally had to pull out. And, of course, even more recently, out of
                    Eastern Europe and East Germany. So I really think that that was a great
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <p>Now it was Thompson I believe largely, Ambassador Thompson, to whom the credit
                    goes for achieving that treaty. As you probably know he had also been
                    instrumental in the Trieste settlement, although Clare Booth Luce took credit
                    for that.</p>
                <p>Theories As To Why USSR Allowed The Austrian State Treaty</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What in your estimation caused the Soviets to soften their
                        attitude and come around to a decision that maybe it was better for them to
                        get out of Austria if they could get the kind of neutrality they were
                        looking for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PUHAN: This is the question of course that has been asked many times and only the
                    Soviets know what the reason was. All kinds of theories have been advanced. The
                    most likely one was that after ten years they had not been able to communize
                    Eastern Austria. This was largely due to the work of that energetic Socialist
                    Minister of Interior Oskar Helmer who prevented the police from beingprevented
                    the Russians from infiltrating the police in Eastern Austria. While the Russians
                    had troops, of course, in Vienna and in Eastern Austria we also were there in
                    Vienna and Salzburg. And as you know that salient stuck right into what became
                    the Soviet Empire, that is Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</p>
                <p>Another theory is that they decided, well, if we move out they'll have to move
                    out too and that leaves Austria without the Americans, British, and French
                    there.</p>
                <p>There's also the theory, as you probably heard, that they were considering the
                    idea of a neutral Germany and that the idea of Austria accepting neutrality
                    might become a model for Germany. I tend to put less credence in that theory
                    because the Russians probably knew and know today that a neutral Germany is sort
                    of out of the question. It's not really feasible. Now, it's possible for Austria
                    to be neutral. In fact, Austria profits from that, but I doubt if they would
                    have thought that that would also work for Germany.</p>
                <p>One more thing. You know that their interpretation of neutrality was somewhat
                    different than oursneutral for us and against the other side. As it turned out
                    they've learned the Austrians ideologically have always been on our side, but
                    they have been very careful, like Finland, not to antagonize the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>So I think probably more likely than not the idea of getting us out of there,
                    getting that salient out of the Soviet commonwealth there, was probably the
                    dominant factor in accomplishing this. I might just say in 1980 the Austrian
                    government invited me and my wife to come to Vienna to help them celebrate the
                    25th anniversary of the Austrian state treaty. I was a little nonplussed that
                    they picked me and I asked why I was selected. There were other people who had
                    higher rank than I did there. Thompson of course was dead but Jim Penefield is
                    still very much around. And I was told that, well, when the academicians in
                    Austria studied the files, the American files made available to them dealing
                    with the making of the Austrian state treaty, they found my name repeatedly on
                    cables. Well, that was because I was the drafting officer and of course the
                    ambassador signed the cable.</p>
                <p>So they decided that I was sort of a man who was on the inside, had the inside
                    track. And in the discussions that followed with the Russians and British and
                    French with Austrians... [End of Tape 1, Side 1]</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Yes, as I was saying, the Russians gave nothis is 1980 now, 25 years after the
                    treatygave no indication, no clear indication as to what motivated them. This is
                    the pre-Gorbachev era and so there was no Glasnost at that time. They made all
                    kinds of protestations that they were always for this treaty but the Austrians
                    and we had not complied with what we should have and so on. That was their
                    answer at that time. So there's no clear answer to that question as to what
                    motivated them to do it. But it remains to this day from my point of view an
                    excellent piece of diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that Tommy Thompson wanted you to be his

                        extensively with the Austrians outside the official Austrian government? Or
                        were you primarily dealing with the Austrian government officials? And if
                        you were dealing outside, with whom were you talking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Both. I had, of course, contact with, I knew and they knew me personallyI
                    knew Chancellor Julius Raab, the Vice Chancellor, Schaerf. I knew Oskar Helmer.
                    I knew Poldi Figl, Foreign Minister. I knew them all from the top on down. But I
                    had also a wide range of contact with Austrians outside of government. There
                    were the party people I dealt withmainly with the ChristianCDOthe Christian
                    Democratic people. That's probably the equivalent of our Republican Party,
                    whereas my colleague Alex Johnpoll dealt with the SPO, the Socialist Partythe
                    Socialist Party of Austria. I knew everybody from the Chairman of both
                    partiesthe equivalent of the Chairmen of the National Committees here. Then I
                    had a number of friends among the journalists, Fritz Molden, Oskar Pollock and a
                    number of others. I knew a good many of the theater people because I knew
                    German. We went to the opera once a week because you could go to the opera for
                    $4.00 a ticket and sit in the first two rows. And I attended the theater a lot.
                    I got to know the artists, doctors, lawyers as well as the Parliamentarians and
                    Municipal officials. The Mayor of Vienna was a good friend of mine. So I had a
                    lot of outside contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I ask that question because I had a feeling that perhaps
                        that also influenced the Austrian government in their giving you an

                <p>Evaluation Of USIA Effectiveness In Austria During Puhan's Period There</p>
                <p>Since you said that you had a number of contacts with the journalists there, do
                    you have any feelings or do you have any knowledge of what role the USIS played
                    in the Austrian program and in thewell, I don't suppose they influenced the
                    Russians any, but do you think that they were an effective element in the
                    program or don't you know or don't you think they were?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PUHAN: Yeah, I think they were. After all, they ran the Wiener Kurier, which was
                    the first newspaper in Austria under American auspices. Rot-Weiss-Rot, the
                    network, the radio network in Austria was supervised and controlled by USIA
                    operations. Although I didn't have as much to do with them in my Foreign Service
                    duties, I always knew who the responsible people were and what they did. Yes, I
                    think the answer to your question is: yes, I thought they did a very effective
                    job in the post-treaty signing or even pre-treaty signing days in Austria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a well-known fact, of course, that by the time Hitler
                        moved into Austria there was a very pro-Nazi feeling in a large segment of
                        the population among the Austrians. Did you determine to what extent there
                        was any residual of that feeling aftersay during the period you were there?
                        I ask this because it seems under certain circumstances to have resurfaced a
                        little bit in recent years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Absolutely not! I say this sarcastically. There were no Nazis when I was
                    there. I can still remember the first time I ever crossed into Austria and that
                    was into Innsbruck in 1945 when I was at Luxembourg. When you crossed the border
                    the Austrian flags were flying and everybody had been in the Austrian
                    underground, and there were no NAZIS! While we all knew the acclaim which Hitler
                    received when he entered Austriawhen was it? In 1938. The Austrians thought
                    Anschluss was the best solution for them. There was none of that in 1953 when I
                    got there. There was no antisemitic feeling although antisemitism had been
                    endemic in Austria going back into the 19th century. No, there was a complete
                    denial of that.</p>

                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, as usual I was assigned to Washington and to an office I had never
                    heard of, the Office of International Administration, OIA, in the Bureau of IO,
                    International Organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I was sent as deputy to Jack Fobes who was the Director of OIA. It was again one
                    of those jobs that was not sought after by Foreign Service Officers. In fact,
                    once again we were not in the main State building. We were over in a garage in
                    Rosslyn where the temperature in the wintertime was ten degrees colder on the
                    floor than it was on the top of your desk. But it had its interesting moments
                    because I learned a great deal about international organizations. I went with
                    the Surgeon General to the annual meeting of WHO (World Health Organization). I
                    went to Vienna, returned to Vienna when the IAEA, International Atomic Energy
                    Agency was formed with John McCone as head of the delegation. I went to a UNESCO
                    conference and I was frequently at the United Nations. But it was not my choice
                    of a job. When I complained to Francis Wilcox who was the very capable director
                    of the Bureau that I didn't have much to do, he removed Jack Fobes, made him his
                    aide and made me Director of the Office of International Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you became the Director of the Office, what were
                        your duties in the organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, I don't know. I think we had a staff of something between 15 and 20
                    people and essentially the duties of the director and the deputy directorI was
                    the deputy director until Jack Fobes moved into the front office up there with
                    Fran Wilcoxwas two-fold. One was to prepare the budget for U.S. participation in
                    the International Organizations, prepare the budget and assist the Assistant
                    Secretary for International Organizations in the presentation of the budget to
                    the Congress.</p>
                <p>The other one had to do with the selection of personnel although there we were
                    sort of handicapped at that time because it was still sort of thought that,
                    well, people who worked in the United Nations Secretariat were international
                    civil servants and they should not be vetted by us. As a result, of course, the
                    Russians were all part of the Russian element and were working for the Soviet
                    Union. And our people in the UN, our Americans there, often disagreed with
                    Administration policy. But we had a certain amount of say in trying to recruit
                    people to go into the Secretariat. So those were essentially the duties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any role whatsoever in the decisions and
                        determination of the policies that would be supported by the U.S. delegation
                        to the United Nations? Or was that all handled at a different level in a
                        different area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: It was handled by a sister office headed, I think later on by Joe Sisco
                    and probably alsolet's see, no Joe Sisco. I can't remember now but policy was
                    notno, we did not advise a delegation on what position to take on issues that
                    appeared before the security council or the general assembly. That was not our
                    purview.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the international organization area
                        and where did you go from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1959: Foy Kohler, Then Assistant Secretary, European Affairs,Brings Puhan Into
                    EUR As Executive Director</p>
                <p>PUHAN: I spent two years there. I was there from '57 towell, '57 and '58 or '59.
                    No, '57 to '59 and then I was rescued, as it were, by Foy Kohler who had become
                    Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and he called me up and asked
                    me to come and see him. He asked me if I would like to become Executive Director
                    of the European Bureau. Well, I jumped at the chance with alacrity and had two
                    years in a job that I liked very much because it called for administrative
                    experience. While I had basic political interests, I also liked the idea of
                    administering the European Bureau, which was then and is now a big bureau and a
                    very important one. Here again you had the budget for your bureau as well as
                    your embassies, all your embassies in Europe and I had a chance to visit
                    practically all of the embassies while I was there during the two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know how it was in the Department of State there.
                        I started out in the Department myself when I sort of by accident got into
                        the information side. And when the USIA was separated I elected to stay with
                        USIA. I found that in the Agency there was a great tendency I think to bring
                        the administrative side of the effort much more closely to the policy side
                        than I noticed at State, at least at the time when I was at State. State,
                        during the time I was there, which terminated at the end of 1956, displayed
                        a tendency to think that the administrative people were sort of a different
                        breed and not quite of the same caliber as the economic or political
                        officers. Thus, they were kept pretty far away from any substantive work in
                        the policy determination. Did you find that to be true in your role as the
                        Executive Director for the European Area? Or did you find that there you got
                        closer to the policy issues than you did in other assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Although State Tended To Consider Administration As Beneath Policy,Puhan Feels
                    His Administrative Experience Helped Him In Future Assignments</p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, your findings are quite correct. I think this has been a problem for
                    the Foreign Service. You know, they said either you were in substantive work or
                    you were in administrative work. As a result, jobs like executive director were
                    not sought after by Foreign Service people. Officers wanted to be Director of
                    the Office of German Affairs or Soviet Affairs or Western European Affairs or
                    whatever. This I think has hurt the Foreign Service in the past. Because as
                    embassies grew by leaps and bounds, ambassadors and DCMs were asked to head
                    staffs representing 30 or 40 organizations with very little administrative
                    experienceI think it hurt them.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Now, it didn't hurt me particularly because as I say I've always been a rather
                    aggressive officer. And when we had bureau staff meetings, much, I imagine, to
                    the chagrin of my colleagues in the so-called substantive field, I voiced my
                    opinions if the officer said something that I thought was rather out of line in
                    Western or Eastern Europe. I felt free to speak my mind. And I was not stopped
                    either by Foy Kohler or by Bill Tyler or finally by John Leddy. I mean, they
                    allowed me to do this. But as I say, it probably caused some heartburn among the
                    officers who thought I ought to stick to my budget and that sort of thing. So I
                    wasn't hurt by it at all. I rather enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think you were fortunate also in having had a
                        rather remarkable substantive experience not only by educational background
                        but also in Austria before and therefore you had credentials which could be
                        brought forth to supplement what you were trying to say and reinforce what
                        you were trying to give as an input from your position as the administrative
                        area officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, I would agree with that. I think that I hadI felt that I knew as much
                    about Central Europe as the substantive officers there did and felt I was well
                    qualified to voice my views. We had some very timid souls running offices there
                    at times and it sometimes seemed ludicrous to me, some of the things that were
                    discussed that when an Assistant Secretary was sitting there and bringing up
                    little things about somebody drowning in the Danube or something like that. And
                    I thought that I was qualified. But as I say I've never been one to shy away
                    from that sort of thing. While there were undoubtedly people who said, well,
                    this guy is never going to become an ambassador, I fooled them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever feel in subsequent assignments that being in
                        what was definitely recognized in the Department as being essentially
                        administrative had any adverse effect upon your future assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, I think once I became Executive Director of the European Bureau, you
                    see what happened; Ambassador Thompson told me in 1957 when I sort of complained
                    about this assignment, the Office of International Administration in the Bureau
                    of International Organizations. He said, Al, don't worry. You're going to go to
                    Washington and you will get known. That's all he said. I did not get known in
                    OIA, but I did get known as Executive Director of the European Bureau. And as a
                    result of this when my two years came up I was nominated to become DCM to George
                    Kennan in Belgrade. I was elated at the thought and I realized, of course, that
                    I was probably going toif he accepted methat I was going to work for one of the
                    finest diplomats we've produced. Foy Kohler or Bill Tyler sent me out to
                    Belgrade by using that as part of the inspection of our embassies to meet with
                    George Kennan. And we had about three days of talking. And I realized, of
                    course, I had no desire nor ability to advise this man on Soviet or Yugoslav
                    affairs, but that I could probably help him with running the embassy which was
                    gaining in strength, in numbers.</p>
                <p>1962: Expecting Assignment As DCM, Belgrade, Puhan Becomes DCM Bangkok</p>
                <p>So this was to be a substantive job. But to my astonishment when I got back I was
                    asked to go to Bangkok as DCM. The reason I think was that we had a political
                    ambassador there and they wanted someone to ride herd on him which is very
                    difficult for a DCM to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: t was Kenneth Young.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a pretty good ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Kenneth Young was a friend of Chester Bowles. He had some credentials for
                    being out there. His problem washe's dead now as you knowhis problem, I think,
                    was mainly that he sort of, well, I've never seen any ambassador call as many
                    press conferences as Kenneth Young. And during his press conferences he had his
                    small children climbing all over him with Thai journalists around. He never
                    could keep an appointment on time. I immediately voiced some objection to going
                    there when it was proposed to me by saying, well, I don't know anything about
                    the country and it's not my field. And I was told, well, that's all right. We
                    want you to take over there and Averell Harriman wants this done.</p>
                <p>Well, Kenneth Young was in Washington and I got an appointment with him. And the
                    first question he asked me was why do you want to go to Bangkok? And I said, I
                    don't. I said, I want to go to Belgrade where I know something about the area. I
                    don't know anything about Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you mean you never got to Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Never got to Belgrade, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, so this came up in lieu thereof.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: They just changed it after I had been told, yes, get ready. My wife had
                    even measured for curtains in Belgrade and the house. Anyway, I went to Kenneth
                    Young, who liked my frankness and I think was relieved that I was not an expert
                    on Southeast Asian affairs. We got along very well. And as you may remember, he
                    and his wife and my wife all had hepatitis at the same time and I was Charg�. He
                    never returned. His case was complicated by some gastrointestinal ailment and I
                    was Charg� for six, seven months in Bangkok. So you see after that, of course,
                    then came Director of the Office of German Affairs and then finally Ambassador
                    to Budapest. So by the time I finished my job as the Executive Director I was in
                    a substantive job, but known as a man who could also administer. I was sent out
                    by Katzenbach, for example, to implement both the BALPA (balance of payments
                    reduction program) and OPRED (overseas personnel reductions) programs. You
                    remember those cutbacks?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember those cutbacks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: I was sent out to do those because, I guess, of my administrative
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years was it that you were in Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: '62 to '64.</p>

                <p>PUHAN: No, there was not.</p>

                <p>PUHAN: Yes, Sarit was in power when I was there and died in bed while I was

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you think or what would you consider to have
                        been the principal political developments in Thailand during your period
                        there as far as the Thai government itself was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, as far as the Thai government was concerned I think the principal
                    development was already in progress when I got there. That, as you know, you
                    were there, Thailand had until World War II a policy of neutrality. All the
                    roads out of Thailand ended at the border and they had nothing to do with the
                    outside world. And they kept pitting France and Britain against each other. Then
                    when the Japanese came in there and were ousted they finally opted to go with
                    the Americans. When I was there the buildup for the subsequent war in Vietnam
                    was beginning. I knew General Harkens, Paul Harkens, who was the predecessor of
                    Westmoreland. And I knew Westmoreland. They used to come to Bangkok and sit in
                    my office. I used to have long conversations with them. That was the principal
                    development.</p>
                <p>I think one of the problems in Thailand was that the capital was full of talented
                    people, Thais, as you know, but none of these talented people wanted to go out
                    and work in the boondocks. So the communists agents could go in there and tell
                    the people that when we take over you won't see the tax collector, you see, and
                    this was a real danger that was developing in Thailand. But I think Thailand
                    having opted to ally itself with the United States caused some regrets later on
                    in Thailand.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Graham Martin come in as ambassador before you left?
                        Or had you left by the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: No, he came in. He came in after this long hiatus when I was Charg�. He
                    came in in the Fall of 1963 or maybe October, November. In any event, I spent
                    six or seven months with him.</p>
                <p>1964: Back To Washington As Head Of Office of German Affairs</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was still there when I came in. He was succeeded by
                        Leonard Unger. So from Bangkok then you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: From Bangkok I went back to the Department of State to head the Office of
                    German Affairs which I did for four years and then really five because the fifth
                    year John Leddy made me an Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say were the principal problems that you
                        faced at the time of your incumbency there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, first of all when I got there the Berlin Task Force which had been
                    formed in 1961I got there in 1964 in Washingtonthe Berlin Task Force had
                    virtually taken over the power that should belong to the Office of German
                    Affairs. By the time I got there in 1964 it was the tail that wagged the dog.
                    And I said to Bill Tyler, after looking at this, I said, I don't think this
                    makes any sense. You can't expect me to recommend policies for Germany if the
                    men and women in the Berlin Task Force who have nothing to do now since there
                    aren't many crises anymore are beginning to assume more and more of the powers
                    of the Office of German Affairs.</p>
                <p>Bob Creel, my predecessor, I think was most reluctant to do that job. I told him,
                    I said, I thought this ought to be our organization. In fact, the Berlin Task
                    Force was turned over to me. And after this I chaired the Berlin Task Force when
                    it met.</p>
                <p>Well, the problems of course were many. As you know, our policy towards Germany
                    has always been a very complicated one. On the one hand we were interested ever
                    since 1947, '48, in containing the Russians. This required in time a strong
                    Germany in NATO and the planting of nuclear weapons in Germany. It called for
                    subsidization of our troops by the Germans and by us too of course. And also
                    there was a conflict because Adenauer was interested in developing a close
                    relationship with de Gaulle and did. This, however, put the Germans in conflict
                    with us because, as you know, in the days of Lyndon B. Johnson, you couldn't
                    mention de Gaulle's name in his presence. And this caused a rather tricky
                    situation. Then the question of German reunification. Yes, we're for
                    reunification, but thought that it probably wouldn't take place.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>So it was a very complex situation, for me probably the most interesting of my
                    entire career. Because for one thing having the language and having the
                    knowledge of Germany and having the knowledge of their literature and their
                    background, I had access to anybody. I knew every chancellor from Adenauer
                    through Helmut Schmidt. And I was able to see them in Bonn. I was able to talk
                    to Theo Sommer, Editor of Die Zeit in Hamburg. I knew these people. I saw a
                    German delegation almost every week in my office. Their backs had to be stroked
                    or they had to be assured that what Mansfield was trying to do, reducing our
                    troops in Germany, wasn't going to happen. Of course, I had a big advantage over
                    my colleague who ran Soviet affairs. As you know, usually there has been a
                    senior, very senior officer on the seventh floor close to the Secretary who is a
                    Soviet expert. It was either Foy Kohler or George Kennan or Llewellyn Thompson,
                    or Chip Bohlen.</p>
                <p>In my case in German affairs there was no German expert between Dean Rusk and
                    myself. Dean Rusk frequently called me directly on the phone and asked me to
                    come up, especially on matters pertaining to Berlin or certain things that the
                    West Germans were contemplating doing, and to listen to his complaints
                    justifiedabout German failure to back us on Vietnam and that sort of thing. It
                    was a most challenging job and one that I thoroughly enjoyed. I worked hard, it
                    was a six day operation and sometimes even on Sunday. But it was a most
                    challenging job. The most challenging job in some ways I ever held even though
                    as ambassador, of course, you have certain prerogatives that you didn't have
                    there. But it was the most interesting job of my career I think.</p>
                <p>German/American Relations In This Period Were Turning A Bit Sour</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, what years are those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: 1964 to 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a period during which the opinion of the Germans
                        with regard to the United States began to turn around a bit and become sour,
                        wasn't it? What are your comments on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PUHAN: That is true and it was caused partly because of the fact that we were
                    bugging them constantly for more money. We had very little to offer them except
                    possible quick death with our nuclear weapons, our constant changes in policy
                    from massive retaliation to flexible response to whatever they were called at
                    the time, had them in a stew. At the same time the Wirtschaftswunder, the
                    miracle of their economic recovery made them a power to be reckoned with. Yet
                    Germany was a big economic body with a small political head. They had no say in
                    foreign affairs. They rather resented our asking them to do things which they
                    thought they had no business doing like backing them up on Vietnam and so on.
                    And so relations did sour. I had very good relations with the ambassador,
                    Heinrich Knappstein, and his brilliant political counselor, Berndt Von Staden,
                    who later on became ambassador to Washington and I think somehow maybe I helped
                    a little bit to keep American-German relations on an even course.</p>
                <p>And then our top people in State, as you well know, were preoccupied with
                    Vietnam. Germany could under the circumstances only be a nuisance. I think the
                    Germans felt this. And their leaders, Adenauer, Erhard, Kiesingerwere all fairly
                    submissive. Adenauer knew he was head of a defeated country, a divided country
                    and Erhard was a specialist in economics. When we got to Willy Brandt, you got a
                    different personality and a man who, as you know, when he became Chancellor was
                    the one who actually preceded Nixon in detente, I mean, in settling the Berlin
                    situation, settling it more or less.</p>
                <p>But, yes, it was a fascinating period. I saw Germany struggling from impotence,
                    total impotence, in the political international arena, to a role of some
                    significance, and of now much greater significance with an army of nearly
                    500,000 men and an economic structure that is not rivaled in Europe todaywith
                    the reunification of 80 million Germans in the offing. But in the '60s the
                    Germans became more assertive. I can remember walking with Helmut Schmidt from
                    the SheratonI don't know, one of the hotels downtown Washingtonto the Golden
                    Parrot for lunch and he was quite sarcastic about American policies and American
                    leaders. The Germans began to feel they were being used and they were not
                    allowed to play their proper role. So it was kind of a touchy situation.</p>
                <p>I was asked one time what do you do with these delegations? We had a delegation
                    of mayors this week, a delegation of Bundestag members the next week, a
                    delegation of journalists the following week. And one of my friends said, well,
                    what do you say to them when you have these sessions? I said, well, I welcome
                    them and then I listen. And that's what they wanted, someone to whom they could
                    sound off. And our peoplethere was a man who was very helpful to me in this
                    case. You see, Johnson was too busy. Rusk, too, was busy as was McNamara. But
                    Hubert HumphreyI could always count on Hubert Humphrey to meet a delegation of
                    Germans, to meet the Vice President of the United States. He was always very
                    jovial and of course patted them on the head and made them feel good when they
                    left the office. So he was a real help.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was also the period I think in which the real
                        radicalization of the German student group came into full flower wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Are you talking about the Greens?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Greens began moving into Berlin very extensively
                        and finally just virtually ruined their free university at Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes. This is the time when this began. Now, you know, radical movements,
                    of course, exist in every country. I got a lot of questions about that when I
                    was in Hungary. The Hungarians knew, of course, of my past as Director of the
                    Office of German Affairs. So I became sort of their unofficial consultant on
                    German affairs. And they were always concerned about radical movements in
                    Germany, both of the left and of the right. And I had to point out to them that,
                    look, you can't expect the country not to havein a free society you've got to
                    expect this. I always told them I thought it would remain rather small. I didn't
                    think they had to be too concerned. But this added a little spice to the whole
                    operation, yes.</p>
                <p>1969: America's Second Ambassador To Hungary</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then from your assignment as head of German desk, the
                        German country director, you went to Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, in 1969. In April or May of 1969 I was nominated to become ambassador
                    to Hungary. My predecessor there was the first ambassador to Hungary, Martin
                    Hillenbrand. He'd been there only about 16 months, I think, something like that.
                    And I was the second to go and remained there over four years. Fascinating
                    country, fascinating people and tremendous job.</p>
                <p>Henry Kissinger said to me when I left, he said, I'm very glad, Al, that you're
                    going as ambassador. But I wish you were going to a country more important to us
                    than Hungary. And I said, well Henry, you know, I've got to get some experience.
                    Perhaps when I come back you can do something about that. Of course, it never
                    happened because by that time Watergatewhen I finished, Watergate was bubbling
                    and I retired. But it was a fascinating job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn the Hungarian language?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>PUHAN: I took lessons but I found that the Hungarians really didn't want to talk
                    Hungarian to me because obviously my vocabulary was limited. And as you know
                    it's not an Indo-European tongue. It's extremely difficult. And I recognized the
                    fact that I had probably two years in Budapest when I first started. And I would
                    never use it again. Besides I had four young officers there including the PAO,
                    Clem Scerback, who all spoke Hungarian. And so if I needed any help with someone
                    to accompany me I had my choice of four people. I used German a lot. As you know
                    the legacy of the Austrian-Hungarian empire and what Hitler left was the use of
                    the German language. When I was in the villages, I'm talking to priests or
                    mayors or industrialists or something like that, I always used German. And with
                    the young people it was English. But I had enough Hungarian so I could say when
                    we had a reception or Hungarians were present, things likeHow are you? Come on
                    in. How are things? You know, a smattering of Hungarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what stage do you think the Hungarians began to get
                        into what in a small degree is a market economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: I believe it began inI went there in 1969. I think the germ of that thing
                    was sewn in 1968, one year before I got there with the so-called New Economic
                    Mechanism (NEM). Janos Kadar, the man who was imposed by the Russians on the
                    Hungarians in 1956, turned out to be a man who led them out of the wilderness.
                    Until last year. He was finally forced out and then died in 1989. But he told me
                    one time that he had a kind of agreement with the Russians that in return for
                    having his own way in running the Hungarian economy he would be willing to go
                    without any hesitation along with any political or foreign policy decisions the
                    Russians were making. He developed this New Economic Mechanism which became
                    known as Hungarian goulash communism. As you know it was the dissolution of
                    centralized management and bringing it down to the factory or farm manager.
                    You're the one who decides what to produce and how many and so on, and we'll
                    tell you if it's not right or so on.</p>
                <p>Hungary's Ouiet Revolution Toward Capitalism In 1970s</p>
                <p>So this quiet revolution in Hungary has been going on since 1968. When I got
                    there in 1969 relations between our two countries were very chilly still. There
                    were reasons for it. Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty was in our Embassy and had been
                    there for 13 years when I got there. And diplomatic relations were extant but
                    that's about all you could say for it.</p>
                <p>I arrived there in June. By August we had already managed to agree upon an agenda
                    that we would discuss. And we had resolved four rather small impediments to
                    better relations which caused the New York Timesread my book coming out in
                    1990to praise this action and call it not the sort of stuff that international
                    diplomacy is made of, but sometimes the symbolism was more important than the
                    actual action and it's a good indication of how things are developing between
                    the two countries and it speaks well for our American ambassador there, Alfred
                    Puhan.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So, I saw over this period of four years plus what I would call a development of
                    relations from abnormal to normal between two such different countries, a little
                    country of 10 million people, communist, and the mighty United States,
                    capitalist. And we had free movement and so on. The Cardinal was out of the
                    Embassy at the end of my second year and that made it possible for high ranking
                    officials of the U. S. government to come there. So I was there at the beginning
                    of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the cultural background and the
                        temperament of the Hungarian people also made them more predisposed to
                        follow that kind of an economic development than say some of the other
                        people like the Czechs? From my short experience, very short experiencejust
                        a week or two between the two countriesseemed to indicate to me the
                        difference between night and day in going from the Czechs to the Hungarians,
                        although there were other reasons for that. But I just wondered how you felt
                        about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: There is no question, no doubt about that at all. The Hungarians are a
                    very talented, clever intelligent people. They have demonstrated that by
                    contributing to our civilization in the United States everything from George
                    Solti and Eugene Ormandy and Joe Namath and Zsa Zsa Gabor and anyone you want to
                    name. All these have done very, very well in their own fields.</p>
                <p>By the way, I saw this at the Voice of America because you know we had there a
                    little bit of each of these countries at these desks. And you could always tell
                    the Hungarians were far more aggressive, far more willing to go ahead. The
                    Czechs perhaps because the long domination by Russians or by Germans and
                    Austrians has produced a kind of timidity in that, you could have knocked me
                    over with a feather when I learned that the Czechs threw out the communist
                    government. Really, that was something because I expected them to be pretty much
                    next to Ceausescu in Rumaniato be last.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I thought so too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>PUHAN: But instead they did it. Well, the Hungarians arethey have a talent for
                    this. I could tell you story after story. They were practicing capitalism when I
                    was there. I had a white Lincoln Continental as an official car. And of course
                    it was not only the only white Lincoln, but it was the only Lincoln in all of
                    Hungary. And when something went wrong with it there was no point in taking it
                    to a state garage. They couldn't do anything about it. But you could go up to a
                    third or fourth floor office where a little man sat with an eyeshade. He took a
                    look at the part that had to be produced and he produced the part. This was
                    going on all over the place and the government knew it and backed it in fact
                    quietly. At the same time having learned their lesson in 1956 because of the
                    clobbering by the Russians, the Hungarian insurgency, they were careful. But
                    they kept pushing as one of them told me one time. I don't remember whether it
                    was a journalist or a doctor. He said we always push just about as far as we
                    think we can go and then we push a little bit further. And if nothing happens
                    then the next time we push again a little bit further and that's what they've
                    done.</p>
                <p>So they have the disposition. Now, I look forward tothey're going to have a lot
                    of trouble of course because they have a big national debt. They're going to
                    have a lot of small parties and the communist party has changed its name. That's
                    not going to fool them of course and I suspect they'll get less than 17 percent
                    of the vote in this spring's elections that they've going to have. But, yes,
                    it's absolutely true. There's even a contrast as you know between the Czechs and
                    the Slovaks. The Slovaks are more like the Hungarians. The Czechs are quite
                    timid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They seem so much more bullying to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any anecdotes about the Hungarian situation
                        that you feel you'd like to put on tape here? Or would you care to comment
                        further?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Well, of course, they'll all be in my book.</p>
                <p>One of the storiesI heard laterconcerns the fact that the Hungarian communist
                    party was losing members year after year. So they finally decided to give some
                    incentives and they said that any member of the Hungarian communist party who
                    brings in a new member is relieved from attending party meetings for a period of
                    one month and does not have to pay his dues for a year. And any member who
                    brings in two new members is relieved of attending all party meetings for a year
                    and doesn't have to pay any dues for a year. And any member who brings in three
                    new members will receive a certificate saying that he never was a member of the
                    communist party.</p>
                <p>1973: Retirement</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Hungary your last assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, I retired after I came back in '73. As you know at that time 60 was
                    the mandatory retirement. The only way I could have remained on was for the
                    President to nominate me for another post which might have happened if Mr. Nixon
                    hadn't been involved in Watergate at that time. I imagine the thing farthest
                    from his mind was the making of ambassadors. So I decided that I might as well
                    retire. I didn't relish the idea of staying on even if they'd asked me in the
                    Department. So I quit in August of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you have any general comments now before we
                        close, any comments on your attitude and feelings about your career or
                        anything else that you'd like to say in conclusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PUHAN: Yes, Lew. I think I've had one of the most fascinating careers that any
                    man could have. I started out by accident in the Voice of America. In the short
                    period of 11 years I rose to be Program Director. I had a career as a Foreign
                    Service Officer which ended up with what every shavetail coming out of West
                    Point would hope would happen to himbecoming a general. I became ambassador and
                    how many people become ambassador anyway? Along the way I had interesting
                    assignments like the ones I describedthe Department's Office of German Affairs,
                    Executive Director, Bangkok. And in looking back I'm most grateful. I have
                    nothing but praise for what people like Foy Kohler and Llewellyn Thompson and
                    John Leddy and others with whom I've worked and for whom I worked and worked
                    with, accomplished. So I have no regrets and am most happy, and that's why I sat
                    down and decided one day to write for my children and grandchildren what has
                    become a book which is coming out presently. [It was published on December 13,
                    1989]</p>
