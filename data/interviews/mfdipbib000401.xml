                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me a little of your background—where you
                        were born, where you came from, a little about your education, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I was born in December of 1934 and began my travels in January 1935 at six
                    weeks when, as my mother recalled, I took the Twentieth Century Limited from New
                    York to Chicago to join my father and sister who were already out there. My
                    father had started work for Montgomery Ward. I grew up in the Middle West until
                    about age ten and then returned to the New York area. My parents divorced and my
                    mother moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, the home of Smith College, and began
                    working at Smith until she retired. I went to high school there and then on to
                    Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, up the Connecticut River a hundred
                    and ten miles. I graduated in 1956 and spent the next year on a Dartmouth
                    fellowship at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
                <p>As I was finishing off my first year studies at Edinburgh, and was getting ready
                    to travel for the summer, it dawned on me when I got a letter from the draft
                    board that I had not renewed my student deferment. I would like to remind anyone
                    who was not around in those times that the draft was a no nonsense thing in the
                    nineteen '50s when Eisenhower decided to beef up two eighteen thousand-man
                    infantry divisions, plus other elements of the army, reflecting the growing
                    concern about the Cold War and some of the activities of the Soviet Union,
                    particularly in Europe. So I was drafted and went into the Third Infantry
                    Division which was stationed in West Germany at Bamberg; our positions were up
                    on the Czech border and the Fulda Gap where we trained and would have been
                    annihilated within about twenty-five seconds had war actually come. We were
                    using military equipment at that time that was basically from the First World
                    War except for the Garand Rifle which was from the Second World War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: We arrived in Germany in January of 1958 and I left in October of 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were protecting me when I was there at the Consulate
                        General in Frankfurt. You were all that stood between me and the Soviet
                        forces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: It was a thin reed, I want you to know. It was an interesting experience in
                    the sense that for the rest of my life I was, for reasons originally not of my
                    own choosing, involved in the Cold War on the periphery of the Soviet Union or
                    in the Soviet Union. I think that the element of having been in the military and
                    knowing a bit about how the military conceives its action plans on the basis of
                    civilian instructions—how they interpret threat in a concrete military sense—was
                    always of very great value to me. I think it helped in a practical way later in
                    more senior jobs in dealing with the military mission at our embassies, with the
                    military attach�s, with intelligence work and in understanding the dedication
                    that it does take to serve in the military, particularly in peacetime. That is
                    when you begin to get the slackness and the feeling of “why are we here?” We
                    certainly had an element of that in the nineteen '50s; however, we had enough
                    alerts and enough things to keep us busy so that the time passed pretty
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hungarian Revolution was about that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: The Hungarian Revolution was over by early December 1956, but it was exactly
                    that, together with the Suez crisis, which was seen as crippling NATO resolve
                    because of the conflict between the United States, Britain, and France, and
                    other elements which occurred in the mid-'50s, that led to the resolve to
                    rebuild the American Army after the end of the Korean War and to form it for the
                    first time to fight a nuclear war. The divisions were called pentomic divisions,
                    which was simply an acronymic form for a five regiment division. One of the
                    regiments was mobile for the first time, with helicopters that were not generic
                    to the regiment but were always available. I was in this regiment which was said
                    at the time to be the first helicopter assault regiment—I don't know if that is
                    truly accurate. So we were flying around in helicopters all over the place and
                    also guarding the atomic canon that now seems like the tyrannosaurus rex of the
                    military world. It was a gun that would throw a nuclear shell twenty-three
                    miles; I guess you hoped that it landed where you wanted it to land. When that
                    cannon came out of its cave at our base in Bamberg we would fly along behind in
                    case it broke down because the whole secret of being able to throw a shell that
                    far was in the breach; this had only been tried on railway guns and naval cannon
                    in the past. What we didn't want to happen was to have it break down so that
                    some squad of East German or Soviet commandos in place could come and steal the
                    breach. We were not actually told that, but that is what we figured out. The
                    wheels were something like twelve feet high and sometimes when we would go
                    through a German town they would shave off the church and part of the school and
                    we would have to stop and apologize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember seeing that thing go through; we are talking
                        about a real monster.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>FRY: We would fly down and put a perimeter around it; we had twenty-four people,
                    four machine guns and four BAR's, so we weren't kidding, and live ammunition
                    which was kept in a locked case that I as a sergeant was responsible for. It was
                    something that when I was at Dartmouth and the University of Edinburgh I hadn't
                    counted on for the next two years of my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are touching on something here that I think is very
                        important. In this oral history program the interviewees, mostly male,
                        belong to a generation in which the great majority of us have served in the
                        military, mostly with reluctance; but we did it and came away with the idea
                        that while this wasn't for us these were people who knew their job and it
                        was a very difficult job. There was a greater appreciation and understanding
                        of the problems and how to handle them and of what military force means than
                        came out of the next generation. Many who ducked the Vietnam War or the post
                        Vietnam period just don't have that military experience and they don't have
                        an appreciation for the military which still remains a major element of our
                        foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes. I would not argue that my Foreign Service judgments on the civilian
                    side would be so much different if I had not had military service, I don't know.
                    But I would say that, on balance, that part of the composite of my life was
                    positive, even though I didn't think so at the time. I never had a feeling of
                    what some people have described as bitterness over the fact that college
                    classmates were graduating from law school when I was just getting out of a
                    sergeant's uniform—and what had I been doing with my life the last three years.
                    I had a feeling of amazement that three years had gone by so quickly, and that
                    it was my fourth year out of college, when I returned to the United States and
                    entered graduate school. This time I decided to stay until I got a Master's
                    Degree, or at least complete the work for it. As fate would have it, as I was
                    being discharged, leaving active duty—not the final discharge as we had five
                    years of reserve duty—I saw a sign in a post office that said, “You can sign up
                    until November 5th, 1959, to take an exam for the Foreign Service of the United
                    States.” I had thought about the foreign service a lot in the past but it had
                    sort of slipped my mind for a while as I was concentrating on graduate school.
                    So I took the exam; I probably got my card in about the last day that you could
                    for that year. I have often wondered what would have happened had I missed that
                    date. Would I have wanted to take it a year later? The upshot was that I entered
                    graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to graduate school where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FRY: At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. That allowed me to live
                    fairly near home, I didn't live at home, in an area that I knew and in which I
                    had had odd jobs, knew people and could get temporary work. I was given, rather
                    it was given to the University and they bestowed it on me, a Ford Foundation
                    fellowship to help in the research that was being done for the establishment of
                    the “Four College Program” in which the purchasing of valuable and expensive
                    books would be combined by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Smith, and
                    Mt. Holyoke. They found that with costs rising it was nonsensical for Smith
                    College to purchase a five hundred dollar book on African art and for Amherst to
                    do the same thing, so they began to coordinate the purchases. I was one of the
                    people in that program funded by the Ford Foundation and that is how I earned my
                    way through; they also waived your tuition with that grant. While I was doing
                    the classwork I was also processing through the Foreign Service because I passed
                    the written and in the summer of 1960 I took the oral in Boston. The exam was so
                    different from the procedure used now that it appears to be almost neanderthal,
                    I suppose. Three on one as they used to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have done both types and I think the three on one works
                        better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I think the three on one—well, I don't know how you pick people out of a
                    group of fifteen and tell them that they are not real leaders. In any case, I
                    worked my way through that and then there was the security examination which for
                    me was quite interesting. By this time I was hard at work on a Master's Degree
                    on the investigation of subversion at the state level in the United States. I
                    had been very much angered by the investigation of Dartmouth College, while I
                    was an undergraduate, by McCarthy-type committees that were formed at the state
                    level, in this case the state of New Hampshire. The investigation was led by the
                    then Attorney General, Louis C. Wyman, later a Congressman from New Hampshire,
                    who was an arch-conservative, a prot�g� of Styles Bridges who was the Republican
                    old guard in New England. The investigation had no clear end except to prevent
                    the State of New Hampshire from being overthrown by a communist conspiracy. If
                    you lived in New Hampshire you would find this pretty funny, but if you didn't
                    live in New Hampshire and then were there as a student you would find it
                    hilarious.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>An example of the hysteria was a case that worked its way to the Supreme Court
                    involving a Methodist minister, a graduate of Yale Divinity School, named
                    Willard Uphaus. Willard Uphaus was a leader in the peace movement, not
                    appreciated at the height of the Cold War, who had people of all persuasions,
                    including communists, at his summer home in New Hampshire. The Attorney General
                    asked him for a list of the people and he refused. The Attorney General, as it
                    turned out, already had a list and all the license plates. The Supreme Court
                    held only that the State Legislature had the authority to convene a committee
                    such as the one that subpoenaed Willard Uphaus; nothing about the merits of the
                    subpoena or the facts in the issuance. Willard Uphaus was cited for contempt. At
                    age seventy some he was put into a one hundred and twenty-year old prison in
                    Concord, New Hampshire, where he languished for two years. He was finally
                    released by a lot of protests and sympathy movements. I went to see him in
                    prison.</p>
                <p>I tell all this only because when the FBI agent came to my house for the security
                    interview he asked me about where I had worked and what I had done, and I told
                    him. He said, “How is your school work going?” and I said, “Oh, fine. I am
                    working on a Master's Degree.” “What are you working on?” And I knew right then
                    that my name had been sent to the FBI as one of the men who had visited Willard
                    Uphaus in prison. I told him exactly what I was doing and we had a very genial
                    conversation about it. I say, to the credit of everyone involved, that as it was
                    a legitimate scholarly research project for a Master's Degree that was later
                    published, and that was the last I ever heard of it. I have often thought that
                    one of these days I would get my FBI file through the Freedom of Information Act
                    and see how they actually handled that. In any case, I completed my classwork at
                    the University and was called into the Foreign Service for January of 1961. I
                    asked for the next class so that I could complete at least the first draft of my
                    Master's thesis for approval. Then I could just touch it up and finish it. It
                    was rather complex in that it was a constitutional law thesis with a lot of
                    legal citations requiring some very careful checking.</p>
                <p>I sat in a restaurant/bar on January 20th, 1961, listening to John F. Kennedy's
                    inaugural speech. Knowing that I was going down in March to join the Foreign
                    Service, I was very moved by the speech. It seemed to be almost targeted at me
                    personally. In 1952 I had won the Junior Chamber of Commerce “I Speak For
                    Democracy” contest in Massachusetts. At the Boston award ceremony Kennedy was
                    the speaker. They played the record of my speech and he congratulated me. I was
                    very impressed with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>In the days of cynicism that can come later in life it is hard to remember how
                    bright and bushy tailed and positive you can feel about a new way of life that
                    is coming. I had always respected the State Department and the State Department
                    officers, particularly for what they put up with in the McCarthy period. I also
                    felt that diplomacy was much more complex than people in Congress wanted to make
                    it; that there were no black and white issues but an endless gray zone.So I was
                    very taken with Kennedy's statement that we were engaged in a long twilight
                    struggle, basically against communism, in which freedom must prevail, so “ask
                    not what your country can do for you,” and so on. I found that a nice send off
                    when I joined the Foreign Service in March 1961 and found that my
                    presuppositions were correct. In diplomacy there is the long gray zone of
                    negotiation and compromise and there are very few other things that you are
                    involved in in your career, except for mechanical things like visa
                    issuances—which aren't always so mechanical. Indeed the struggle against
                    communism as a philosophy was going to be long and hard.</p>
                <p>I had ended my Master's thesis by saying that serious damage had been done by the
                    misuse of power in investigating subversion at the state level. Instead of
                    taking an idea and forcing it to be debated openly and honestly in the
                    marketplace of ideas, which was what I had been taught that our system was going
                    to do, we forced it into a corner, into darkness, into basements and cellars. We
                    then talked about a conspiracy that was afraid to come out into the sunlight;
                    the long history of the Communist Party in the United States and the penalties
                    against even speaking the word communism. I think in the end the communist
                    philosophy as I studied it and later learned to live with in my professional
                    life, was so flawed at the beginning that there never was any hesitation in my
                    thinking that communism would fail. To jump ahead, when I reached the Soviet
                    Union in 1966, in the first month I realized how completely and totally it had
                    failed in the Soviet Union as any kind of a measure of an advancement of a
                    modern society. It was so obvious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think probably among most of us at that period it seemed
                        a great form of social control as far as maintaining power—I didn't think it
                        would collapse the way it did—but other than that it didn't work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FRY: I think one of the things we could discuss as we go along is something that
                    you in your own life don't notice as it is happening, it is contemporary; but I
                    see it now in retrospect of thirty years in the Foreign Service and three years
                    out. That is the influence of the information revolution on everything that
                    touched my life in the Foreign Service. I am not just speaking about computers,
                    but towards the twilight of communism about the influence of tape recorders, of
                    pocket recorders, of walkmen, of VCR's, of this endless wave of information that
                    even the most totalitarian systems couldn't stop. I began to be more and more
                    aware of it when I realized that Playboy magazines were bringing the equivalent
                    of thirty-five or forty dollars from Russian soldiers in East Berlin, for
                    obvious reasons in a puritanical society. Then I realized what it would mean if
                    instead of the self-printing, “samizdat” program of Boris Pasternak's works, for
                    example, in the Soviet Union, you could get a tape which had a reading of
                    Pasternak. Something that could be concealed in a cigar box, not papers that had
                    to be laboriously copied and carried around. Indeed that was exactly what was
                    happening. When I was in Finland I got to know the influence of Finnish
                    television, which had a lot of English language programs, on the people of
                    Estonia who were line of sight, only about forty-five miles from the
                    transmitter. The Russians couldn't jam it because they would have jammed Finnish
                    national television. So if you were going over to visit in Tallinn on one of
                    those summer cruises where you could go over for a day or two, one of the
                    highest priorities for a Finn was to take a Finnish-English and Finnish-Estonian
                    dictionary. In this way they were adding fuel to the fire because people were
                    beginning to tape things and put a translation with it and send it to people in
                    the interior, into the other republics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the period of 1961. You came into the Foreign
                        Service in March and you had, I assume, the normal basic officer training.
                        Could you give a little characterization of your fellow officers and what
                        their outlook was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: We had twenty-nine people in our class; a little bit larger than those that
                    had been coming in, but roughly the same size as others in that period. The
                    average age was rather high, about twenty-seven and a half or twenty-eight. What
                    made that interesting was that in those days, if my memory serves me, you could
                    not enter the Foreign Service if you were more than thirty-one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FRY: Another interesting thing was that there were two women in our class, both
                    very well educated and very fine potential officers, who because they married
                    American citizens, both Foreign Service officers, had to resign from the
                    service. Those were the archaic days when that was the way women were treated in
                    the American diplomatic service. I know that stunned me at the time because
                    after my first post I had begun courting Polly Gann, at the Georgetown School of
                    Foreign Service, who was interested very much in the Foreign Service. She was
                    from a family that was extremely well-educated and literate. Her father was
                    Ernest K. Gann, an author who was famous for his books on sailing and flying;
                    many movies were made from his books, The High and The Mighty, for example. A
                    Renaissance man if there ever was one. The mini-series Masada, which was one of
                    the most popular mini-series ever produced, was from a book he wrote called The
                    Antagonists. She was not a person, I saw right away, that was going to be
                    interested in staying home while I went to the office.</p>
                <p>As it turned out we were part of a group of junior officers in the State
                    Department who began to lobby actively against rules like this. I won't say it
                    was because of our lobbying, but this sentiment was growing stronger in each
                    class; the disappointment we felt when colleagues, who happened to be women,
                    married colleagues who happened to be men and had to leave the service. By the
                    end of the decade those rules were gone. Both of the women in our class were
                    reinstated in the Service after they had, of course, lost several promotions on
                    the rest of the people.</p>
                <p>The class had a high degree of military service. Several had been in the navy for
                    as long as four to six years, and one actually took a pay cut to come in the
                    Foreign Service. My pay, incidentally, on entering the Foreign Service in March
                    of 1961 was $5,400. I thought that was a pretty great amount of money
                    considering that in the military I was making $900 a year and in graduate school
                    I was making $125 a month. The class was highly motivated and we kept together
                    as friends over the years, even some I never truly saw again except to pass in
                    the hall. We figured out that after the first five years, four or five had
                    left—one for medical reasons and others because they decided it just wasn't for
                    them. Of those remaining the attrition rate was very low; in fact as we speak in
                    1993, I know of four from the class that are still in the Foreign Service.
                    Roscoe Suddarth was Ambassador to Jordan. Frank Crigler was Ambassador in
                    Somalia and Rwanda, and some were Deputy Chiefs of Mission. It was a pretty
                    solid class in the sense that we enjoyed it and stayed in for full careers and
                    left to do other things whenever we felt that mid-'50s was enough to do one
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first post was a very interesting one, I would have
                        thought. It was at a time when you could get a look at two different worlds.
                        You went to Trieste where you served from 1961 to 1963. How did you feel
                        about the assignment and what was the situation when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>FRY: At the end of the training class in June 1961, I was assigned to Geneva and
                    was going to take a French language course. We then went into another week or
                    two of very specialized consular training and the day before we finished my
                    orders were changed to go to Rome and study Italian one on one with a barrage of
                    tutors. They wanted a test to see how quickly a person could learn a romance
                    language and Italian was a language that I didn't know a word of. Also they
                    needed a junior officer in Trieste in September because the visa situation there
                    was fairly active for a small post, and there were other things to do where they
                    needed a first-tour officer. So I went to Rome and studied Italian very hard all
                    of July and August, and about half of September. I lived in an Italian hotel and
                    I tried to speak only Italian; I didn't have to work in the Embassy. The
                    Embassy, the Ambassador in particular, was extremely supportive of this program;
                    I was invited twice to the Ambassador's house for cocktails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Ambassador George Frederick Reinhardt, later killed in a car accident in
                    northern Italy. He had been Ambassador to Egypt and Vietnam. The Embassy didn't
                    ask me to come in on a Saturday and help out; language training was my business.
                    It did allow me to arrive in Trieste towards the end of September and by
                    November, when I was tested up there, I did get a three-three, which amazed even
                    me because I had a fairly low language aptitude on the entering test.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Three-three is considered a useful...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, I think it was called professional proficiency in your work, that is
                    you couldn't talk grand opera but you could tell people what they had to do to
                    go to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first three is for speaking, the second three for
                        reading, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>FRY: Yes. I always found Italian fairly easy to read because if I didn't know a
                    word I would glide over it and didn't worry about it too much. I subsequently
                    studied fairly hard in Trieste and since there were very few Americans there and
                    the consulate was rather small, there was no one my age, I tended to meet quite
                    a few Italians. Most of them didn't want to speak English or didn't speak it, so
                    my language got stronger. I started getting the Trieste dialect, which is a very
                    interesting dialect, woven into Italian because when I asked about a word they
                    would give me the Triestine word, not thinking too much about it. This led to
                    situations such as one at a dinner party out of Trieste when someone was talking
                    about music and how the Italians love opera, etc., and I said, “Every morning
                    about six o'clock I have a toothbrush that comes down my street singing while
                    cleaning the street.” They all looked at me wondering what I was saying, and I
                    said, “Well you know what I mean, he's a toothbrush and he sings.” As it turns
                    out, it was the difference between spazino, street sweeper, and spazolino, the
                    Trieste slang for a toothbrush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Trieste when you arrived there
                        in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Churchill, in his 1947 Fulton, Missouri, speech on the Cold War—and I was
                    very aware of that speech as we all were in the '50s and early '60s—talked of
                    the iron curtain that was descending from Szczecin in the Baltic to Trieste in
                    the Adriatic. Trieste in 1961 was only six years away from the severe violence
                    in the main square where students had been fired on by British soldiers and
                    Italian constabulary. Trieste was then the Free Territory of Trieste. It had not
                    been determined how Trieste would be divided between Yugoslavia and Italy.
                    Trieste did not have representation in the Italian parliament; it was occupied
                    by five thousand American soldiers and about an equal number of British.
                    Fortunately for the Americans, they were responsible for public health and so
                    on; the British were responsible for public security. So they were the ones
                    involved in the student uprising against the possibility of going to Tito.
                    Yugoslavia was not the friend that it later became to the West; this was still a
                    very dicey time in Yugoslavia and there were a lot of people in Yugoslavia who
                    wanted the B zone of Trieste, as opposed to the A zone which was more on the
                    Italian side, simply to be annexed without any agreements. What had happened was
                    that the earlier negotiations that had been headed by Ambassador Tommy Thompson,
                    who was then Ambassador to Austria, and Ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, who was
                    then Ambassador to Rome, and others, had really worked out an agreement on
                    Trieste. That finally came to pass and time allowed emotions to recede. By 1961
                    I have to say that Trieste was fairly calm, in that the border was
                    businesslike.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>As diplomats, we were given a three-month multiple entry visa to go across the B
                    zone into Yugoslavia proper. You needed it to get into the B zone which the
                    Yugoslav military handled. There was a five-kilometer military zone on each side
                    of the border outside of the city that was very strictly controlled. The
                    situation was always a little tense and there were occasional shootings, but
                    nothing of the seriousness that happened in the mid-'50s. I used to go into
                    Yugoslavia a lot, even down the Istrian peninsula to Pula, over to Abbazia, the
                    Italian name for Opatija, and over to Rijeka (Fiume). All still Italian speaking
                    were all the waiters, the people along the shore, the people who fixed your car.
                    I was able to use Italian and I felt very comfortable, and they did too. They
                    liked Americans. I was able to go in there quite a bit; my diplomatic passport
                    had to have a pull-out page by the time I left, I had gotten so many Yugoslav
                    visas. To say that I went across the B zone to the beaches would simply be to
                    say in Washington, DC, that you went to Georgetown. We are talking about a very
                    small distance there to enter into Yugoslavia proper. The line came right into
                    the city, and on Saturdays and other shopping days the peasants from Slovenia,
                    where the land was very fertile as opposed to the solid rock lunar landscape of
                    Trieste, would flock in with marvelous vegetables and melons; they would just
                    fill up the Trieste market. That kind of flow of life had been reestablished and
                    it gave an air of tranquility to a situation which was still a little dicey in
                    international politics. But as far as people on the ground were concerned, they
                    had had enough of it. So as the border finally was agreed upon, it was pretty
                    much the A and B zone that I had known.</p>
                <p>After the mid-nineteen '60s, when the Italians in Trieste started having a
                    representation in the Parliament, I would consider the Trieste situation went
                    off the burner on everybody's scale. Also, Yugoslavia had begun to change its
                    attitude toward the Soviet Union. I might mention one thing very briefly to show
                    you how sensitive issues were in the Cold War. During my time in Trieste,
                    Italian socialists were not allowed to have a visa to enter the United States
                    without a waiver. This meant getting their passport in advance; sending a
                    telegram which took a long time from our post because it had to be encrypted by
                    hand on the one-time pad system and sent to Rome where it was decrypted and sent
                    to the Department, back to Rome and so on. It took a long time to get
                    approval.</p>
                <p>We had the case of a man named Solari who wanted to go to the United States on
                    private business, though he was the Senator from that part of Italy and a very
                    distinguished Italian patriot during the war—not a communist, but he was a
                    socialist. We had to get a waiver and to write in big red letters where he could
                    enter in New York. Solari's company had been picked by the airports in the
                    United States because of the famed Solari clock that you still see all over the
                    world. The clock where suddenly you hear a click, click, click, and all the
                    times and flights and places flick around on these little chits; it is the clock
                    used at Dulles airport from the day it opened. Solari was going to the United
                    States only for business. So here we were outfitting our installations all over
                    the United States with the product of his company and he couldn't enter without
                    a waiver that made him look like he was the son of Joseph Stalin.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>All of that eventually changed in the apertura a sinistra, the opening to the
                    left, in Italy when we decided the socialists weren't such bad chaps after all
                    since they were in power in England and France, and were a major power in
                    Germany. All the other NATO countries seemed to be going socialist, not to
                    mention Scandinavia. Somebody finally said, “Why are we punishing the Italians,
                    they eventually joined us in the Second World War, let alone afterward.” Those
                    are the highways and byways of fighting the Cold War by punishing honest Italian
                    Senators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This visa thing was following pretty strict standards. At
                        the time you were doing this, I was running the Consular Section in
                        Belgrade. I could pick up the phone and get my waivers over the telephone
                        from our immigration people in Vienna.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes. Near the end of my time we were finally authorized to do that. At first
                    the small post in Trieste could not pick up the phone and cut through the red
                    tape, it had to go through all the paper work. The added fillip was that Trieste
                    was still considered a special location since it wasn't, at that time,
                    technically a part of Italy. It was still the Free Territory of Trieste, and
                    still had a certain connection with the United Nations. You look on the maps of
                    that time and it says Free Zone, US Zone, Yugoslav Zone. But that began to pass.
                    Fortunately, and I say fortunately because of the workload that would have been
                    involved, Trieste was not responsible for processing immigrant visas. Immigrant
                    visas were done in Genoa, Naples, and Palermo, is my memory, and what we would
                    do when someone would come and say they wanted to emigrate to the United States
                    was to give them the materials they would need and those materials they would
                    have to send to the appropriate place. Our non-immigrant workload I wouldn't say
                    was excessive, but there were a lot of people in Trieste who by the standards of
                    the time had rather shady backgrounds because Trieste had been annexed by Hitler
                    into greater Germany—Trieste, Croatia, and a part of the Alto Adige.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They annexed Austria and this was formerly part of the
                        Austrian-Hungarian Empire.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>FRY: Exactly. And Trieste was always the main port of the Austrian-Hungarian
                    Empire. It was heavily German-speaking. The buildings were built by Germans, and
                    many of the businesses were headed by people with clearly Germanic names. So
                    there were a lot of questions on the denazification issue. Many of these people
                    had come out all right. I might insert that we had a very large CIA contingent
                    in Trieste; it was larger than the State Department by some triple. There were
                    very heavy undercover people who sold insurance, were in shipping and whom I
                    didn't know about at the time but found out years later were an integral part of
                    the network. They had a double net and a lot of the people who worked there were
                    managed from Switzerland, instead of from Rome, because these were the people
                    who were doing the penetration into Yugoslavia. Also there was a team that
                    interrogated people who had fled Yugoslavia and Albania, which was a real black
                    hole at the time for intelligence. The only Albanian speaking Foreign Service
                    officer that I have ever heard of, at least bilingually, was a guy named Steve
                    Peters who had been stationed in Trieste as the deputy consul for several years.
                    They then had Albanian speaking CIA employees or others on contract who, at the
                    San Sabba Refugee Camp, used to interrogate people who had come across the
                    border or who had escaped on small boats and had worked their way across the
                    Adriatic up into the Italian side. Wherever they landed they were sent up to
                    Trieste for preliminary interrogation and then they were sent down to a larger
                    camp outside of Rome.</p>
                <p>I had to go to San Sabba sometimes to talk to Albanians who had a claim to
                    American citizenship, who would say that they were born in New York, had a
                    sister in the United States and we had to process through to see if this was
                    true. San Sabba was, incidentally, a place where they used to process salt, so
                    they used to call it the salt mine. It was a beautiful warehouse structure, very
                    thick to keep dampness out and was really kind of a scary place as it looked
                    like a prison though it wasn't built to be a prison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find this fascinating. I knew this was taking place but
                        it seemed sort of unreal because at the time I went to Yugoslavia and served
                        in Belgrade for five years, from 1961 to 1967. Here you were treating
                        Yugoslavia as an enemy nation while we were sitting there and we could go
                        anywhere. We really felt that they weren't on our side for practical reasons
                        but nobody in Yugoslavia from Tito on down had any doubts that the real
                        enemy was the Soviet Union. All their radar pointed east.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>FRY: I never had a single problem traveling alone in Yugoslavia. I visited
                    Ljubljana many times. I took former Ljubljana residents, who went with me for
                    protection as they thought I was a white flag, back for the first time since the
                    war. I got to know our people, Bob Barry, a Dartmouth classmate and others, in
                    Zagreb. I always thought Yugoslavia was a wonderful place along the shore. I had
                    traveled there as a student in the summer of 1957 before I went into the army.
                    When I was in Yugoslavia, I was perfectly comfortable; I loved the beaches. The
                    problem, of course, was that for their own propaganda reasons they had to keep
                    the pressure on the border until they were sure that the resolution wasn't going
                    to be something in which they lost territory. The Italians really wanted Istria,
                    which was Italian speaking, and Slovenia; without that Trieste had no food.
                    There is that seventeen mile rocky road, now improved, and no airport until
                    Venice. Trieste was really out on the end of a stick; nothing there.</p>
                <p>I would like to say something about George Kennan, then President Kennedy's
                    ambassador to Yugoslavia. One thing that influenced my life quite a bit, the
                    direction of my Foreign Service career certainly, was that as the most junior
                    officer in Trieste I often met Ambassador George Kennan, who would very
                    frequently come by train, particularly in the winter when the weather was bad,
                    from Belgrade to a small station on the Yugoslav side called Sezana. The reason
                    that the train stopped in Sezana was that the Yugoslavs had taken the Wagon Lit
                    cars that belonged to companies in western Europe; they didn't pay for them but
                    simply seized them and used them on their train system. Therefore they could not
                    allow those cars to come into the West because they would be seized. Also, the
                    tracks from Trieste had been ripped out, so they couldn't come down even if they
                    wanted to. There was no way, except for one freight line, I think, with a lot of
                    controls to get into Yugoslavia without switching around in Trieste. The upshot
                    was that you didn't have the famed Orient Express anymore. The Orient Express
                    stopped in Trieste. Somebody had to go up, for a VIP or an Ambassador, to
                    Sezana, pick them up and drive them down to Trieste, wait at the train station
                    until their train came in, and see that they were safely on to Milan or Venice,
                    wherever they were going to get an airplane.</p>
                <p>When I first met Ambassador Kennan I was scared stiff. I had read his books in
                    college, and he was a towering figure then. He turned out to be, of course, a
                    very delightful human being, a wonderful man, someone for whom I have had the
                    deepest respect all my life. He had his children with him—this was his second
                    family, I believe. His older children were in their late teens or college—I knew
                    a daughter who was about ten or twelve then and a son about seven or eight. His
                    son loved to mess around with me. He would come to the Consulate with me when I
                    went to send the telegram that the Ambassador had arrived, and then take it with
                    me to the Post Office to be sent through the regular commercial system. Then I
                    would go and have soup with the Ambassador at the station and talk with him for
                    a long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>My first promotion came at the end of my second year in Trieste. I was promoted
                    from FSO-8 to FSO-7. It wasn't high enough to let me become a consul but I was
                    very happy to get another twelve hundred dollars a year. The very first letter
                    of congratulation that I got was from Ambassador and Mrs. Kennan. I have always
                    treasured it. He said, “We know you deserve it and we want to thank you for your
                    many kindnesses and courtesies to our family. We wish you success in your
                    Foreign Service career.”</p>
                <p>Actually, it was talking with Kennan a number of times that decided me to apply,
                    as my next assignment when I left Trieste, for something dealing directly with
                    the Soviet Union rather than the periphery as we were doing there. So when our
                    inspectors came right at the end of my assignment I found out that I was
                    assigned, on direct transfer, to work in the Office of Soviet Union Affairs on
                    the economic side. We didn't have cones then—cones being the division of labor
                    that the Foreign Service was divided into later, consular, administrative,
                    political, economic. Prior to the cone time you just applied for a job in
                    economics. I had no particular economic background but thought it would be
                    interesting and I would learn on the job. So I went from Trieste directly into
                    the Department in October of 1963 and learned what it was like to work in the
                    State Department. I had never set foot in the Department itself except for a
                    photograph-taking session and a couple of visits to offices to learn what the
                    State Department looked like when we were in the training course at FSI.</p>
                <p>My break-in was tragically colored by the assassination of President Kennedy. On
                    that occasion in November of 1963, I was at my desk and literally heard in the
                    hallway the sounds of shouts and screams and running. I had no idea of what was
                    happening and I ran to the door to hear, “Kennedy has been shot.” In about
                    twenty minutes that building was simply shut down. People just went to their
                    safes, put all their classified material in, and sat at their desks in complete
                    shock. They didn't know what to do and they just began to drift out of the
                    building. I am sure that people who had jobs where they had to stay, in
                    communications and other places like that, and the higher ranking people,
                    probably stayed. We didn't have television very much in the building in those
                    days so you couldn't go watch it anywhere. I didn't have television as I was
                    still staying in a hotel, so I wandered over to a friend's house who lived
                    nearby and we spent the rest of the day listening to the news and going up to
                    the White House, and standing in Lafayette Park, during the evening.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I mentioned before how much I had been moved by the Inaugural speech. And I guess
                    because I had met him and shaken his hand, I was as caught up in the Camelot
                    myth as much as anyone else and was not assessing Kennedy the way I would assess
                    him now. I was assessing the Cuban missile crisis and other things that had
                    happened, which was all you had to go on at that point in history. I think my
                    shock was as much as anybody else's and maybe personally a little bit more in
                    the sense that I identified my coming to Washington with his call to join the
                    government and roll back the forces of darkness and to join the good fight
                    against communism. I also remember watching the funeral cortege which came right
                    by the State Department. Most of us wept at this sight. The only thing I have
                    ever seen in my life which compared with this true sense of grief of the people
                    who were watching was, curiously enough, a funeral in Moscow, where all things
                    are staged and everything is kind of stilted and no one shows any emotion. It
                    was the funeral of Yuri Gagarin, the first cosmonaut, the first man in space,
                    who was killed in a flying accident. His funeral was very moving because it was
                    the only time I ever saw in the Soviet Union, then or later, true emotion in the
                    man on the street as his cortege came by. It reminded me then, and still does,
                    of the temper and the sense of feeling while watching Kennedy's cortege come
                    by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Soviet Affairs? You were there from
                        October of 1963 to June of 1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: The principal activity right at the start had to do with Kennedy's decision
                    to sell grain to the Soviet Union. It has become commonplace in recent years for
                    countries to sell to the Soviet Union. It is hard to remember that this was a
                    terribly controversial decision. This was aiding and abetting the very enemy
                    that you said you were going to fight. It was assisting their economy, which led
                    to “a fat Russian is a happy Russian,” “you won't erode communism with people
                    being fed, you will erode communism without any bread,” right down to very silly
                    things. The right wing launched a tremendous campaign which had a letter writing
                    element, because of which I spent half my time in responding to Congressional
                    inquiries. One which I remember very clearly: the reason that the Soviet Union
                    is buying the grain is so that it can make alcohol which it can use as primers
                    for a special hand grenade they have invented which will be used against NATO
                    forces. Another: the Soviet Union is taking the grain sacks and putting, instead
                    of USA and the handshake symbol, USSR on them and sending them to other
                    countries. No grain to the Soviet Union was shipped in sacks, it was shipped in
                    things like the sterilized tanker Manhattan and other bulk cargo grain ships, it
                    was off loaded with suction pumps in Odessa, and so forth and so on. We had to
                    answer all this stuff because there were people who really believed it. That was
                    one of the first things.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The other thing was that I had to process, this was my specific job, all the visa
                    requests for any “Soviet businessman” who was coming to the United States or was
                    coming to confer with the Amtorg Trading Company, which was a US corporation.
                    This was a holdover from the pre-Second World War and Second World War Russian
                    Purchasing Agency in New York that had American employees as well as Russian
                    employees. It was considered a hotbed of spying and industrial espionage. So
                    every time a Russian wanted to come over here and said he was coming on
                    business, I had to call up the businesses, make sure of the exact time of the
                    appointment, etc. It was very time consuming; I might be working on three or
                    four at one time and have to make thirty or forty calls for each one. Then at
                    the end of each week the FBI liaison with the State Department would come in and
                    I would give him all the information so that they could surveil these people.
                    Then we had to get the visa approved and I had to write the waiver request, and
                    so on. So that was another element of the work. For each Russian businessman—and
                    plenty of them weren't businessmen, they were obviously a certain level of
                    espionage, but not the Abels and the spies of fame; these were the journeymen,
                    plumbers coming in to see what they could see in the factories—it took a lot of
                    time.</p>
                <p>Other things included working on the air traffic arrangement; Pan American and
                    Aeroflot were chosen to have reciprocal flights between the countries. You
                    remember that we had no American planes flying into the Soviet Union directly
                    when I first started working on Soviet affairs. To have a military flight go in
                    to supply the Embassy was a very big deal and it took a very long time to
                    arrange each and every flight. The end of all this work—and I worked on this all
                    the time that I was on the desk; I was in the group that was meeting with the
                    Russians because it had the economic slant, of course, on the freight and
                    passenger revenue—was that the first flight came through when I was consul in
                    Moscow in the fall of 1967 or spring of 1968. I was at the airport collecting
                    the passports from the pilots after the first Pan Am flight came in. We had
                    other agreements that we were working on—I wasn't involved directly but I would
                    sit in and take notes when I was called upon to do it—and one was the first
                    consular agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. We had
                    Americans in jail, we had Americans who had been arrested for manslaughter,
                    accidents, and so on, without the benefit of a consular agreement. There was no
                    access to prisoners unless the Soviets allowed it. I later benefited from the
                    consular agreement during my time in Moscow; I processed five arrests of
                    Americans, attended trials, hired lawyers for them. I was benefiting at that
                    time at least from the first muscle-flexing of the agreement. Later the
                    agreement was far more effective when the bugs were worked out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to your time when you were on the Soviet desk. What
                        was your impression of the Soviet officials that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FRY: I dealt with very few Soviet officials directly, except for some junior
                    officers in the Soviet Embassy whom I later found out were usually of the
                    intelligence variety. I met them mainly socially through the encouraging of all
                    junior officers of Embassies to join our International Junior Foreign Service
                    Officers Club in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period of, what was it called—JFSOC? This was
                        very much a part of the Kennedy mystique—youth is important. The young
                        Foreign Service Officers had a lot of clout at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: We were encouraged to socialize with other Embassies, but of course the
                    Russians were very suspicious of this as were the Eastern Europeans. We also
                    sponsored and raised money for and did all the administrative work for the
                    Junior Foreign Service Officers' Fourth of July reception which was popular for
                    many years before the eighth floor was rebuilt. We had over a thousand people,
                    including Lyndon Johnson's daughters, two years in a row, who would come to see
                    the fireworks from the balcony of the State Department. I met a couple of
                    Russians that way. Then I did meet some Russians because I had to deal on visa
                    matters and I sometimes had to clarify something about the businessmen who were
                    coming. And so in 1964 and 1965, when I was in Russian language training, I was
                    invited to the Embassy on Soviet National Day. I knew enough people there to be
                    invited. There was very little socializing except in a formal setting. Almost
                    none that I know of. I asked a Russian diplomat to come to a friend's house to
                    watch a Muhammad Ali fight in the mid-'60s and he very much wanted to come
                    because there would be a lot of junior diplomats there, but in the end he didn't
                    come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FRY: They were very, very professional. I had great admiration for their language
                    training and the background that they had received prior to their assignment to
                    the United States. One of the people we dealt with was Georgi Korniyenko.
                    Korniyenko later became one of the highest ranking officials in the Soviet
                    Foreign Ministry and had a very successful career. After the retirement of
                    Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin he was really their top American specialist for
                    many, many years. The reason I knew him and watched him operate was that I was
                    called up fairly frequently to take notes for memoranda of conversation, as one
                    of the junior officers, for such Deputy Assistant Secretaries as Dick Davis,
                    Richard Davies and for William Tyler, who was then Assistant Secretary of State
                    for European Affairs. Sometimes there would be just the two of them and myself,
                    and I would have to do the whole memcon. When I first did it I was very nervous
                    and scared; I read up on how to do it and I practiced and got to be pretty good
                    at it. Then they asked for me because I always went right down and wrote it out
                    in longhand—we had no computers in those days—and gave it to a secretary or
                    typed it myself. They always wanted it quickly to do a telegram to Moscow. I
                    also very often was called to escort the long-time Soviet Ambassador Anatoly
                    Dobrynin from the diplomatic entrance. He was dean of the Diplomatic Corps when
                    he left. That was how long he had been here. He probably ranks in the top five
                    of all the diplomats that I know anything about, certainly of the ones I have
                    read about. We are talking about a man who was simply superb in his diplomatic
                    role. That is why he was kept in this country for twenty some years, and he had
                    been deputy chief of mission before that.</p>
                <p>I got to know Dobrynin well enough so that when I was married in 1965, I was
                    still on the Soviet desk, he heard about it and congratulated me in the
                    elevator. When I was courting my wife, we were walking along the C&amp;O canal
                    up near Great Falls. It turns out that the circle that Russians were allowed to
                    travel in fell just short of Great Falls. I knew it because I had to keep track
                    of my Russian businessmen. Dobrynin was coming up the towpath with his wife
                    beyond the permissible point. He saw us and we stopped and I introduced him to
                    my fianc�e and we had a nice chat. I wanted to say, “Mr. Ambassador, you are out
                    of bounds,” but I had such deep respect and awe for the man that I couldn't find
                    it in my heart to ever tell anybody about it and I don't think he had a clue. I
                    figured a man the stature of Dobrynin on the tow path was going to be just fine
                    as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on the Soviet desk, what were you absorbing
                        from those who were dealing with the Soviet Union as professionals at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FRY: I think that what I was absorbing was that there were two elements you
                    always had to take into account in dealing with the Soviet Union. The first was
                    that you had to follow the shield that the administration wanted to put on its
                    activities. You didn't want to look like you were coddling communists—there was
                    still a lot of that pressure. On the other hand we were involved in the day to
                    day operations of trying to manage a relationship between two increasingly armed
                    superpowers. You simply could not start each day by saying, “What can I do today
                    to weaken communism?” What you started your day with was, “What can I do to
                    solve this problem? How can we get this eighty-year old Jewish woman out of the
                    Soviet Union for medical treatment that her brother is willing to pay for in New
                    York? How can we get the Bolshoi Ballet out this time more simply, for a tour?”
                    In all of those things it was the human problems, it was the day to day
                    mechanics of managing a relationship.</p>
                <p>What I learned from people who were later Chiefs of Mission—Foy Kohler, Spike
                    Dubs who was Ambassador to Afghanistan and was subsequently assassinated, and
                    many other senior officials at that time—was that you don't carry any Cold War
                    emotions or any other personal beliefs into the relationship that you are
                    building on a professional diplomatic level with your counterparts. You do your
                    business, you do it professionally, you don't raise your voice. I heard Richard
                    Harding Davis, then a Deputy Assistant Secretary, call in a Soviet diplomat to
                    complain about a border incident or something in Berlin and give him very harsh
                    words in a very dignified, civilized, soft-spoken voice. He realized, and then I
                    learned, that the tone of your voice with your counterpart over the table has
                    nothing to do with how things come out, or how problems are solved or not
                    solved. What it can do is to arouse human antagonisms which may simply cloud the
                    real issues; you don't want that so you don't do it.</p>
                <p>I learned that making your point very clearly, so there is absolutely no doubt on
                    the other side as to precisely why you called them in, was the whole point, and
                    shouting did no good. Also, as in all diplomatic relations, there were those on
                    the military or intelligence side who welcomed confrontations with the Soviet
                    Union. They saw it as an opportunity for their work or for disruption of the
                    system. That was not necessarily compatible with what you were trying to do, not
                    that you would stand in the way of it. So there would be times when reciprocity
                    ruled. If an American's tire was slashed in Moscow, for whatever reason, you can
                    bet that a Soviet tire would be slashed in Arlington, in Bethesda, on 16th
                    Street, or wherever, about a week later. And vice versa. Even if it was a
                    hoodlum with no connection to anybody in America it would wind up with some poor
                    Foreign Service officer having to buy a new Goodyear out in Moscow. So
                    reciprocity was the name of the game and the order of the day. If I allowed a
                    Soviet diplomat a waiver to go to San Francisco to talk with someone there it
                    was only done with the understanding that an American would be allowed to go to
                    a closed area.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The closed areas in the United States and the closed areas in the Soviet Union
                    were monitored very carefully and they were part and parcel of the relationship.
                    It occupied a lot of time. The Soviets actually began their closed areas
                    program, that is areas denied to foreigners for any reason except on a very
                    special waiver, long before we did. We tried to negotiate out of it, but they
                    wouldn't so we just began one. I had a map in my office, and a map at home in
                    case I was called there, and a list of cities that were especially closed—under
                    no circumstances would waivers be granted. I had rings around New York, rings
                    around Washington, where they couldn't go beyond. If a policeman called the
                    State Department and said, “I arrested this guy for speeding in Chapaqua, New
                    York [sixty-five miles from New York City], what do I do with him?” then we had
                    one on them and they would have to let one of our guys off when they caught him
                    outside the ring in Moscow. It is minutiae like that that actually took up a lot
                    of time on the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Russian training, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I asked to go to Moscow and as part of that there was Russian language
                    training at the Foreign Service Institute. I had started trying to learn some
                    Russian on my own, to get an idea of the language. I was accepted for assignment
                    to Moscow, to go in June or early July of 1966, so in September 1965—I had been
                    married in the summer of 1965—I was released from the desk and began Russian
                    language training for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were taking Russian from 1965 to 1966?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: From the late summer of 1965 to the end of June in 1966 and then went to
                    Moscow immediately afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Moscow from 1966 through 1968. What was the
                        situation there when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>FRY: In a curious way, we were allowed to do things then that subsequently we
                    were not allowed to do. I will tell you a quick story. When I went to Europe
                    from New York in the summer of 1966, my wife and I took the United States,
                    landed in Le Havre and drove—I had my Ford Fairlane which had been specially
                    built for Russian roads, special springs and so on—through Scandinavia, stopping
                    in Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki, and on to Leningrad where we stayed for
                    three days over Soviet Naval Day. I had a movie camera—I had never signed in at
                    the Embassy, I was going strictly on my visa, the Soviets gave me permission to
                    drive in, the Embassy gave me permission to drive in—and went up along the Neva
                    River and filmed the whole review of the Soviet fleet and the newest cruiser,
                    the head of the Soviet Navy coming across in his launch; I took pictures of the
                    crowd, people waving at me. Then we went to Novgorod, stayed overnight in a
                    hotel there and did all the tourism there. Finally we drove through Kalinin,
                    which might have been a bit closed because it was industrial, had almost no
                    surveillance that I recall, got to the Embassy in Moscow, parked the car and
                    went in and introduced myself and that was the way I started my work. Several
                    years after that our side would never have allowed you to drive a car in and not
                    check in with the Embassy first as they would have feared a provocation or
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>In any case, I began work immediately in the consular section and my wife began
                    work, as a contract employee with USIA, in the downstairs cultural section which
                    adjoined the consular section and used the same waiting room. That was where the
                    library was. Mainly Africans students and foreign students came in to use our
                    materials. Very few Russians were allowed in because the militia wouldn't let
                    them pass the gate.</p>
                <p>The embassy situation was very correct but you were very much aware of the heavy
                    hand—the militia outside the Embassy, the concern that your Russian nationals
                    were working both sides as they probably had to. On the other hand, the
                    professionalism of the consular staff, that is the Russians—they were all women,
                    there were four and later five when I was there, headed by a woman named Mary
                    Litvenienko, famous to a whole generation of Foreign Service Officers—was
                    excellent and so cooperative and helpful. We weren't handling anything in the
                    consular section that was particularly sensitive, so the working environment
                    with our Russian colleagues was excellent. I became devoted to them, and showed
                    them movies when the Embassy was closed on Wednesday afternoon. They never came
                    to my house, but when I left they gave me a little chit on a commission store,
                    which is like our second-hand store, and said, “Go there and give this to the
                    woman.” That is all they told me. When I went there I was given a beautiful
                    samovar that they had arranged to give me which I still have.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Also, at that time we were experiencing a rather sharp increase in the number of
                    American tourists that were allowed to come in. For the first time Americans
                    were allowed to drive into the Soviet Union from Finland—which I was allowed to
                    do as a diplomat—and from Poland through Minsk and down into Moscow, and I think
                    they could drive from the crossing in Czechoslovakia—later closed after the
                    Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia—through Kiev and on to Moscow. So there was an
                    increase in tourism. Eventually the Pan-Am flights started and American tour
                    companies began to sell more and more tours. What this meant was a lot more work
                    for the consular section.It also meant that the Russians had to begin to realize
                    that you cannot allow tourism and then treat tourists like prisoners. You can
                    herd them around with Intourist but there are people who are going to want to
                    photograph a bridge or a cathedral in the center of town. To have militiamen
                    come up and want to snatch the camera for photographing a bridge that is on a
                    postal card being sold in the Soviet stores is ridiculous. We had to keep
                    reminding them that they were in the big time now and if they wanted tourists
                    they were going to have to be responsible for providing the tourists with the
                    tour they had paid for. We would get all kinds of complaints in the consular
                    section about rooms that didn't look out on the Kremlin and “what are you going
                    to do about it,” a lot of aggravations because we had to treat those complaints
                    seriously or tourists would report us to their Congress person.</p>
                <p>But on the serious side we also began to get elderly American citizens who were
                    returning to see relatives in the Soviet Union that they hadn't seen since the
                    '30s or the post-war period, and they died. Or those who were on tour ships,
                    like the Moore-McCormick Line that came into Leningrad and later Odessa, who
                    simply had a heart attack while they were on Soviet soil on tours. That required
                    us to do all of the Foreign Service things regarding death of US citizens
                    abroad, to arrange for shipment of the remains to the family, consular report of
                    death, etc. A lot of things began during my first watch in the Soviet Union that
                    we simply hadn't been doing before.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Another thing was that American tourists, not diplomats, were allowed to fly into
                    the Soviet Union from Afghanistan—from Kabul to Tashkent in Uzbekistan—and then
                    continue on a Soviet domestic flight, which was about a tenth the price of a
                    direct international flight to Scandinavia. They were booked from Kabul, say, to
                    Stockholm via a domestic flight. What happened was that a few Americans thought
                    that when they entered the Soviet Union they were just going to transfer to
                    another flight, then they would fly up to Leningrad and transfer to another
                    flight and go out to Helsinki. The first one, in the fall of 1966, brought in
                    hashish taped to his body; I won't say that he was an addict but he later told
                    me that he had made more than fifty LSD trips in college in the mid-'60s and he
                    was pretty messed up. He had also brought in hashish in a suitcase that had a
                    false bottom which we subsequently found out was provided to him by a KGB
                    informer in Kabul. The KGB has primary jurisdiction at ports of entry so it
                    meant that the minute the arrest was made at the airport we were dealing with
                    the KGB. We were not dealing with the KGB part that sent espionage agents
                    abroad, it was the domestic counter-intelligence and border guards. But in any
                    case, you were dealing directly with the KGB. On the first arrest I went down to
                    Tashkent and was able to talk with the gentleman. I went alone, incidentally,
                    and that was the first time in the Embassy's memory, I won't say ever but
                    certainly in a long time, that an officer had gone out alone some 4,000 miles
                    from the Embassy.</p>
                <p>Over all the time I was there I had four arrests in Tashkent; I went to Tashkent
                    eight or ten times round trip and I had a lot of surveillance but no harassment.
                    The KGB was very correct; sometimes I had to wait three days for an interview
                    and it made me pretty angry to sit around. But then I walked around the city and
                    got to know it better and began to do some reporting on what I saw, so it turned
                    out to be pretty valuable. I was also buying local newspapers; when you were out
                    of Moscow you bought up all the local newspapers you could and took them with
                    you. Usually the Russians let you do that. One time they stole them from my
                    hotel room because I had been down there more than a week and they finally
                    decided I was getting too much consecutive information rather than one or two
                    papers. They claimed that the cleaning woman took them. I said get them back and
                    they said that it wasn't possible. Then I saw the non-velvet hand of the KGB
                    stepping in to remind me that I was alone down there and had better behave like
                    a good consular officer instead of a showboat getting all the local literature.
                    I did manage to buy some books that we hadn't been able to get and they let me
                    get those. I guess they didn't realize what I was doing. I had to take my notes
                    with me, notes that I took at the trial: since I was writing more than was said
                    at the trial I had to carry those with me. Because it was very hot down there,
                    my wife helped me fabricate a case which was plastic so the papers wouldn't get
                    wet but was cloth on the outside. I would fold that in half and tuck that into
                    my shirt so that I always had that with me. I don't know if they knew that. So I
                    went to Tashkent for those trials.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The first person was released in November of 1967 on the fiftieth anniversary of
                    the Soviet Union. For two subsequent arrests, both gentlemen in question went to
                    prison. They got three to five years at Potma, which was in the R.S.F.S.R.
                    southwest of Moscow, where foreigners were kept. It was a minimum regime labor
                    camp where you made gloves and chessmen and things like that. One of the guys
                    was actually a deserter from the Vietnam draft from Ford Ord, California. He
                    wanted, for his defense, to throw himself on the mercy of the court because he
                    refused to fight against the Vietnamese. I argued against this and his lawyer
                    also thought this was not a good idea. I had hired a lawyer for him who was a
                    member of the Jewish community in Tashkent and whose family had lived there for
                    hundreds of years—there is a big Jewish community down there, including a
                    synagogue. Well the guy wanted this defense and did throw himself on the mercy
                    of the court. What he forgot, and what I had warned him of in the few moments
                    when I was alone with him, was that Russians don't like disloyal citizens, draft
                    dodgers, and deserters. He got three to five years at Potma.I might say, as to
                    the Soviet system of law, that I first saw it as a complete aberration of law
                    and order. But later on, in curious ways, I came to respect the system in this
                    sense: the preliminary investigation conducted by Soviet authorities is
                    extremely thorough. It encompasses the crime and the person's past; recidivism,
                    the recommitting of a crime, is very serious under Soviet law. Soviet law is
                    surprisingly lenient, or was, in many first cases, in particular with young
                    people. The second time you are caught it is very, very hard on you. You almost
                    always get a medium regime, or hard regime, labor camp, or even prison. Labor
                    camps aren't considered prisons. This young man, the deserter, had a very clean
                    record; the Soviets knew that I had documents showing what a fine young man he
                    was and who went astray just this one time. Whether it was true or not, the
                    documents were introduced into court. But he kept playing on the idea that he
                    could have been fighting in Vietnam but instead was for peace. I tried to tell
                    him that this was not necessarily a good defense in the Soviet Union because the
                    Soviet authorities, and in general the Soviet people, do not respect persons who
                    will not do their military obligations. It is a very serious offense in the
                    Soviet Union, a long penal sentence.</p>
                <p>I did not see that this defense would play as well as he was expecting it to and
                    indeed it did not. Basically, there is a judge and two lay assessors, who are
                    factory people put into white shirts for the day, but the judge makes the
                    decision. After the American had a chance to testify and his lawyer appealed for
                    him, the prosecutor asked for five years. The judge sentenced him to three to
                    five years. The judge concentrated on the fact that he had entered the Soviet
                    Union with the drugs, that he would have had an opportunity to try and sell them
                    in the Soviet Union, and even if it was not in the Soviet Union he was going to
                    take them to another country where he would condemn people to a life of using
                    drugs. The Russians were very, very strict and very much law and order both on
                    their own people and on foreigners in the matter of drugs. This was long before
                    it was fashionable in the US to be so hard on port of entry drugs; we were
                    strict but not anything like it became later.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The Russians were very hard on these people. He went to prison, and two others
                    that I handled all served their time. One, who was an Hispanic-American, opted
                    hard-line, that is wouldn't cooperate and took a Buddhist stance and refused to
                    help his defense attorney; he went into a silence strike when he was sentenced
                    to prison. Finally the Russians got tough with him and put him into a medium
                    regime part of the camp where he had to work pretty hard. The end product was
                    that instead of getting out in three years they made him stay four. That proved
                    to me that the best thing you could do once you were in their hands was to
                    cooperate in every way, because you weren't going to make your point in a
                    totalitarian system by pretending that you were tougher than the camp guards.
                    The final case I was working on as my esteemed colleague Robert Barry, who later
                    became Ambassador to Bulgaria, and Indonesia, and many high level stops along
                    the way, came to replace me. The outcome of that trial was Potma, also.</p>
                <p>One of the saddest cases I had was a person not in good health; he was a drug
                    user, had been working in Spain, owned a bar there, was married to a British
                    woman, one thing and another. He got all involved in stolen cars, driving them
                    to the Middle East, and had decided finally to make a killing on the hashish. He
                    went to the same store, got a false bottom suitcase—the same store that supplied
                    the first American with a false bottomed suitcase—and when he walked into that
                    airport they had dogs, photographs, the works. He also had a vest, which was de
                    rigueur for smugglers in those days, lined with flat pressed hashish. Never was
                    a person nabbed and nailed so cleanly. They had a movie of undressing him while
                    he was standing there with a shocked expression, peeling all this stuff back
                    with the dogs going crazy. Anyway he was not in such good health and the upshot
                    of this was that he went into the labor camp—this was before prisoners were
                    brought up to Moscow where we could see them and offer them medicines in the
                    program that the State Department introduced into the consular system to make
                    sure right at the start that there were no medical problems—with a vitamin E
                    deficiency. He lost most of his hair, a lot of his teeth, and his skin was bad.
                    When he finally was released, he got three to five years but I think they let
                    him out a little early because the Russians were getting worried, my colleagues
                    saw him at the airport on his exit flight and he looked like an old man and he
                    was only in his early ''30s. This was the down side of messing with Soviet
                    authorities. Even if you tried to cooperate you were still in a labor camp far,
                    far away from, in those days, any direct Embassy support or moral support; you
                    just didn't see anybody for a long time that you could talk to. Plus, the camps
                    were very dangerous.</p>
                <p>There was the case of Newcomb Mott. As I was preparing for the Soviet Union, a
                    young American illegally but inadvertently used a small border crossing in north
                    Norway that was only for Norwegians. He was tried in Murmansk and was sentenced
                    to the Gulag, I forget for how long, for illegal border illegal crossing,
                    another KGB operation. This was in the spring of 1966. The Soviets said that
                    Newcomb Mott committed suicide. We say that he was murdered, probably by other
                    prisoners who were on the train who were hard core criminals and really tough.
                    They probably killed him for his watch and whatever else he had on him. An
                    autopsy quite a bit later did find what was compatible with a stab wound, among
                    other things; he was beaten and was probably strangled.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>This was a very serious game in the Soviet Union with regard to Americans who
                    were arrested and we took it very seriously. I traveled about sixty thousand
                    miles alone in the Soviet Union; to Odessa, Kishinev, Minsk, Kiev, Leningrad
                    where two young Americans were arrested. They had just been released from the
                    Army. This was in the fall of 1966 shortly after I arrived. They did some black
                    marketing and also stole a bronze bear from the Europa hotel in Leningrad. They
                    were charged with all kinds of things. What was interesting about their trial
                    was that the Russians allowed the Intourist guides (women) who had helped them
                    along on their trip, and served as interpreters, to testify at the trial. The
                    prosecutor showed the notes that the women had taken about the behavior of the
                    men before they committed their crime and it was a real eye opener—why the
                    Soviets did it I didn't understand at the time—to see the detailed reports that
                    were made on each and every tourist the women were with. How they joked about
                    their own country, whether they appeared loyal to the United States, etc. In
                    other words, they were being set up as possible co-optees if later on they
                    professed a love for the Soviet Union and didn't like the American military.
                    What was bad about these two arrests was that one of the Americans had been a
                    pilot of a prop plane that used to fly along the East German-Czech border on
                    patrols and he kept part of his flight book with him. He had violated US Army
                    regulations, US regulations, everything; plus, it was just dumb.</p>
                <p>Even more interesting about this case was that the Soviet Union, for the first
                    time ever, allowed what we would call bail for one of the young men. His father
                    came over and the son was allowed to come down to Moscow on $10,000 bail. It
                    wasn't a bond. They had to send $10,000 to Soviet authorities which was put in a
                    dollar account until the disposition of the trial. The other, the military
                    pilot, was not allowed to leave his cell so the consul, Harlan Moen, and I had
                    to go and visit him in his cell a number of times. Both Americans were tried and
                    both of them were found guilty, but both were released with heavy fines.
                    Wouldn't you know that the fine for the one was the $10,000 that was already on
                    record. The other one I think was $15,000. I was thinking today that one of the
                    two young men came from Arkansas, and I wonder if he is still down there and
                    voted for Governor Clinton.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We were talking before about businesslike relations as opposed to the Cold War
                    hysteria. My message from those trials was that the Russians were telling us to
                    tell our tourists to be very careful, and to obey Soviet laws whatever they
                    thought of them. That is why they let us see and hear what the Intourist women
                    had recorded. They didn't do this by chance; they wanted us to know that they
                    were following people very carefully. So we put into our brochure, “You don't
                    joke about the Soviet system. You can discuss your country honestly, you can be
                    a normal American. In the Soviet Union you do not take souvenirs from your hotel
                    room, you do not take towels, you do not take bronze bears that turn out to be
                    by a famous sculptor. You toe the mark, however painful it might be. The Soviets
                    do not look on these things as shenanigans; it is hooliganism and its a crime
                    and you may be arrested.” You didn't want to scare the bejesus out of people who
                    were coming in to have a nice tour and most of the people were no problem. On
                    the other hand when you started getting younger people coming over on language
                    exchange programs you really had to give them a hard briefing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also a period of student rebellion which in an
                        earlier time—and maybe even now—would not have been accepted. In those days
                        young men, up to their early '30s, could get away with a lot more in the

                <p>FRY: By 1968 the greening of America was well under way. The Tet offensive had
                    passed in Vietnam and things were very difficult on the campuses of the United
                    States. What we had to tell people was that Soviet law applied to them while
                    they were in the Soviet Union, and in the Soviet Union you do not get on a
                    street corner and start preaching about democracy. We used to use the old
                    joke—to soften the pill about behavior patterns there—of the Soviet who was
                    arguing with an American and the American said, “Anytime I want I can get on a
                    street corner and denounce Lyndon Johnson as a fool.” The Russian said, “We have
                    the same freedoms here; anytime I want I can get on a street corner and denounce
                    Lyndon Johnson and call him a fool.” They got the point very quickly about what
                    that meant. There were Americans who came through Russia who had deserted from I
                    think either the Wasp or the Enterprise from Sasebo or Yokohama, Japan. There
                    were five sailors—a famous case—who deserted and went on Soviet television and
                    were later popping around Sweden and over the years have gone home. We did have
                    a lot of deserters who tried to convince the Soviets that they wanted to live in
                    the Soviet Union and didn't want to serve in the American army. Curiously
                    enough, in many cases, the Soviets just put them across the border into Finland.
                    They didn't want any part of this unless they were going to be really valuable.
                    Although once they put the Americans on television, I don't recall that they
                    ever did that again. These were just young sailors and I have forgotten all the
                    circumstances of why they had gotten in trouble on the ship and finally
                    deserted.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We had an Embassy program where every night one language officer would follow
                    television from when it went on to when it went off. Since there was only one
                    channel it wasn't hard. You monitored everything and had it written up in the
                    morning, dictated it to your secretary, or whatever, and that was on the
                    Ambassador's, DCM's, and others', desks by nine or ten in the morning. We often
                    picked up things on the Soviet news about Americans who had come to the Soviet
                    Union that we didn't know anything about. We would go to the Foreign Ministry
                    and ask to talk to the person to be sure he was there under his own free
                    will.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the Americans were willing to meet with us and sometimes they were not.
                    There were a number of cases like that. I don't know what the disposition of the
                    cases were, I can tell you that most Americans who had lived in the Soviet Union
                    for very long, who had gone there with the idea that they would be some kind of
                    hero for denouncing the war in Vietnam, very soon found out what the reality of
                    life was like there. Once the show was over and the television lights were off
                    it wasn't very pleasant. Most of them were not allowed to stay in Moscow, they
                    went off to smaller towns. I think all of them left at some point and the
                    Russians let them go; once their propaganda value was used they were simply a
                    drain on the Soviet economy.</p>
                <p>I would like to mention one other incident in Moscow that moved me a great deal.
                    It was the kind of thing that happens that for just a fleeting moment took the
                    hard mask off the Cold War and gave a glimmer of hope that underneath the Soviet
                    tyranny was the Russia that we are perhaps seeing a bit more of today. There was
                    first the Soviet shock after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Since this
                    followed President Kennedy's assassination by a very few years there was the
                    feeling that the United States was in serious trouble. Not just trouble because
                    we were bogged down in Vietnam, but, just as we later saw in the Soviet Union,
                    they began to say that American society was beginning to disintegrate. They were
                    looking at the worst that you could.</p>
                <p>I had television duty in Moscow the night after Martin Luther King was
                    assassinated. I will tell you what the Soviets had on their television. They
                    took all the television coverage of the riots in Washington, DC, and they
                    shortened them so what you got was a tape running all the worst case scenes in
                    about a three minute clip. So what I saw when the television came on was, with
                    the announcer saying almost nothing. There was the Memorial Bridge with the cars
                    backed up and a car burning so that there was smoke there, a machine gun
                    emplacement on the steps of the Capitol with sandbags, tremendous smoke pouring
                    out on H Street, solid smoke and fire, pillaging, National Guard at camps in
                    Stanton Park and Lincoln Park on Capitol Hill, and the Mall with armored cars
                    and men armed with automatic weapons who were marching towards and ringing Union
                    Station. All of this was shown on Russian television. I was stunned. I stopped
                    writing. At that time we did not have a taping facility in our homes—I don't
                    know whether the surveillance people in our Embassy were taping this. I wrote it
                    all up and we sent in a telegram immediately. I was not only stunned by what was
                    happening in the United States but by the Martin Luther King assassination
                    itself. That was the Martin Luther King assassination. Subsequently Robert
                    Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in June of 1968 wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, near the end of my time. When he was assassinated that was it. John F.
                    Kennedy was, for all kinds of weird, psychological reasons, revered in the
                    Soviet Union for his American University speech in 1962 or 1963. It was the
                    first presidential speech which sought to reverse the tide of Cold War polemics
                    and attempted to stake out new ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was early 1963. It was the summer before he was
                        assassinated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: That's right, it was after the Cuban missile crisis. In any case, there was
                    a sense of good feeling, that things could change. The Bay of Pigs was over with
                    the attempted invasion of Cuba by dissidents. The one gift that Soviets prized
                    more than anything and that I gave, rarely, to Russians who had been helpful on
                    my consular trips, was a Kennedy half dollar. I cannot tell you the effect that
                    this had on people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Yugoslavia and this was a very important gift
                        there too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, it was really a very moving thing to see their response. I gave it once
                    to a doctor who had treated an American in a car accident way out in the
                    Ukraine. It was a closed area and I was allowed to go there. He died and his
                    wife was injured and we brought her back to Moscow. I went there with the
                    Embassy doctor; it was near Poltava. I gave the doctor a Kennedy half dollar and
                    he was really moved; I won't say teary, but he couldn't thank me enough.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>When Robert Kennedy was assassinated it was more than anyone could think about.
                    We thought we should do something here, the flag went to half mast, of course.
                    The Ambassador, then Llewellyn Thompson, said it would be appropriate to have a
                    sign-in book, or else we got something from the State Department that said if
                    you wanted to do it it would be appropriate. So we got a big book for people to
                    sign and in the lobby of Spaso House, the Ambassador's Residence, we set up a
                    table and got a black cloth for it. I found in the library a Look magazine which
                    had a picture of Bobby on the cover. We cut it out and framed it and put that
                    over the book for it. I think we had some Bach or dirge or quiet-type music,
                    which is very typically Soviet. Whenever a prominent Soviet citizen dies the
                    radios immediately go onto dirges. I was given the first assignment to stand by
                    the book and greet people as they came in. The idea was to put out someone who
                    was on the country team, as I was as a section chief, but not someone really
                    high ranking like the head of the political section. Everybody thought that
                    nobody would come at the beginning and then the Foreign Ministry would say who
                    was coming over from the Foreign Ministry, if anyone, and then the Ambassador
                    might be there. I think we opened the book somewhere around ten in the morning
                    a. We had sent around a diplomatic note the day before saying that the book
                    would be open for signatures.</p>
                <p>The doors had not opened before the cars started pulling up. In the first car was
                    an official whose name I do not recall but he would be the equivalent of the
                    Deputy Director of the Office of Soviet Union Affairs in our State Department.
                    That was starting up pretty high; the next one was a Soviet military official,
                    then the Ambassador of Peru, or wherever. Suddenly Ambassadors' cars with the
                    flags flying appeared, another high ranking military officer, and so on. They
                    were coming through and there was no one in the House to speak of except myself
                    and a Chinese servant who had worked there since the forties and was a fixture
                    around Spaso House.</p>
                <p>I felt I couldn't leave him there and run to the phone, but then Georgi
                    Korniyenko, the head of American Affairs at the Foreign Ministry came in, and by
                    this time we were already on the third or fourth page of the book. Every visitor
                    was so deeply solemn, so apparently shocked, and with the dirge music, I was
                    close to tears myself. I just had to run to a phone. I told them what was
                    happening and all hell broke loose. The political counselor came right down and
                    I guess I was relieved of command. But the thing that struck me was that with
                    the Russian political hierarchy there was no sense of “you see that your country
                    is falling apart,” “you see what happens when you get into Vietnam.” Nothing
                    like that, I can only describe it as profound shock. Now they were really
                    getting worried that something was deeply amiss and deeply afoot in the United
                    States that might ultimately affect how the United States was looking at the
                    Cold War. In particular, they held to the conspiracy theory of President
                    Kennedy's death. The assassination of his brother, who was then running for
                    President of the United States, more or less confirmed their view of something
                    of much greater import. In their own country that would be the way it was since
                    there was no way for orderly change to take place. So they just saw this as some
                    massive kind of plot. I think they were so concerned about this that it actually
                    showed and was why they wanted to appear on the scene immediately. It was their
                    message that this had graver implications in their mind than just the death of
                    the man who was running for president.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FRY: Certainly, and until very recently we tended to filter many world events
                    through the prism of US-USSR relations. Whether they were appropriately placed
                    or not that was where they got imprisoned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, at this particular period of
                        time, of the morale, the caliber, the outlook of the Embassy staff and the
                        leadership of Llewellyn Thompson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I think over all the morale was very high in the officer corps. There were
                    spouses whose morale was low because they had not had an opportunity to really
                    learn Russian, or in some cases even to study Russian. They seldom left the
                    compound, they did not share in the excitement of the work in the same way that
                    someone who was at a desk everyday did, they were not reading the classified
                    messages to know what was really going on behind the scenes, and they were under
                    surveillance and their homes were being bugged by electronic devices. But over
                    all, I would say, morale was the kind of morale you get among professionals who
                    consider themselves sort of an elite. We were the shock troops on the farthest
                    reaches of the ramparts of the Cold War. You couldn't get any more into the
                    heartland than being in Moscow since at that time there were no other posts open
                    in the Soviet Union. When we walked into the Soviet stores, when we walked down
                    the streets, we were both in a fascinating country with a long history and in
                    the camp of the enemy. And the enemy was never far away. The surveillance was
                    heavy; the electronic surveillance was just assumed, in your automobile if not
                    always in your home, and in restaurants where you went and hotels where you
                    stayed when you were traveling. There was that constant sense of—we didn't
                    really use the term 'big brother' so much, although the term was used in the
                    public a lot from the Orwell novel—”big brother is watching you.”</p>
                <p>I think my own personal morale, and my wife's as well, was very high. For one
                    thing, we took vacations in the Soviet Union. We also spent three days in Odessa
                    touring and meeting the first US passenger ship, and three days in Vladimir
                    simply touring. We went through the Intourist program, though we could do some
                    things on our own. My Russian was getting good at this point on getting around
                    and I felt pretty comfortable talking to people on a one-time conversation
                    basis. I used to pick up some interesting, not earth shaking, information on how
                    life was going there. I think all of us who could travel, as part of our jobs,
                    loved it. That was a real sense of being on the front lines, you might say, and
                    of gleaning whatever information you could.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I remember going into a courtroom in Tashkent about a half-hour earlier than I
                    was supposed to—by this time they were so used to seeing me that they didn't pay
                    any attention to me anymore—and I sat in on a trial that was absolutely
                    fascinating and which they probably wouldn't have let me hear if they had
                    thought about it. There was a dentist in Tashkent who was shaving gold that he
                    was supposed to put into fillings. He had stolen gold—it was some kind of gold
                    scam—and there were people who had been arrested who had been helping him. One
                    guy who was helping him in this gold scam had already been drafted, his head had
                    been shaved and he was already doing time in the military system. Now he was
                    getting slammed by the civilian court. I wrote all this up. It was the first
                    time I had been to a real criminal trial with real political overtones.</p>
                <p>The interesting part was that they were all Russians but they were scamming the
                    Uzbeks, they were shaving the gold out of the Uzbek mouths not the Russian
                    mouths. There was a lot of hard feelings against the Russians that I picked up
                    by talking with the Uzbeks while walking around the street. This was because
                    there was an earthquake in Tashkent a few years previously and the Russians had
                    rebuilt their part of the city but the Uzbek part still looked like hell, and
                    you could see the fault line through the city.</p>
                <p>The Uzbeks were very bitter about this. I remember one guy, I was buying papers
                    from him in the underground that went under the main street, and he said to me,
                    “I am really curious about you.” Now he is speaking his second or third-hand
                    Russian, he probably had a dialect before Uzbek, and I was speaking my Russian
                    which he could tell was foreign. “I think I finally know who you are.” I was
                    absolutely amazed. “I talked about it with my friends,” and he looked around at
                    some people there, “you are very tall [because I am over 6'5”] so you can't be
                    one of them [meaning Russians] but you are very dark, so now we know. You are
                    Lithuanian, aren't you?” I said, and I was always very honest with people
                    because I never knew when I was looking at a setup or a provocation, “No, I am
                    an American, a United States citizen.” And I always told people I lived in New
                    York City because that is the one city in America that they know; I told him I
                    was born in New York. I want to tell you, they never stopped talking about that
                    and from then on every time I would come around their shops in the underground
                    they would salute me and say, “American.” They would stand up. They thought it
                    was great that an American was down there. I'll never forget that statement,
                    “You're tall and dark so you're not one of them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Llewellyn Thompson and how he ran the Embassy
                        and how he dealt with things from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>FRY: When I first was on the Soviet desk and studying Russian, Foy Kohler was the
                    Ambassador. Ambassador Thompson had been brought back to the United States
                    in1962 and was President Kennedy's advisor. He gave him that wonderful advice in
                    the Cuban missile crisis when the President had received two letters from
                    Khrushchev. He said, “What you do is don't pay any attention to the second one.
                    Just pretend like you didn't get it.” That seems to have been one of the factors
                    in breaking the problem down to a manageable solution. He was considered a very
                    good advisor and his office was in the State Department. I used to take
                    Memoranda of Conversations for him and had gotten to know him a bit. He knew
                    that I was going to go out there. He was a great gentleman, soft spoken, kind. I
                    was very concerned about his chain smoking. He was one of the few people I have
                    known who simply never had a cigarette out of his mouth or his hand. I mention
                    that because as you know he died of lung and throat cancer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1964 was the year when the famous Surgeon General's report
                        came out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: That's right. The Ambassador then in Moscow was Foy Kohler; he had been
                    there since late 1962. I had also met him in Washington. All those Ambassadors
                    took a great interest in the junior officers coming out because they knew that
                    the junior officers were the real backbone of a lot of the work, particularly in
                    the consular office where we were all basically junior officers, FSO-fives or
                    lower. I was a six by that time and then I was promoted to five while I was
                    there to be consul. They paid attention to what you said and gave you advice.
                    Ambassador Thompson, for example, was interested in the fact—more than just
                    saying, “Oh,”—that my first post had been Trieste. I said, “Of course, your name
                    is so well known there.” I didn't say revered, but the Italians were damn glad
                    that he pulled their chestnuts out of the fire in the Trieste agreement.
                    Thompson was very pleased at that.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>When I went to Moscow, Foy Kohler was there. The very first week Foy Kohler and
                    Phyllis Kohler had my wife and me and all the new officers who had just arrived,
                    over to the residence. Now sure, Ambassadors do this all the time. We had a very
                    nice long chat. Then three weeks or so after I had started working in the
                    consular section, I looked out into the waiting room and there was Foy Kohler
                    talking to my wife. She took him into the library and showed him some things
                    they were doing and then he walked across to the consular section. The Russian
                    employees practically fainted; they said, “He rarely comes down here; this is
                    just amazing.” He came in and we showed him a few things in the consular
                    section. He joked that the consul's office was actually bigger in square footage
                    than the cramped Ambassador's office up on the seventh floor where it was all
                    under surveillance with Marine Guards. We didn't have Marines downstairs since
                    we had Russians working with us and a lot of Russians in the waiting room. He
                    did make the effort to come down and see you in your job. It did wonders for
                    your morale, and at staff meetings he always went around and listened equally to
                    each officer and gave you the impression that he was interested. If you wrote a
                    telegram or an airgram that he thought was good he might even mention it. He
                    would see you upstairs and say, “That was a nice piece on the (such and such),”
                    or, “Your trip report on Kishinev to see that dying American was quite nice;
                    that will save the State Department from any questions from the family as to
                    what actually happened.”</p>
                <p>As it turned out, Foy Kohler went back to be, I believe, Assistant Secretary for
                    European Affairs, and Llewellyn Thompson came back out as Ambassador. He was
                    there at the time that I left and gave me a signed photograph. We got to know
                    him; my wife was a very lovely and charming person, good natured and a good
                    morale builder, and he appreciated that in the Embassy. So I think in that sense
                    he was a very good morale builder. I also think that some of the senior officers
                    were pretty hard task masters because they didn't want you to start feeling
                    sorry for yourself because you got harassed by somebody in the street or were
                    the subject of a provocation or your wife was unhappy. But at the same time you
                    learned so much about speed drafting and speed reading, particularly the guys in
                    the political section, for example. The pressure was always on, and it was a
                    very high pressure Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>But I learned something then that I found discussed in the management courses
                    that I took later on in my Foreign Service career: there is no such thing as a
                    stressful job. There are only people who are stressed. (This doesn't really help
                    you much if you are stressed.) But what I found was that if you break your job
                    down into what is precisely the most important thing that has to move at that
                    moment—that was my Foreign Service lesson there—that is when a lot of the stress
                    goes away. Although you might have to come in on a weekend or a night, the
                    principal fact or information that Washington needed to know had gone, and in a
                    high stress for information flow post that is what you did. It sharpened my
                    priorities which kept me in good stead for the rest of my career because I knew
                    the tendency was to do the easy part first and then ponder how to do the hard
                    part. That was doing it exactly the wrong way when we were on the ramparts out
                    there. Washington wanted it, wanted it fast, and didn't want any excuses when
                    that Assistant Secretary sat down at his desk—and we had that eight-hour
                    turnaround so sometimes it was a little hard; they were going home to sleep when
                    our day was starting. That is why people stayed after hours and just got those
                    telegrams out. There were superb language officers like William Brown, who was
                    Ambassador to Thailand and Israel, and many other language officers who become
                    Chiefs of Mission; Allen Davis, Bill Price, Norm Anderson, Bill Dyess, Bob
                    Barry, Bill Farrand, Tom Niles. There was a very solid corps of officers; not a
                    turkey among them as we used to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 24th of October, 1995 so we just finished a
                        two year gap in this. Let's move to Oslo where you were from 1968 to 1971.
                        What was your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: My job was the second American in the economic section. There was also a
                    commercial counselor and three or four local employees because America had a
                    surprising then - and I guess still now - amount of trade. At the time I arrived
                    in 1968, the ferment on the economic scene in Norway was the oil picture. The
                    test well drilling in the North Sea had been going on for several years. In 1969
                    a field being tested by Phillips Petroleum called Echo Fisk, way out in the
                    North Sea in the Norwegian sector, brought in oil that was so pure that we could
                    bring it into the embassy as part of a demonstration and put a match to it and
                    it would burn like whale oil. The scientists told us that in certain kinds of
                    cars that were not too fancy you could put this oil in directly.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>So it was a very, very high quality oil. And that really set the tone for the
                    work that I was doing there from 1969 to 1971. My specific jobs were, I guess,
                    the usual thing for a mid-career officer in economic work. I was given certain
                    sectors of the economy which were actually the important sectors: shipping and
                    timber. Shipping was for Norway a very important sector of the economy, with
                    Norway having one of the largest merchant fleets in the world. And a very closed
                    shop: most of those companies were owned individually or had a few shares and
                    were very tightly held in Scandinavia, and Norway. It was awhile before this
                    young Foreign Service officer was able to gain their confidence. I was the
                    control officer several times for Helen Bentley, who was at that time the head
                    of the Maritime Commission, and who used to come over to Norway to compare notes
                    on legislation that was pending in the United States, and meet with all
                    Norwegians in the shipping field. My memoranda of conversation took days to
                    collate and prepare. Bentley later became a congresswoman.</p>
                <p>Over time I think I got the ability to call a major shipowner and simply say I
                    have a question which has been posed to me, or our Department of Commerce has a
                    question and could I come in and talk to someone. Surprisingly enough it was
                    usually the owner. It wasn't a matter of being foisted off.</p>
                <p>There were interesting sidelights. For example, we had a Vice-Presidential visit
                    by lame duck Vice-President Hubert Humphrey in 1969. Hubert Humphrey's mother
                    was from Norway and he had wanted to come over for a long time. He may have been
                    there privately but he came to the funeral of Trygve Lie who was the first
                    Secretary General of the United Nations. It was quite a funeral to say the
                    least. That was the first time that I had the opportunity to be a control
                    officer for a delegation which included President Truman's daughter, Margaret
                    Truman, and other dignitaries. But since it was not politically oriented, it was
                    more or less - to the extent a funeral can be - a fun opportunity, it taught me
                    a lot about dealing with people who traveled on official visits for the United
                    States Government at that rank. There were many, many official visitors to
                    Norway. In the area of NATO, for example, they usually wanted an economic
                    briefing and I usually did those. So I got to know a lot of the people who were
                    dealing in NATO political-military affairs, which I must say later on, when I
                    was stationed in the Operations Center, helped me quite a bit in knowing
                    important players.</p>
                <p>There was another sidelight which was fascinating. Most people associate the
                    Nobel Prize with Sweden and rightly so since all but the Peace Prize are decided
                    by a committee of the Swedish Parliament, and the awards are made by the King of
                    Sweden in Stockholm. The Peace Prize is decided by a Norwegian parliamentary
                    committee and the presentation is made in Oslo by a member of parliament. It's a
                    prerogative that they esteem very highly and the Nobel Peace Prize, as you can
                    imagine, is one of the heavy weight awards of all time.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In 1970, the award was given to Norman Borlaug, who was then - is now, the father
                    of the green revolution. Working through the Rockefeller Institute, particularly
                    in Mexico and other places in the world, he was able to create yields of rice
                    and corn and other crops which, given the same area of space and climatic
                    conditions, would be able to yield three or four or times as much as the
                    previous crops had been yielding. He brought with him not only his family and
                    friends, and the President of the University of Minnesota - because he was a
                    Minnesotan - but he brought from Mexico the field hands: that is the
                    Spanish-speaking men who had labored for years with him - to the wonderful white
                    tie formal dinner where the workers were rather simply dressed. It was very
                    moving to see his loyalty to them as he pointed out at the dinner that it would
                    have been very difficult for him to achieve success without the dedication over
                    many, many years of the people who actually labored in the fields.</p>
                <p>So that was a very nice touch. I was interested to see recently that the Peace
                    Prize is now in the range of a million dollars. I think Doctor Borlaug, if my
                    memory serves me, got $185,000 which will give you an idea of inflation between
                    1970 and the 1990s. There were other Americans who came on the Peace Prize. The
                    previous one I think I had been Martin Luther King. The International Labor
                    Organization won the Peace Prize and at that time the director was an American
                    so he represented the ILO at that meeting. Also, Ralph Bunche, who was at that
                    time retired, or was at least Emeritus at the UN and a very distinguished
                    American in his own right who had himself won the Peace Prize for his work in
                    the 1940s in Palestine, was a visitor. We were able to entertain him and work
                    with him on some of the things that he wanted to do there. So all in all it was
                    a busy place. Governor Hickel of Alaska was then head of the Interior Department
                    and he came to Norway. He was very interested in the northern countries because
                    of their relationship with Alaska.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your ambassador during that time was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: The ambassador when I went to Norway was Margaret Joy Tibbetts, who was one
                    of the first career women Foreign Service officers to be appointed chief of
                    mission. She was a superb manager, and I often reflect on the fact that my
                    colleague Rozanne Ridgway, who was then the number two in the political section,
                    must have learned a lot from her because next to Ambassador Tibbetts I would say
                    Ambassador Ridgway was without doubt the best manager and the best leader that I
                    ever worked with in the Foreign Service. I think of them in the same breath
                    because they were of the same mold.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Tibbetts left about six or eight months after I got there and the next ambassador
                    we waited for with some trepidation, I guess. He was a political appointee named
                    Phillip Kingsland Crowe. He was 100 percent political and very proud of it. He
                    had been Ambassador to South Africa, and Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. He was a good
                    friend of Secretary Dulles and so on. His wife was the heir to US Shoe, a vast
                    manufacturer of many products and headquartered in Saint Louis. He used to laugh
                    that every time there was an election, or Senator Fulbright was running, or
                    however the land lay in the election period, his wife who was a democrat, and he
                    used to split their donations. So he used to joke that when he went into the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his ambassadorial hearings it used to be,
                    “Hi Phil. When are you leaving?”</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact he turned out to be a fascinating person, a very decent human
                    being. His main interest was in world wildlife. He was a founder of the World
                    Wildlife Fund with Prince Phillip and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. He had
                    been a big game hunter and the whole nine yards when it came to killing animals
                    and then he realized worldwide what was happening and wrote a book called The
                    Empty Ark and got very much involved in wildlife rehabilitation and rescue.</p>
                <p>I sometimes wonder if my own interest in wildlife and work which I have done
                    since leaving the Foreign Service was not at least spurred by Crowe.</p>
                <p>I was the only guy in the embassy at that time who had a boat. I had a 28'
                    inboard diesel fishing boat and he loved to go out and take photographs. The
                    first day he was there he asked, “who has a boat” and they said, “Well, Fry has
                    a boat” and they said take the ambassador out on the weekend. So my wife and I
                    did so and became quite good friends with him. I was concerned that people would
                    wonder why he did so on the first day when he didn't know anybody else in the
                    embassy. At the first staff meeting, he was calling me Sam. I traveled with him
                    a great deal. One of the great experiences of my life was in 1970, not too long
                    after his arrival; about a year.</p>
                <p>We decided to show the flag in the Norwegian Island of Svalbard, sometimes called
                    Spitsbergen, which since 1925 was under international treaty but under Norwegian
                    sovereignty. A number of nations are equal signatories to the Svalbard Treaty,
                    which mainly concerned demilitarization of the first and only area in the
                    northern hemisphere, and which remained so all during the Cold War. During World
                    War II there was a breach with a small German party that tried to set up, as
                    they tried to do in Greenland, a weather station. They didn't send troops or try
                    to occupy it, but it did lead to a British commando raid with loss of life. But
                    with that exception all during the Cold War, which I'll mention a bit more
                    later, it was a demilitarized zone. Norway turned it into a peaceable kingdom.
                    Hunting was restricted and only once did they get into the business of allowing
                    some test well to be drilled for oil. Oil turned out to be nonexistent and it
                    remains as it was, although more modernized than when we went there.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Svalbard has been of interest to the United States because the capital city, if
                    you want to call it that, is called Longyear City. John Longyear was an American
                    venture capitalist who bought out a coal claim in the beginning of the 1900s.
                    During the First World War, Longyear left that venture and America had no more
                    economic interests there, but we did have an interest in the settlement of the
                    issue of Svalbard which was the only territory by the 1920's which was
                    technically called in international law a “no man's” land. We were very
                    concerned along with other Europeans that something would develop up there that
                    would not be favorable for the world community, which led to the Svalbard
                    Treaty. With equal right to go up there, no American ambassador - if my memory
                    is correct - had been there since at least the 1950's. The Russians had gone in
                    quite strongly with equal rights. They had then two coal cities with a
                    population of 1500 or 2000.</p>
                <p>So Ambassador Crowe decided to go up and show the flag and that we did. We went
                    up on a ship that makes a one-day stop there. But we stayed for ten or twelve
                    days with the governor general. He took us on his boat all the way up as far as
                    you could go to the pack ice, up to a little island called Moffen, where we saw
                    for example - no one had been up there for many years - the first walrus pup
                    seem in decades. Which meant that the walrus were beginning to come back. Until
                    the treaty was signed and well into the 1930's, all wildlife had been virtually
                    exterminated up there by unregulated hunting. Muskoxen were reintroduced later
                    on, and now it has more of a normal appearance with wildlife.</p>
                <p>We scoured the islands. We visited all of the sights. We did not visit the
                    Russian encampments because the Norwegians felt that it would be a bit
                    complicated. Originally we had asked the Russian Ambassador to come with us.
                    Right up to the last moment he was going to do so, so that he could visit his
                    Russian sites while we would take him to the Norwegian sites. But at the last
                    moment, of course, he bailed out. It seemed a bit much for us to push our rights
                    too far. In any case we took the Governor General's boat into the Russian harbor
                    and through the “graphics program” for which another agency allowed us to use a
                    very fine camera and all the film we wanted, I took dozens and dozens of
                    telephoto shots of the whole area as we cruised up and down from about 75 yards
                    off shore on the Governor's boat with no Russian able to say anything. I think
                    during my stay in Svalbard I took about 400 shots. They were the first on the
                    ground, detailed, top-to-bottom ones of every inhabited location that had been
                    done other than what would have been done by U-2 or something like that. So we
                    really brought everybody up to date in Washington on what was being done
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I had the pleasure of doing a very long airgram about the trip, with the
                    Ambassador contributing a great deal. It turned out to be some 30 or 40 pages.
                    Subsequently in the mid-'70s, there was a great to do when the Norwegians wanted
                    to build an airport in Svalbard and the Russians said, “Oh, if you have an
                    airport then we'll build a helicopter pad.” It went bouncing around NATO. The
                    airport was built and of course it was not military. It was built so that
                    supplies could be brought in during the winter time when the ice pack surrounded
                    the island. I was told by the Norwegian Desk Officer later that when the word
                    went out for an NSC task force on Svalbard they said give us everything you
                    have. All they had was my airgram.</p>
                <p>NATO had acquiesced to Norway's and Denmark's firm commitment to not having any
                    nuclear weapons on Norwegian soil except in time of war. However, the northern
                    wing of the NATO Air Command was in a bunker right outside of Oslo. I had an
                    opportunity to go in there a number of times. And that was real Cold War stuff
                    with star wars. Everything was underground. I don't know what would happen as
                    time went on with a direct hit, but it was pretty impressive. It showed that
                    Norway, for all its occasional Labor party desires to pull back or reduce its
                    contribution to NATO, believe me was a full participant. Also, both under the
                    economic hat and just kind of wandering around as an embassy officer I got
                    permission to go into the Norwegian naval installations on the west coast in
                    which tunnels could swallow up a very large frigate, what we would call a small
                    destroyer, in about five minutes into a mountain.</p>
                <p>No wonder the Germans coveted those fjords during the war. I visited all of their
                    steel plants, their aluminum sites that were very important to us because of
                    world competition and aluminum prices. On fisheries I visited Norwegian
                    fishingports of every size; Christiansand, Trondheim, Bergen, and up to Tromso,
                    the northern most city in the world. In general, I would say I had the real fun
                    and pleasure of visiting everything you could think of in Norway that was in any
                    way of economic interest to the United States. It was a very, very satisfying
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the “Soviet threat” at that time? We're
                        talking about 1968 to 1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>FRY: Very seriously. For those who were invited to Munich to play war games,
                    which I never was, I know that one of the major games was the penetration of the
                    north of Norway by a Soviet task force. The scenario started out with, “all we
                    want is a little more buffer between Murmansk and the Kola peninsula and NATO,
                    and all we want is 1000 square miles. We don't want to go to war with this.” How
                    would NATO take the bait or would NATO stand by its commitment that one inch of
                    NATO soil was the same as the United States? There was a great deal of concern.
                    It led to the establishment at that time - but not to the degree that it later
                    became - a so-called prepositioning in which large quantities of equipment and
                    supplies: food, winter clothing, and weapons; were prepositioned in Norway for a
                    US Marine brigade. When the first Marines were there it led to a political
                    crisis in the Norwegian Parliament about having foreign troops actually
                    exercising on Norwegian territory. It wasn't anywhere near the Russian border;
                    it was down near the middle of Norway where the ports were. But of course, the
                    Russians went bananas and communist parties all over Scandinavia had a joy-ride
                    with this since Sweden and Finland were neutral. So here was a country which
                    curled up into the Arctic Ocean and bordered the Soviet Union and it was having
                    NATO maneuvers. You see, it was the only NATO country that could do that except
                    for Turkey and we weren't up in the mountains of Turkey.</p>
                <p>So yes, the Soviet threat was taken very seriously and the work that our
                    political section did on the NATO issue was clearly the major political issue
                    that we had. The major economic issue, interestingly enough, was whether Norway
                    would, at some point, join the European Community. Shortly after I left it
                    decided not to do. There was an alternate form in the European Free Trade
                    Association, EFTA, that the Finns were negotiating with the other Nordic
                    countries. Those negotiations took forever and we in the economic section did
                    all the reporting on that. That was of interest to us because the relationship
                    that Norway would have with Finland - and Finland with the rest of Scandinavia -
                    was a bit dicier than it later became. You figure in the '60s and the '70s the
                    Cold War was really at its height and people were settling in for the long haul.
                    Where Finland stood and what might be the scenario for Sweden was, if not
                    crucial, of great interest to our planners. Any relationship that brought
                    Finland closer to the west was viewed with great interest by us, and I might say
                    with some concern by the Soviet Union. So that linkage between the economic and
                    the NATO military was always present in any Norwegian equation that you wanted
                    to talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Norwegian political scene as far as
                        NATO, United States, Soviet Union, communists and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>FRY: The NATO connection was strong and when pressed, even the leftist Labor
                    Party, which in fact was in power a substantial part of the time when I was
                    there went short of wanting to leave NATO. There were members on the left of the
                    ruling coalition headed by the Social Democratic or Labor Party, who did want to
                    pull out of NATO. And then there was a small Communist Party. But all of the
                    other parties and a majority of the Labor Party definitely wanted to remain.
                    They couldn't see a role for Norway which was the equivalent of the role that
                    Sweden or Finland were taking. So the answer was in reality, the NATO connection
                    was never in doubt but everybody loved to play with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Sweden? I mean, what was the outlook of the
                        Sweden you saw?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Sweden and Norway have had this wonderful love-hate relationship partly
                    because Norway did not become an independent country until 1905 when it split
                    from Sweden. That's why I mention the Nobel Peace Prize being there. Gustav
                    Nobel built a beautiful home in Oslo because he had a lot of factories over
                    there. It wasn't his primary residence but you'd think it was. His daughter
                    married a Norwegian and lived there. The street around his house was later named
                    Nobel's Gate. His residence became the residence of the American ambassador. So
                    we had a connection to Nobel other than the prizes.</p>
                <p>There was the usual banter, for example, about the dumbest Norwegian that moved
                    to Sweden and raised the IQ of both countries. All kinds of Norwegian jokes like
                    that. The reality was that the relationship was very close. If there was
                    residual slight bitterness about the Swedish role during the Second World War,
                    you would never really notice it. Sweden also played a great role in WW II
                    taking people in from Finland and Norway. So it was just an historical kind of
                    banter back and forth, but the economic relationship was very strong because as
                    it developed in the '60s and '70s, there was a free market in labor in
                    Scandinavia where many thousands of Norwegians were working in Swedish factories
                    and also Finns working in Sweden. So they are all a band of brothers; they are
                    all Nordics, and they all stick together. They had SAS, the unified airline
                    between Sweden Denmark and Norway. They cooperated totally in the UN. They
                    cooperated on all issues dealing with shipping and seamen and many other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when the Nixon administration came in. We
                        were still heavily engaged in Vietnam, the Swedes - particularly Olaf Palme
                        - was vehemently against us. We saw Sweden basically as the enemy almost.
                        How about Norway... from your perspective, how did you see the
                        Norwegians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>FRY: The anti-US in Vietnam demonstrations and feelings in Norway ran high. At
                    the university it was, you might say, universal. There were conservatives in the
                    younger set in the political parties that stood by - if you want to use that
                    term - the commitment that we had made in Vietnam. But in general it was looked
                    at with outright disgust and horror, replete with many marches past the embassy,
                    I might add. There was great concern about what the United States was doing, the
                    image it was creating. In the mildest from, as I suppose in many other
                    countries, the Conservative Party was kind of a shaking its head - what was our
                    goal there; where were we going to go? So I would say we tried to make the sale.
                    We had the usual people coming through: Douglas Pike and company from USIA
                    trying to make the sale on why it was important to be in Vietnam. Certainly the
                    Norwegians never criticized us officially or at the government level, but it was
                    very, very unpopular.</p>
                <p>One example was when Vice President Hubert Humphrey came to the funeral of the
                    first UN Secretary General, Trygve Lie. There was a large park across the street
                    from the embassy which was an extension of the park that was the king's palace.
                    It was a park you could just walk through and it wasn't particularly patrolled.
                    There were policemen in front of our embassy; they were worried about
                    demonstrators. But just about two hours before Humphrey arrived, persons - I
                    think eventually identified - got giant slingshots and fired ball bearings from
                    across the street into the embassy front. They went through triple pane glass.
                    Since the embassy, which had been built by the Finnish architect Sarrinen, was a
                    unique building; everything had been made just for that building and there were
                    no spare parts. We could not replace the windows. There was glass everywhere and
                    it could have been serious; the bearings came through almost like bullets and
                    there were a number of windows broken.</p>
                <p>The Vice President handled it beautifully. In fact when he came to the embassy,
                    it was to say hello to the folks but it was not a visit for the embassy, it was
                    a visit for a funeral so he was not out gallivanting around. That was the kind
                    of thing you got. After that we had a heavy police patrol. This was the first,
                    and I believe we were the only embassy that had to have that kind of heavy
                    coverage. It made us all a little uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry used this attack in a way that
                    showed Norwegians being so sensible and so practical about money and about their
                    affairs. They turned it on the left by simply pointing out in the paper in
                    several long articles exactly what it cost the Norwegian people to replace the
                    windows and other damage to the American Embassy. They said every Norwegian had
                    to pay so much money and wasn't that a silly way to spend your tax money. They
                    tried to put the shame to all sides; “that's not the way real Norwegians
                    behave.” Signs and things were pasted on the side of the embassy wall when the
                    policeman wasn't looking. But to sum it up, Vietnam, as in many posts, was a
                    time of, if not of outright hostility, then of great questioning by an ally that
                    wanted nothing more than a close friendship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we move on to your next job which was the
                        Operations Center. I've got you serving from 1971 to 1974? That's a long
                        haul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, yes. It was an assignment that grew like Topsy. If I had to separate
                    out one assignment in my 30 years that covered the waterfront this would be it
                    for the shear input of knowledge about what was going on in the world and how
                    the State Department operated. I guess I reached the point where I thought that
                    my head was going to burst and others had had that feeling up there.</p>
                <p>What happened was the inspectors, in their wisdom in the fall of 1970, came
                    through Oslo and decided that from their point of view oil was flowing in, the
                    Norwegian economy was going to change and so on, and that we really didn't need
                    three American economic officers. What we needed was more economic reporting by
                    the Foreign Service nationals. We needed a commercial officer and then one
                    American, the chief of section, who would do the economic reporting that was
                    classified. You didn't need this mid-career 05 or whatever it was position. So
                    the upshot was my position was abolished. When they asked me about it I said,
                    “Well, abolish away. I suppose if you don't want as much reporting and you don't
                    want as much travel then that's what you'll get.” But I said I had a feeling
                    that Norway was going to play a much more active international economic role
                    when oil starts flowing in, both through the UN or economic organizations. Its
                    going to have a lot more money and be able to play more of a role
                    internationally. In fact, that's exactly what happened. After four years they
                    put another American back in the same position I had. This is nothing new to
                    Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The Operations Center was always looking for mid-career officers to serve as the
                    senior watch officers. A watch team was then three. I won't even purport to know
                    what has happened to the Operations Center since I was there. It's a revolution
                    of electronic wonders since those days. When I started out in 1971, the word was
                    that this was the “heart” of the State Department. It was, in fact, a small room
                    with a modest telephone system, tucked away on the 7th floor. Lots of teletypes
                    and TV and radio, but not anything approaching state-of-the-art. President
                    Kennedy had authorized the Ops Center to begin work after the Cuban Missile
                    Crisis, building a more alert and viable system than had been setup after the
                    Bay of Pigs. That's when it really got started. What was the heart and soul of
                    the system was no more than a couple of desks and teletypes. We weren't even
                    connected to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But it was pretty jazzy
                    compared to not having anything. The main construction while I was there was
                    building what was called the modern Operations Center. There are very large
                    areas for task forces to work in during critical times. There is a very large
                    and classified meeting room with all wonderful buttons that brought down maps
                    and had all kinds of audiovisual things; and a very modern Operations Center
                    which is still the room that is used even in 1995. In 1973 the new phone panels
                    tripled the capacity that we had had. We began to have drop lines to every major
                    agency in Washington, where you press a button and you are onto CIA, the White
                    House, and the military command center at the Pentagon. You began to have
                    exchanges on a monthly basis with officers who worked in other centers and a
                    much closer, more efficient and therefore more successful interaction between
                    all the operations centers in the city. So it really was a giant step
                    forward.</p>
                <p>That assignment was supposed to last, I think, a year or eighteen months. Since I
                    had been out of the United States, for five and a half years - close to six
                    years - I thought that I would stay in the Operations Center for a year or so
                    and then move on to something else in the European bureau.</p>
                <p>Well, what happened was I enjoyed the work and I enjoyed the people in the
                    Secretariat. I enjoyed working up there. And when the time came to think about
                    an assignment, I was asked by Ted Eliot, who was then the Executive Secretary of
                    the State Department, if I would consider staying on and being the deputy in the
                    Operations Center. The deputy's job was basically preparing the Morning Summary
                    for the Secretary of State. It was prepared on the watch but you'd be
                    responsible for it. And then there was a magazine that was called Foreign
                    Affairs or something like that. It was a classified magazine that was sent out
                    once a week to all posts. It seems so archaic now, the way we put it together
                    was snipping out a picture from Time magazine and going though our own morgue
                    and getting reports from bureaus. It was classified “secret” but basically it
                    was everything you were reading in the newspaper. We were not allowed to put in
                    anything that was really sexy or sensitive which later we were able to do. I
                    worked in that deputy job and also filled in on the watch for about a year. I
                    had bought a house in Washington and I was perfectly content to stay there and
                    not worry about moving out of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>So the same thing happened again. Ted Eliot was still there and William Rogers
                    was still Secretary of State - and they asked if I would like to stay and be
                    Director of the Operations Center, and that would have made the three years.
                    Well, I said yes. I knew the ropes and I knew how the Secretariat functioned. So
                    in June 1973 I took over after a nice vacation. Then Mr. Rogers left and Dr.
                    Kissinger became Secretary of State. I want to tell you that from the moment it
                    was announced that Kissinger would be both the President's National Security
                    Advisor and retain that hat and be Secretary of State, nothing was the same. The
                    Operations Center and the Secretariat in general were the focal point of the
                    fulcrum for all of the changes of the Kissinger revolution in managing the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>I can honestly say it was not just hectic, it was mind-boggling to adjust to the
                    demands that he was making. There were demands that were being made on all parts
                    of the State Department. But the main thing was the speed of information flow,
                    Kissinger used FLASH- designated telegrams to people who would normally have
                    gotten priority. FLASH, a war-situation precedence, was virtually never used and
                    he was using it constantly. It was that kind of speed up of “where is it? where
                    is it?” For example, one night I was getting ready to leave and without warning
                    I saw Secretary Kissinger and his then top assistant, Larry Eagleburger, who in
                    fact later became Secretary of State through many permutations, wandering down
                    the hall toward the Operations Center. I said, “Good evening Mr. Secretary.” He
                    had never been in the Operations Center. This was four or five months after he
                    had arrived. And he said, “Show me around.”</p>
                <p>So I did and I explained what was going on. His attention span for this kind of
                    thing was pretty short. I took him into the room where the compartmentalized or
                    highly sensitive coded information was coming in for the Bureau of Intelligence
                    and Research, which we weren't allowed to touch, and where the anchor end of the
                    hotline to the Soviet Union to Moscow was located. In fact, the real anchor end
                    was located in the Pentagon War Room, but there was a transmission line which
                    could go from the Defense Department to State directly. It even played out
                    day-after-day-after-day, the tests every hour that people were doing - the
                    Russians and the Americans. So he said, “So if I want to send a message all I do
                    is come here and you send it to Moscow?” And I had to explain that we couldn't
                    transmit; it was only a receiving station; that he would have to go over - or
                    however he wanted to work it - to the Pentagon and that was that.</p>
                <p>He looked at Eagleburger and gave Eagleburger a scowling look and said, “Call
                    General Such-and-such.” I don't know who the general was but I know he ran the
                    hotline over there and I want to tell you that although we couldn't get money
                    for other things, in about three weeks we had completely changed the terminal
                    end of the hotline. The team that managed it of course still stayed in the
                    Pentagon War Room. But if circumstances demanded, we could actually put a
                    teletype - it was archaic by today's standards — almost directly to the
                    Kremlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The upshot of the conversion about this little teletype circuit was that
                    Kissinger would send a message, without leaving the State Department, to the
                    Pentagon on their system where it would then be translated or whatever had to be
                    done, and be put on the main system to Moscow. But there were many other
                    innovations that he required.</p>
                <p>It helped us a great deal because it led to an upgrade of telephonic
                    communications and other things that he required. When he traveled - even up to
                    New York for one night and had his room in a hotel — the phone team spent about
                    two days before he got there putting exactly the phones that he wanted, where he
                    wanted them, in which room. I mean, he was never without massive communications
                    support, dwarfing anything that Secretary Rogers had asked for. And that led to
                    a lot of people using the Operations Center for calls to be connected to
                    Kissinger that were not on the classified lines. We began to be and then became
                    a much more integral part of the Secretary's team because we were constantly
                    phone patching members of his immediate entourage and other senior officers in
                    the State Department. The telephone switchboard really came of age, and lest
                    anyone consider that the Foreign Service officers then were just telephone
                    operators, let me tell you that the conversations were wonderful to hear. We of
                    course - while we were not supposed to be listening - simply turned up the
                    speaker and had the pleasure of not being on the line but hearing what was
                    said.</p>
                <p>I might add that the Secretary's staff was monitoring and recording all of his
                    calls at that time, as was well known. They were used in his memoirs. Anything
                    that went through his office was monitored and written up whether it went
                    through the Operations Center or not. But the Operations Center had the ability
                    to tape. At that time, unless it was some specific kind of inter- governmental
                    call, if it was an outsider then the beep went on every 30 seconds and you had
                    to say it fast or however the formula was that the caller was being taped. The
                    briefing books that were done for his travels were quite different: much more
                    elaborate and more highly classified than they had been for other secretaries.
                    So in short, the whole operation in both the Staff Secretariat and the
                    Operations Center became more entwined with the front office of the Secretary
                    and the Deputy Secretary than had ever been the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Well this led, of course, right into the question of Vietnam, which was then at
                    its final agony. As when he was in the White House, this meant NODIS and EXDIS
                    messages - No Distribution meaning that they could not be distributed without
                    prior instruction either from the Secretary of State or the Executive
                    Secretariat. We were flooded with these messages all of the time. It used to be
                    that they were sent up to the front office in locked metal tubes, and waited
                    until morning or until the Executive Secretary or the Deputy Executive Secretary
                    could look at them. It got to the point where they could be spending all day on
                    that. So the senior watch officers in the Ops Center became the people who
                    opened the tubes, sorted the messages, and by prearranged instruction made the
                    distributions ready for morning. It sounds like a modest revolution in terms of
                    information flow but some of the code word messages would go only to the
                    Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, and let's say the Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs - period! Not to the assistant secretaries, not to the other principals
                    on the 7th floor. The only other people who would see them were the FSO-3
                    officers in the Operations Center. It was quite a step up, and consequently we
                    were brought into meetings where it was explained what was expected on the
                    weekend and who to call. They didn't even commit to paper. They said if
                    “such-and-such” comes in then the Watch will only call this person and will
                    simply say your presence is required at the State Department. That's all that
                    person needed to know. It gave you a real sense of participating.</p>
                <p>We refined our measures and mastered all the new equipment, which was a fortunate
                    thing because in October of 1973, with Kissinger barely in his seat, and a lot
                    of reforms and changes that he instituted coming into play, he went up to New
                    York on a weekend. I and FSO Peter Sarros became very concerned about messages
                    that we had been seeing for a week or more about the Middle East. I got so
                    concerned on my watch that I called the duty officer in NEA and then spoke with
                    the NEA deputy assistant secretary. I sort of got the “yes, well we know about
                    that - you don't have to worry about that - and you just do your job and we're
                    following the Middle East” kind of thing. It finally reached the point with me,
                    as I was about to go off duty at midnight, that I called the Executive Secretary
                    and in oblique terms told him what my concerns were. He said he understood and
                    would call whoever dealt with this in the intelligence community. This was Tom
                    Pickering who was then the Executive Secretary. He called me back because I was
                    going off and he said, “Well, just keep your eye on things.” In effect, I said,
                    “I've been here over two years and this is the first time that I've ever had a
                    gut feeling that somehow these messages are really telling us something that we
                    are not sensing. I can't put my finger on it but that's the way it is.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The Arabs attacked Israel to begin the 1973 war the next morning. I don't claim
                    any prescience on it; a lot of other people had this feeling but what can you do
                    if you don't have the hard information. The Israelis were caught by surprise
                    too. But I can tell you that after two years of training yourself on messages it
                    didn't make you dull, it made you sharper to tone and nuance. I was absolutely
                    convinced that night when I went home - and so were other watch officers I might
                    add - that there was something going on that we hadn't seen before. I remember
                    that my mother had just come down to Washington to visit. The war started on
                    October 6, 1973, the Jewish Day of Atonement. I never saw my mother again on
                    that visit of one week except to say good-bye. Two years later she was dead as
                    the end result of a mugging in Buffalo, New York. I have always thought of how
                    work took over her last visit with me. I went to the Ops Center and I think I
                    went home probably the next Tuesday, with my wife bringing me some clean shirts.
                    There were task forces beyond belief. We went to whatever the alert status was
                    that was practically ready to launch. Defcon four or something like that. I mean
                    guys were called back from leave; it was a real dicey period. Then the message
                    came in that the Soviet airborne army in the famed Odessa district was getting
                    ready to board planes. That's when war talk actually started going on. The whole
                    relationship with the War room over in the Pentagon was not “Hi, Sam - How's it
                    going over there?” We filled massive briefing books by the moment for the
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>The reason I mention this was not the war story but a very practical outcome to
                    an event that changed the way the State Department did communications and
                    certainly changed the way the Secretary did. Everyone always had the feeling
                    that if you sent a high transmission speed message, that is to say an immediate
                    or FLASH message, that it would get there faster. But what all of the people who
                    dealt in the system knew was that there was an infinite line of messages. All
                    you did with the FLASH message was to go to the head of the cue of the next
                    speed of messages and so on down the line. With every FLASH message, everything
                    else got pushed back one. If you sent two FLASH messages that went from the
                    State Department to Athens and on to the Middle East, one of them had to be
                    second. If you sent ten, one of them had to be tenth. The briefings that we used
                    to give, that a flash message should be some place from the time it left our
                    hands to the time it was received in under three minutes, of course, was thrown
                    onto a cocked hat.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Well, there was an exchange that Kissinger was trying to have with King Hussein
                    in Jordan. A message took about 25 minutes and I want to tell you that when
                    Kissinger blew his stack you could feel it all the way down the hall and through
                    the walls. He simply thought every one was betraying him with what was going on,
                    and “why couldn't these people do their jobs.” Later, it was a matter of a
                    massive task examining what happened to our communications in the beginning of
                    the Middle East war in 1973. What had happened was that every area commander or
                    military attach� in the Middle East, and from central Europe all the way down to
                    Egypt, were sending FLASH messages and then they were doing FLASH override.
                    FLASH messages were put into a queue. The FLASH override might say, “there are
                    Turkish tanks moving out of Ismir” or God knows what that had nothing to do with
                    the transmission of diplomatic information. But it was using the same electronic
                    system. That's what the higher ups could never quite understand. It wasn't that
                    the State Department had its own transmission system. The Diplomatic
                    Telecommunications System (DTS) is managed by the Central Intelligence Agency
                    and NSA. And that's the truth of the matter. It's not that they were putting
                    their messages first or anybody else's. The computer had queues of FLASH
                    messages - at one point I think it was 300 or 400. I can't be quoted on the
                    number but it was absolutely amazing. Therefore, an immediate message was
                    routine.</p>
                <p>This realization completely changed how the DTS was to be managed in a crisis.
                    What the task force found out was that the United States Diplomatic
                    Telecommunications System in the event of an emergency - and we won't even go
                    into the event of a full scale war - was hopelessly inadequate if it was not
                    used properly. Because what was required was absolute communications discipline
                    by everyone. In the case of the Department of State, the use of the precedence
                    FLASH was so strictly controlled that it wasn't a State Department problem. But
                    when you got into the military, when the military was not using the strict
                    military system but was interfacing with attach�s in the diplomatic
                    telecommunications system, then the message of any military officer anywhere had
                    equal weight with Kissinger's message. And Kissinger didn't like that very much.
                    He did not see himself in terms of diplomatic negotiations equated with an
                    assistant naval attach� in Istanbul. He made sure that everyone understood that
                    fact. In fact, we did change all through the system what would happen and who
                    would be able to authorize such messages.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We also, at that time, changed communications procedures between intelligence
                    agencies and operations centers beyond the secure lines using the old type
                    secure telephone where you changed the electronic card everyday. You needed
                    something that was much faster and more sophisticated than that. It led to the
                    introduction of a second classified telephone network between Washington and
                    overseas which really brought us into the age in which we live now. The reason
                    that I mention this is because when I started out in 1971, when people were told
                    “this is the heart of the State Department — we can reach any embassy in the
                    world in a matter of minutes” we'd all shudder because it might be 25 minutes if
                    the satellite was out or whatever. I mean, what happened between 1971 and 1974
                    was absolutely astonishing And even then, even though it was the cutting edge,
                    it would today be looked at like a 1930s Packard next to a modern race car. But
                    the changes were all made by the exigencies and the need for speed. That speed
                    was personified by Secretary Kissinger. Once they were in nobody ever looked
                    back. The Internet between intelligence agencies finally broke down this wall
                    which had existed in the so-called “President's Daily Brief,” which was prepared
                    only by CIA. Kissinger said, “Why can't the State Department have one?” “Why do
                    I have to work at the White House to see this material?” As it turned out in a
                    study that he conducted, which I sat on, that 85% of the President's Daily
                    Brief, aside from the sexy code word messages and things from very controlled
                    sources, 85% of it was Foreign Service reporting. When Kissinger heard this he
                    said that the State Department will have its daily brief. It was at that point
                    in 1974, or the end of 1973, that we integrated highly classified information,
                    which was closely held in the State Department, in with the Secretary's Morning
                    Summary. It more or less began to compete with the President's Daily Brief that
                    the President got directly from CIA. It raised the prestige and the morale of
                    the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the State Department. And then it
                    wasn't “why is the President's Daily Brief from the Agency” it was “why can't I
                    see the Secretary's Morning Summary from the State Department?” I was very glad
                    that I played a role in that. I helped with the negotiations with the
                    intelligence community. Fortunately, it came at a time when both CIA and USIA
                    and others were either starting - in the case of USIA - an operations center, or
                    in the case of the CIA, were completely rebuilding theirs as we had rebuilt
                    ours. I was on the panel that was advising on what we had found that was good,
                    what was bad, how we had begun to shave corners and things that might be of
                    interest to them. In all, it was a very exciting and innovative period. To
                    discuss the actual substance of messages would of course be impossible because
                    you saw so much with five or six teletypes banging away day and night and the
                    message volume growing steadily. In the course of an eight-hour watch I was
                    looking at - for distribution to senior officials, not to the bureaus -
                    something on the range of three or four hundred messages. And it was steadily
                    rising. It was what was called a “growth industry” from 1971 to 1974 and it
                    never looked back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the Pueblo incident which happened
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>FRY: Yes, peripherally. We got involved with the Pueblo mainly as an interested
                    player because the technical part of it, the handling of it, was 100 percent
                    White House and Defense Department, with the Secretary, of course, a major
                    player in the National Security Council. But, no we were not in the sense of
                    other than being a transmitter and distributor of messages. The State
                    Department, as always, had to pick up the pieces around the world wherever they
                    fell, but it was not a State Department show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Kissinger National Security Advisor time before
                        he became Secretary of State, was the feeling of the State Department or the
                        Ops Center that they were sort of playing second string to the national
                        security operation or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, I think that was very much the feeling. The feeling had a good basis in
                    fact. When you consider - I don't know what has been written in modern times -
                    but I know that Secretary Rogers did not know, nor did the Executive Secretary
                    Ted Eliot know, that Kissinger went to China when he went the first time. As a
                    matter of fact, the cover for that was that he was traveling in Pakistan, and we
                    got an EXDIS message from his staff saying that he had an upset stomach and was
                    not able to continue his trip. He needed about 24 to 30 hours to rest and the
                    Pakistani government had very kindly allowed him to use a mountain station in
                    the hills where he could just relax. “Please send the morning summaries to the
                    embassy” and it would bring messages to him. It was jokingly said that he had
                    “delhi-belly” or something like that and no one gave it much thought. A few
                    hours into the second day he was leaving Pakistan and off he went to continue
                    the rest of his trip. I know that no one in the State Department - unless
                    something has come up in really recent times - had any idea that he had done
                    that with Winston Lord and whoever else was with him.</p>
                <p>I'm sure that there must have been some kind of impact on Secretary Rogers. But
                    he was so busy in his own right; I mean he still had all the Secretary things.
                    How he felt personally about being cut out - I have not read his memoirs so I
                    don't know. Yes, the State Department was cut out and there was a lot of talk on
                    that. It wasn't cut out in the sense that Kissinger didn't use its personnel
                    because that led to the same exodus of very top-notch officers being seconded to
                    the National Security Council to the point where Congress kept saying, “who are
                    all these people?” They were on duty over there but they showed on the State
                    roster. So the White House could say that they had not increased the staff of
                    the National Security Council at all when in fact there were something like 60
                    or 70 State people over there. It was replicating all the activities of the
                    bureaus of the State Department. The people who were working over there really
                    felt that they were in the in-system. How much they were doing, privately
                    telling people, I don't know. But if they wanted to keep their job they weren't
                    doing much of that and they weren't doing it in print. So Kissinger was using
                    the State Department a lot and he was using the best and the brightest. Some of
                    the brightest got so upset, as you may recall, well - Mort Halperin wasn't at
                    State but others who were working over there on Vietnam, Bill Watts, for
                    example, resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing with Bill Watts tomorrow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Bill Watts comes immediately to mind because he did resign and he was
                    exactly in that kind of situation. Bill was concerned enough to leave that
                    position. So there was a lot of interplay going on but it wasn't going through
                    Secretary Rogers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question before we move along. What about the
                        personnel of the Operation Center? I know that when I was a supervising
                        officer, I used to tell officers - second, third tour officers - try to get
                        into the Ops Center. It's hard work, lousy hours but this is where you
                        learn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: If you want to see how it operates, yes. I give immense credit to Charles
                    Thomas, later ambassador to Hungary and wherever else. Superb officer,
                    military-political specialist who was director of the Operations Center when I
                    was his deputy. He was the kind of officer who would say that's the way it has
                    been done but it's either not right or let's do it a different way. And in a
                    quiet way he would make sure. He was the spearhead on getting codeword and other
                    highly sensitive material into the Secretary's Morning Summary. He said, for
                    example, why is it necessary for people to have three or four years in the
                    Foreign Service before they can be a junior watch officer. Chuck Redman, who
                    recently has been the ambassador to Sweden and was Assistant Secretary for PA
                    when he was only 40 something. He had gone to the Air Force Academy and had been
                    in the military for several years. Charlie had met him and said let's get him on
                    his first tour. “That's the way to teach a guy.” You don't have to issue visas
                    to know the State Department, although you may have to some time.</p>
                <p>So the revolution was that you could get people who had just come into the State
                    Department. Charles Thomas said, why is it - because of the fewness of women in
                    the Foreign Service - we never seem to get women into the Ops Center jobs.
                    Actually women on the Watch started before Charlie Thomas with Karl Akerman and
                    Bruce Flatin, but Charles just beat the bushes to get women officers in. The
                    percentage of the Foreign Service that comprised women officers in the early
                    '70s was not as large as it would be 20 years later. You had a much smaller
                    pool. But we did get them. I know that for my watch team, although it wouldn't
                    be politically correct to say it now, people said, “Sam Fry and his all girl
                    watch team;” April Glaspie, later ambassador to Iraq and many other things;
                    Aurelia Brazeal who has been ambassador twice; Sylvia Stanfield who has been DCM
                    in Asia, and others. These were top flight young female FSOs who went to the top
                    because they were so qualified and just so good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember there was one young lady I pushed to go: Lang
                        Schermerhorn.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>FRY: Lang Schermerhorn was another example of an absolutely superb officer, who
                    would have been a senior watch officer, but just wasn't quite the grade yet. I
                    think you had to be an 03 or something. We had lots of women and they all did a
                    superb job. That became a thing of the past. There had never been, until 1973, a
                    woman who served as the senior watch officer. Regina Eitz broke that barrier.
                    From then on it wasn't even considered. It was just another job for anyone in
                    the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then from 1975 to 1977, you were in personnel dealing in
                        what, training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, the office was called Training and Liaison. That followed a year at the
                    Industrial College of the Armed Forces for mid-career training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1975 to 1977. What was the main thing
                        you were doing and how did the system work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: The Training and Liaison office of personnel, aside from sitting on the
                    panel that made assignments at several times during the week for all posts, was
                    designed to do two things. The first was to select people for mid-career and
                    senior training. That was a big part of the job, you might say. And also to
                    place people into language training, because Secretary Kissinger was concerned
                    about the level of language training in the State Department. He required
                    designated positions to be filled with language officers. He wouldn't accept no
                    for an answer on why a person wasn't trained and why you were assigning someone
                    who was not language proficient. That became a big part of the program. The
                    other office function was to place State Department officers on detail outside
                    the Department of State. That meant in the Labor Department, Commerce Department
                    — cross-fertilization with different agencies. It was a tough nut to crack
                    because a lot of people felt, “are you just sending the officers you don't want
                    at State and farming them out” or “why is it that they don't want to be working
                    in the State Department” and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>When I took over in 1975, Ambassador Carol Laise, Director General of the Foreign
                    Service, said, “We want to turn that around. We want to find positions in other
                    agencies that would make sense for a Foreign Service officer to be assigned to,
                    and persuade them to take that assignment.” Indeed, that was a challenge and one
                    that I worked on very hard. I did place a number of people in such positions
                    that you wouldn't think of: EPA and their international section, Bill Brown,
                    whom I mentioned before, and who later became a Foreign Service super-star and
                    ambassador to Israel and Thailand, and so on. We tried to change the image of an
                    18 month assignment to another agency to do penance, or because you had a spouse
                    or dependent who was ill and you needed to stay in Washington beyond your
                    cut-off time, to something that would really be considered a good and positive
                    assignment in your career. How successful we were depended on the person, but it
                    certainly changed the idea of that kind of assignment. Also on training, the
                    pressure grew to select people for economic training, for labor training, for
                    use consistently throughout a career. In other words, try and develop a
                    projected pattern of how officers would be assigned and used by the bureaus.</p>
                <p>You wouldn't send a person for a year of area training at Harvard and then at the
                    end of that year assign them to another area. Kissinger and Laise, when they
                    looked at our previous reports, just thought that was crazy, and indeed it was.
                    So, what it did was to give this little office in personnel a lot of power in
                    the assignment panels. What we could do was to say to an ambassador overseas who
                    had worked with a mid-career officer and wanted him or her at that post. “No,
                    that doesn't fit in with the training that they have just had. The post training
                    assignment has to flow in and utilize the training they've had.” It sounds very
                    simple but it wasn't being done up to that point.</p>
                <p>But the other bombshell came when Senator Pearson, who was from Kansas, proposed
                    legislation that was passed in the fall of 1975. In contrast to the then Foreign
                    Service statutes, the new amendment allowed the State Department to assign
                    Foreign Service Officers to the legislative branch - although that came a little
                    bit later - and to state and local governments and eventually to universities.
                    Not for study or to work for a masters degree or something, but to take part
                    actively in the management of a Foreign Affairs program with the university. So
                    this Pearson amendment program was given to the State Department and the
                    Department was enjoined to do something right away.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Well, I had arrived in August 1975, the Act was passed in October and then Carol
                    Laise said: “All right Sam, we want to start assigning people to the governors
                    of states, what are you going to do about it?” What I did was to both write
                    letters and call, and I got a lot of help from senior officers and their
                    contacts all around the country. I told the Director General: “What I have to do
                    is to make some field trips to sell this to key people in high ranking state
                    offices to get a Foreign Service officer on their staff.” I had a travel budget
                    which would have probably taken me down to Richmond and back once a year. So
                    Carol Laise simply chopped out $5000 from the Bureau budget and where it came
                    from I don't know - and said: “This is what you have to build this program, try
                    not to use it all, but use it wisely.” My memory is that my first trip was to
                    Wisconsin to Governor Lucy, where we placed a Foreign Service officer. That was
                    helped out by Larry Eagleburger, because Larry was close friends with Governor
                    Lucy.</p>
                <p>I went to California and talked with the Secretary of State of California, who
                    even after that time was in for another twelve years or more, March Fong Yu, a
                    very powerful political figure in the state. I had to tell her that if she
                    accepted an officer and liked the deal a lot, that she couldn't extend it
                    because, our rule was that you could only have an officer for one year. Well,
                    March Fong Yu is an example of the success of the Pearson program. When the time
                    came after the first assignment of an officer to her she said: “I want another
                    one and don't tell me I can't have it or I'll go up to the President” or
                    something. That was the story. That was after I was gone. In any case I made, as
                    my memory serves, something like fourteen trips around the country: to the
                    states of Washington, New Jersey, Alabama, Michigan, Columbus, Ohio whose mayor
                    was the President of the Conference of Mayors. I spoke to people when they came
                    to Washington, I went to the Hill, went to Congress. Congressmen said: “I want
                    one of these officers” and I had to say: “Well, the Act, the amendment doesn't
                    permit that yet, but we do have our mid-career assignment.” Subsequently the Act
                    was amended so Foreign Service Officers could go up and work in the Foreign
                    Affairs Committee and so on. I placed something like fourteen or fifteen people
                    in the first year of the Act. The program took off after that.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of fine tuning to be done because there were horror stories. For
                    example, the amendment didn't take into account the fact that you were only
                    allowed one move from overseas to the United States at State Department expense.
                    We never thought of the fact that if a person came directly from overseas to
                    Kansas City, and had their furniture sent to Kansas City, two years later, when
                    they came back to Washington, they had to pay for the entire shipment
                    themselves. The regulations allowed only one shipment during a US tour. I mean,
                    it was just loose ends like that when you got into the regs. All of that, over
                    time and after I left, got straightened out. But it was a very exciting period
                    because the criteria, and I think the quality, and number of people going to
                    senior training and mid-career training, increased a great deal, thanks to the
                    pressures and to the desires of - actually in this case - both the White House,
                    which was very supportive, and the senior officers in the Department and the
                    start of this very fine Pearson program.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>In 1992 after my retirement, when I was working on a conference in Fairbanks,
                    Alaska, the FSO who had been detailed to the University of Alaska to help Alaska
                    with its relations with the Soviet Union - she was a Russian speaker, was a
                    Pearson assignee. She became the mastermind and work force of the first
                    post-Cold War arctic conference held in the United States. She was there under
                    the Pearson program. So I had a chance to see my initial work many years later
                    in its full power and effectiveness, thanks to Senator Pearson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great. Well now, let's move on to your next job.
                        You were sort of continuing your northern focus here; you went to Helsinki
                        from 1977 to 1981.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I mentioned that Rozanne Ridgway was a friend of mine and that we had served
                    together in Norway. We stayed friends, not close personal friends, but good
                    professional friends and we liked working with each other when we had the
                    occasion. She had become Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Latin American Bureau
                    and was negotiating all over the world on the new fisheries regulations and the
                    extension of our economic zone. Many new treaties had to be negotiated. When she
                    was appointed ambassador to Finland she called me and asked would I, since I was
                    coming to the end of my time in Washington, be interested in being her Deputy
                    Chief of Mission. I said, indeed I would. The first hurdle was that this was, if
                    everybody's memory was correct then, and I think it was, the first time, since I
                    was no longer married, that an unmarried female career ambassador would have an
                    unmarried male career DCM. Strange things happen in the Foreign Service, but
                    this kind of situation had never come about.</p>
                <p>Believe it or not, there were those who said that would not work. I don't know
                    what they had in mind, but the answer was that it did work very effectively. The
                    other side of the problem was that the position was for a Class Two officer
                    before the grade change occurred in the late '80s. It was a Class Two position
                    and I was a Class Three officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In military terms you were the equivalent to a colonel and
                        this was probably a brigadier-general job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>FRY: Yes, that would be right. It would be the difference today of a Senior
                    Foreign Service position instead of an FSO-1 position. So Rozanne said: “That
                    will be my battle, you just do your job and start thinking about Finland.” Well,
                    it went to the panels and I was told that it would probably not happen and that
                    I had misjudged Ambassador Ridgway's skills. In fact, it did happen and so she
                    went to Finland in the summertime and I went after she got settled. I went in
                    the fall and we were a team from the fall of 1977 until January of 1980, when
                    she returned to become Counselor of the State Department.I say with pride and
                    without hesitation that, based on both the inspections we had there and several
                    other things that happened in Finland and that were happening in the Foreign
                    Service on how you manage posts, that this was one of the top three best managed
                    posts world-wide for several years. The Foreign Service Institute made it a
                    model for its DCM course and for its ambassadorial course. It was a case study
                    in how you manage an embassy. The reason for that was not myself but the fact
                    that Ambassador Ridgway saw very clearly what her role as ambassador was, and
                    what the role should be of the manager of an embassy. It by no means meant that
                    she didn't know what was going on or that she forfeited any of her
                    responsibilities. Quite the contrary. She was splendid in laying out guidelines
                    the way she wanted to see things run, and then you filled in all the blanks.</p>
                <p>We were able to do this very effectively because she had great respect for the
                    staff and the staff was more than dedicated to her, to the point of hurling on
                    swords where necessary. The morale was extremely high. When we had our
                    inspection, the inspectors sort of went away wondering what they should write,
                    because things were working that well. I think it helped disabuse any nonsense
                    that had remained about a single ambassador and a single DCM. I have never yet
                    to this day, wondered whether they thought it would be a personal relationship,
                    which of course it was not. I think it was just the old guard saying; “It's kind
                    of strange, don't you think.” The Finns loved it. She became the toast of the
                    town as a most vivacious - it that's not socially incorrect - person, because
                    she was. I mean she was a vivacious person, she was everywhere. She spread
                    America thicker and with a greater intellectual content than any ambassador in
                    modern times in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>There have been a lot of political and career appointees to Finland, but they
                    didn't have the depth that Rozanne had, and particularly on the Finnish debates
                    about the Cold War and the Soviet Union. She would weigh in and tell them what
                    she thought. Finns are a tough people to get to know. She gave them the sense of
                    confidence that I was, indeed, as the Foreign Service regulations said, her
                    alter ego and that what I was told would be accurately reported to her and to
                    the State Department. So there was never any question when she was out of town,
                    that her deputy spoke for her and for the State Department with her full
                    support.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The Finns had, in 1979, expelled two Russians for activities incompatible with
                    diplomatic status and there were a lot of people who thought, oh oh, we better
                    balance this off now or the Russians will wonder why it is that we are leaning
                    on them. Our Naval attach� did something relatively innocent, but it could be
                    misconstrued. I had an opportunity to handle that. I certainly didn't want the
                    man expelled. I was called into the Foreign Ministry and asked what the Embassy
                    planned to do. So I made a series of proposals to the State Department and said
                    that I would like to go back to the Ministry as soon as possible. Ambassador
                    Ridgway was in Washington and we were able to work something out. But the
                    interesting thing was that there was never a second of hesitation on the Finnish
                    part to treat her deputy exactly as they would have treated her, and believe me,
                    her treatment was absolutely first grade. They considered her probably the
                    strongest and most overall effective American ambassador in Finland since the
                    Second World War.</p>
                <p>There were some others they liked deeply, some very fine ambassadors. But at the
                    time when they needed American reassurance about a number of things that were
                    happening in the aftermath of the Vietnam war and great changes that were
                    developing in the Soviet Union, they needed someone who really understood
                    Finnish views, and would not take the position that Finland was just a stalking
                    horse for the Soviet Union, which it never was. She was the person who more or
                    less turned around the thinking in Washington on that and did a very fine job.
                    Not that she was co-opted by the Finns in any way, but she made people see
                    Finland for what it was, rather than what they thought it was, without being
                    experts on Finnish affairs. In any case, the relationship worked out very, very
                    well.</p>
                <p>The fact about Finland was that we had very good bilateral relations and very few
                    issues that were prickly or were insoluble. Almost everything could be worked
                    out. The question with Finland, however, was that you never wanted to take it
                    for granted. You wanted the Finns to know that they did play an important role
                    in the world community. When you think about it, it was the Finns under UN
                    mandate who were sending, long before many of the other countries were sending
                    their soldiers — and their soldiers were dying in peacekeeping efforts around
                    the world. The UN Blue Beret was a badge of great distinction for the Finnish
                    army, since the army itself had been curtailed in size by the treaty with Russia
                    after the Second World War. The Finns had a highly trained professional corps,
                    although they had conscription, because the army could never be more than 42,000
                    at any one time. They rotated everyone through the reserve, so the top officers
                    were absolutely first rate.</p>
                <p>They proved to be invaluable to the UN. Other Finns were in high positions in the
                    Middle East negotiations and in other areas of international activity. We
                    exchanged sensitive information with the Finns on a continuing basis and did it
                    in a way that reflected on them as equal partners, you might say, in a lot of
                    the international events that were taking place. Not to mention the Namibia war
                    and the war in Biafra — where for reasons which are too lengthy to explain in
                    detail Finland was involved. The Biafran national anthem was the Finnish anthem
                    “Finlandia.” There were a lot of interesting things going on all the time with
                    our Finnish relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The African war was a great play thing of the benign left
                        or something. In the United States for the glitterati, certainly in Sweden,
                        and all the pop stars in London, and all this, I mean, it was an interesting
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes. The war actually was pretty much over by that time, but the
                    Scandinavians had both missionaries and shipments especially of fish to that
                    area amongst other things. For decades before the long revolutionary wars in the
                    Southwest Africa area, Finns had gone there as missionaries. The Finnish
                    Lutheran church was very strong in Namibia. So the Finns had been drawn in, you
                    might say, by the fact that there were a lot of Finnish nationals around there.
                    These were all peripheral things to the major world scene, but nevertheless
                    there was always something that popped up that Finland was involved in.I might
                    add one other thing that was a joy to work on in Finland. Although Finland did
                    not participate for political reasons in the Marshall Plan, it was a country
                    renowned for having paid back its debts. They were debts incurred with the
                    United States after the First World War, and they were paid back on a regular
                    basis. The Finns used to shudder at toasts when someone said, “All Americans
                    know that gallant Finland fought the Russians in the Winter War,” “that Paavo
                    Nurmi was the great Olympic flying Finn,” and “they pay their debts on time.”
                    These were all true, but tiring to hear repeated. Then Finland made an offer in
                    1975 which was that, if America agreed, the last three payments of the debt
                    would be put in escrow, if the US would match them for a pool to allow a fund to
                    develop for the Fulbright exchange program.</p>
                <p>Thousands of Finns had participated in the many levels of the Fulbright exchange
                    program. But, both countries were having, or at least the United States was
                    having occasionally, funding problems. The Finnish idea was that in addition to
                    what both countries could put into the Fulbright program, could there not be
                    seed money that, if invested wisely, would provide a pool which would in times
                    to come even reach perhaps the point where it could be independent of the
                    largess of each country. That occurred, and the money sat for several years
                    while people figured out how to invest it. It grew to something in the range of
                    $700,000 but the stricture was that there had to be an inflation edge taken from
                    the interest, and that only the interest could be used for the grants. It wasn't
                    all that much money when you look at the cost of paying a full exchange
                    professor for one year. As the program developed it was decided that the Deputy
                    Chief of Mission would represent the United States on the investment panel along
                    with a representative from the United States Information Agency and two people
                    from the Finnish side.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I sat on the first board. It was great fun, since it was not my money kind of
                    thing, beginning to figure how we could invest this tax free fund, and build up
                    a pool where we could start using it. What we did as a test case, since there
                    was some money in the pot already, was to establish an American professorial
                    chair at the University of Helsinki in 1977, the 50th anniversary of Finnish
                    independence. An American delegation to this celebration was headed by Joan
                    Mondale, the wife of Vice President Mondale. The bombshell announcement was made
                    about the Chair in international relations and international history. The first
                    participant was a true academic superstar both before and since, John Gadis, who
                    still is the foremost authority on the origins and activities of the Cold War.
                    He was the perfect choice. He was also greatly respected in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A pre eminent historian, to be sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: That's right and, as I say, respected on both sides. Through this fund,
                    which the Finns had originated, he became the first occupant of that Fulbright
                    chair. For the 4 years I was in Finland I sat on that panel. It was very
                    interesting to see it develop. I had occasion in 1980 while Ambassador Ridgway
                    was preparing to leave, to take home leave. I met with Senator Fulbright, who
                    was by that time out of the Senate, and I gave him a briefing on where the
                    program stood. He had heard about this, of course, and it was very heart-warming
                    to see his reaction. If you think that Senator Fulbright was not proud of the
                    Fulbright program, I can tell you this was the thing that he knew he would be
                    remembered for long after the time that he had been a senator and for his role
                    in opposition to the Vietnam war. By 1981, when I left Finland, the mutual
                    exchange of people under all aspects of the Fulbright program had reached 3,000.
                    It was, for the size of the country, by far the largest in the world, and gave
                    the lie to these facts that Finland in the end was sort of under the Soviet
                    orbit.</p>
                <p>This was the kind of program that Finland could have because the Soviet Union
                    didn't have a similar one. In addition, there were thousands of Finnish high
                    school students who were going for their junior year abroad in the United
                    States. I made it a part of my job to speak to every group that I could before
                    they went to the United States for their year. There was the Rotary Club, the
                    Lions Club, or church exchanges, the Lutheran Church particularly since Finland
                    is Lutheran, Youth for Understanding, American Field Service and so on, all
                    these youth exchanges. We were very strong in supporting that in the embassy.
                    The reverse was that not many American kids studied in Finland because of the
                    almost insurmountable language barrier. Of course, most Finnish children were
                    almost fluent in English, I mean that's the way they operate in that country in
                    foreign languages. Whatever was said about Finlandization, or the idea that
                    somehow the Finns were playing their cards close to their chest in dealing with
                    the Soviet Union, perhaps more closely than they had to, the reality was that
                    Finland was totally western-oriented; a market economy. Those of us who worked
                    there wanted to use that orientation the best way we could. The Fulbright
                    Program was an absolutely outstanding example.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Soviet influence? I mean we're still
                        talking about this was not a good period. The Soviets had gone into
                        Afghanistan, Carter had come with big ideas, he ended up firmly anti-Soviet
                        after what happened in Afghanistan and relations were bad. Finland had the
                        reputation of having to be very careful about how it dealt with the Soviet
                        Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Indeed. Finland had a Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union that was
                    extended while I was there. That treaty required Finland to use all its
                    resources to repel any invasion intended for the Soviet Union by way of Finnish
                    territory. That was always misinterpreted in the West, that Finland would fight
                    along side the Soviet Union which, of course, was not what the treaty said.
                    After fifty wars with the Russians over the centuries, and with the brutality of
                    the Winter War in 1940, and then the war from 1941 to 1944 the Finns realized
                    that they could never fight the Soviet Union again. By the same token, they
                    declared their neutrality in the sense that they said that Finnish territory
                    could not be violated by anyone for any purpose. They never said a specific
                    country. But what the Soviets had written into the pact was if Finnish territory
                    is violated by Germany or any nation aligned with Germany, since the Soviet
                    paranoia was always Germany, the Finns would do such and such. The Finns
                    themselves, although it was in the treaty, never used those terms, but they had
                    this burden of defending the idea that Finnish territory could not be used and
                    this led to all sorts of angels on the head of a pin. I mean that Finland could
                    not be violated by anyone.</p>
                <p>What people tend to forget was that the Finnish handling of the Russians was
                    masterful in two ways. From the Russian viewpoint, if you started on the
                    Norwegian border, since Finland has no border on the Arctic Ocean anymore, and
                    went all the way around to Alaska, with the sole exception of Finland, most
                    every country was hostile to the Soviet Union or was in some way a member with
                    the United States in NATO or with SEATO or whatever it was, perhaps India and
                    Iran excepted. We have our troops in South Korea. In other words the containment
                    policy had worked beyond our wildest dreams with the exception of Finland. This
                    gave the Finns and Russians an opportunity to say, ad nauseam, that this is an
                    example of two countries with very different political systems, working in
                    harmony and friendship, and so on and so forth, so you wanted to have a lot of
                    wine to get through the dinner. That was the truth.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The other thing was that Finland has few natural resources and certainly no
                    resources for producing energy. They don't have any waterfalls, any oil, they
                    don't have any coal. So all of their resources for a modern industrial state,
                    which is what Finland certainly is, had to come either from the world price of
                    oil being shipped in or natural gas and oil from the Soviet Union. The deal they
                    worked out with the Soviet Union, which was in full bloom all the time that I
                    was there, was that they would denominate the oil and gas at world prices, or
                    perhaps at a discount, and Finland would supply the Soviet Union with an equal
                    amount of material or equipment or engines or build hotels or help in Russian
                    pulp mills or build railways or whatever it was. Well, this was great for
                    Finland because it kept their assembly lines running at full capacity. When they
                    got non-Russian orders that was even better, because then they got the hard
                    currency. For Finland, almost all energy supplies could be achieved without the
                    expenditure of hard currencies.</p>
                <p>What other country was in that position? The Russians benefitted from the skilled
                    labor and the very high quality of Finnish - excellent quality just superb -
                    equipment. Finns did not get engaged in weaponry other than shotguns or things
                    like that, but they did a lot in construction. That was so good from the Finnish
                    point of view that of course a lot of Finns said; “Maybe some day the Cold War
                    will end and we'll have to pay for all this energy from the Soviet Union in
                    dollars, and that's going to change the picture a lot.” That's what has happened
                    in the 1990s although there are still exchanges under construction contracts and
                    all that. That relationship with the Soviet Union was handled beautifully by the
                    Finns. There was even in their arrangement a deal where if the imbalance - if
                    the Finns imported so much oil and hadn't built factories - that at a certain
                    clearinghouse point they would pay hard currency. But the Finns always got the
                    contracts. They'd really hustled through the Soviet Union, talked to plant
                    managers, “what you need to improve your plan is this and that.” So there
                    wasn't, in fact, any exchange of hard currency. That's just one example of the
                    things that were going on. The Finns had some MiGs and they had western
                    airplanes.</p>
                <p>They had two 440 megawatt nuclear plants that were built by the Russians, but two
                    660 megawatt plants built by the Swedes. The Russians wouldn't build containment
                    shelters. So US Westinghouse built the containment shelters for the Russian
                    plants and everyone called the plants Eastinghouse, since it was part Russian
                    and part western technology. This is the balancing act they did all the way down
                    the line and it worked very well for them. At no time was there ever a truly
                    serious word on the Russian side that they were dissatisfied. There was one time
                    with Khrushchev, I can't recall the story exactly, when Finland had done
                    something or a Finnish politician had said something. “Well maybe we need
                    consultations under the pact”, said the Russians, which was always the scare
                    word for the Finns. The Finns went down to Moscow and said; “those days are
                    over, those days are over, we don't need that kind of behavior from you because
                    we both know what our relationship is and we are carrying it out to the letter”.
                    Whatever the Soviets were talking about was dropped right away. There was never
                    during my time, or immediately before and certainly since, anything that would
                    resemble a crisis between Finland and the Soviet Union, or today's Russia.</p>

                        than Finland, but where the Soviets didn't like the government, and just
                        came in and tried to change it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: It made the Finns very, very uncomfortable. From the day the Soviet invasion
                    started either the ambassador or myself were briefing the top people in the
                    Foreign Ministry on a weekly basis about what the Russians were doing. That
                    slowly died out because nobody expected the war to go on that long. Then
                    President Carter canceled US participation in the Olympics. The Finns disagreed
                    with us entirely, because Finland is, if nothing else, an Olympic country. As a
                    small country it has won medals way out of proportion to it's size and human
                    base. So Finland refused to go with that and said; “why” openly “we don't think
                    this is the right thing to do.” There were various issues in the UN on voting
                    where they were strained, they stretched their limits, but in general if they
                    could abstain or avoid a position which put them either on one side or the other
                    of the super powers, they did so. This met their criteria for behavior which
                    was; Finland is a neutral country that neither favors nor disavows either one of
                    the super powers. It was a dicey time for their diplomats, and in their heart of
                    hearts they thought the Soviet Union was crazy, they thought communism was
                    wrong, but they couldn't say that. But I'll tell you an interesting adventure
                    when the hostage crisis was going on in Iran...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...when the Americans were taken hostage by
                        fundamentalists Islamic forces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: That's right. There were two cases early on where Americans who had escaped
                    the take-over of the compound, found refuge with Finns, were eventually
                    delivered to the Finnish military attach� and were smuggled out of Iran. We said
                    that we wanted to tell the world, and the Finns said; “I beg you quietly. In the
                    diplomatic channels will be fine please.” It was only after it was all over that
                    the fact that the Finns had performed these acts was brought out. The Finns were
                    not willing to be a patsy for either super power, and for a lot of good reasons:
                    for treaty obligations down to emotional reasons. They played their cards the
                    way they thought best for Finland. What else can a small country do when you
                    have 4,800,000 people next to the Soviet Union, and you have a treaty of mutual
                    security, you have to be pretty careful in choosing your words.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem in explaining Finland's position,
                        particularly to American politicians who tried to see things in black and
                        white?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>FRY: Yes we did. Finlandization, which was a German term, was quite the rage at
                    that time. It was looked upon by Finland as a very negative thing, since it put
                    them as a patsy of the Soviet Union. The Finns made an abortive effort to put a
                    positive spin on it, which was that if Finlandization is what we say it is it's
                    too bad other countries can't do it. That is hard to sell since the Finnish
                    situation was unique. It was the only country in the entire world periphery of
                    the Soviet Union that the Soviets could look at without feeling that there was
                    some kind of hostile pressure there, and indeed there was not. So, yes that was
                    a period where they just had to tough it out you might say. They just had to
                    say, and they were always very polite about it and there was always a civil
                    argument, “Well, then perhaps you don't understand fully our history, our
                    conditions, our relationships,” and so on.</p>
                <p>We at the embassy were criticized on occasion for perhaps presenting the Finnish
                    position maybe too clearly. Then it looked like you had gone to too many Finnish
                    saunas. I might interject, but long since I mentioned about going to Finland
                    with a woman ambassador, one of the other things that concerned people when
                    Rozanne Ridgway went was that she couldn't sauna with the President of Finland
                    or the Foreign Minister. She would miss these sauna confidences. This turned out
                    to be utter and complete nonsense, of course. The interesting part was that when
                    she saunaed with their wives she learned a hell of a lot more from them about
                    what was going on in Finland than she ever would have if she had been behind a
                    wall talking with the men. In any case, if there was any slack to be taken up,
                    which there really wasn't, it would have certainly been taken up by others in
                    the embassy.</p>
                <p>The time came when President Urho Kekkonen, who'd been in power for 25 years, was
                    nearly at the end of his reign because he had, as we would probably designate it
                    now, Alzheimers disease. Whatever it was, he was losing his memory. We had
                    prepared in advance, starting with Ambassador Ridgway and working through
                    Ambassador Goodby, a whole series of scenarios. We had done airgrams on every
                    conceivable Finn, how they stood with us, what would be the likely course of
                    Finnish politics if they came in, in other words a really first-class job. So
                    when and if the time came he had a heart attack, we wouldn't be running around
                    saying; “Are they going to go pro-Soviet now? Well, the last public sighting of
                    President Urho Kekkonen was on the fourth of July in 1981 at the American
                    Embassy. It was the first time he had gone in many years. He told his staff; “I
                    want to go to the American Embassy.” We always asked him, of course, but he
                    hadn't come in a number of years. He said; “I want to go to this one.” Kekkonen
                    was removed from office in August but everything was in place for an analysis on
                    our side of who the next President might be. We had already sent in that
                    information. The embassy's position was; “”We want to know what's in it for the
                    United States.”</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The President who was chosen was an American dream. Mauno Koivisto had been head
                    of the Bank of Finland and a personal friend of the embassy for years. We
                    couldn't have had a better relationship with him and suddenly he became the
                    President of Finland. He was a man who never talked about the war, and yet was a
                    pathfinder who used to go over on the Soviet side and slit throats. So the
                    Soviets knew all about Mauno Koivisto. He was the perfect example of Finnish
                    politicians. He had supported the Finnish position on relations with the Soviet
                    Union, he had been a masterful central banker, and yet he was a friend of the
                    United States, if you want to put it in our personal terms, and that worked out
                    beautifully and ended any problem of the Kekkonen demise. Finland had to do some
                    punching on Finlandization here and there, but it wasn't, in the end, a real
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Ambassador James Goodby, who was essentially
                        a nuclear arms control and disarmament genius, how did he fit in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Ambassador Goodby was the intellectual equal in every way of Ambassador
                    Ridgway. I'm not trying to compare them. Their personalities were quite
                    different. He was brilliant, an accomplished author and was precisely the kind
                    of ambassador that the Finns more than appreciated the United States sending.
                    Here was a heavyweight of heavyweights on everything to do with disarmament and
                    nuclear affairs, the kind of thing that the Finns were endlessly involved in at
                    the UN, and in their own society He was asked to speak publicly from the first
                    day. He had many prestigious opportunities to put the American view forward in a
                    quiet way. He knocked down into small pieces the Soviet idea of a Nordic
                    nuclear-free zone. He showed in a very civil and brilliant way, the value of
                    such a policy coming from a country that had the biggest nuclear arsenal in the
                    world fifty miles from the Finnish border in the Kola Peninsula. Jim Goodby was
                    the ideal ambassador for that time and also because a lot of people began to
                    sense that the Soviet Union was in turmoil. Not on the surface, but things had
                    been stretched so far to paper over grave problems. With his long involvement
                    with NATO, Goodby was able to give excellent scenarios, both public and private,
                    to the Finns about NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Just the right ambassador at the
                    right time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Finland in 1981 and you went to Bucharest which
                        was in a way, somewhat the same Soviet border situation, but in a way a
                        whole different scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: That's right. In the Foreign Service I started out on the Iron Curtain in
                    Trieste. In the army I was on the Czech border with an atomic canon. If I wasn't
                    in the Soviet Union I was on its borders. I was told that the Department was
                    interested in someone with an Eastern-European background to interview with a
                    political appointee, David Funderburk from North Carolina. He was highly touted
                    by the conservatives not only as a conservative, because he had worked briefly
                    in Romania as a USIA guide. Senator Jesse Helms supported him. He was Helms'
                    candidate for Romania.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I interviewed with him to be DCM. Basically, he said; “Do you have any feeling
                    about political appointee ambassadors?” And I said; “I've worked under political
                    appointee ambassadors. It is not a question of dealing with political appointees
                    or career officers, you deal with the Chief of Mission.” I said; “I feel that
                    way very strongly.” The regulations notwithstanding about being an alter ego,
                    you fit into the ambassador's game plan in so far as it's consonant with US
                    policy and the ambassador's instructions. So I said that wouldn't be a problem
                    for me. I said; “I don't speak Romanian, I speak Italian and Russian,” and they
                    tell me Romanian is a blend between the two of them. I don't really believe that
                    about any language, but I thought I could learn it. Funderburk spoke Romanian.
                    He had been there as a USIA guide years before and his Ph.D. was on some aspect
                    of the Romanian/British relations in the 19th century. Anyway, he picked me. I
                    did have some Romanian language training to get a start on how the language was
                    constructed. I already read about Romania quite a bit, I mean I knew a lot about
                    the Eastern European countries. I went to Bucharest in October 1981, and was
                    there until selected for the Senior Seminar in 1983. So I was there just under
                    two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have taken Funderburk's oral history. He's now a
                        congressman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, he was elected in the 1994 conservative sweep into Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came out more than almost any other political appointee
                        as someone extremely suspicious of the Foreign Service, at least this is my
                        impression, and somebody who felt essentially that our policy towards
                        Romania was too lenient. He didn't agree with what our policy was. That's
                        what I gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: You gather correctly. He had three positions: first, he believed that the US
                    policy for Romania was the State Department's position, not the President's and
                    that the brainwashing of President after President to approve the “most favored
                    nation” status for Romania was tantamount to treason. We were propping up a
                    dictator, we were causing suffering in Romania, and we had no business doing
                    this. We ought to put our cards on the table and tell the world what Romania was
                    and stop all this nonsense about Nicolae Ceausescu being the first communist to
                    recognize West Germany, the only communist leader to have relations with Israel,
                    and so on. You could make a list of 30 or 40 things, some of which I'll mention
                    later, things that they had done to appear maverick in the Soviet system.
                    Funderburk violently disagreed with that analysis.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>His was not a unique position incidentally, a lot of people felt this way. Also,
                    he believed that a conservative in government, no matter who appointed him,
                    would always be under suspicion by the system. He had deep and grave
                    reservations about the State Department system; just the State Department as the
                    State Department it didn't matter who was running it, whether it was Secretary
                    George Shultz or anybody else. He was very paranoid about whether people were
                    going behind his back, were embassy officers going behind his back to try to do
                    things. In my naivete I tried to explain that that's not the way embassies work.
                    I mean, embassy officers like myself do not send telegrams that the ambassador
                    doesn't see. He was not the representative from the State Department, as he had
                    learned in his preparation course. He was the representative of the President.
                    At any time, day or night, that he wanted to talk to the President of the United
                    States - I mean in theory - although smart ambassadors wouldn't do that more
                    than once, he could go to the President. He could certainly send in a
                    first-person message and slug it through the White House and info Secretary
                    Shultz or whatever.</p>
                <p>As I said, the idea that you're surrounded by hostile people, and so on, I don't
                    think holds water, but then again I didn't realize how deeply paranoid he was. I
                    also didn't realize what a true dyed-in-the-wool deep religious, far right
                    conservative is all about. I subsequently have learned in American politics what
                    that's all about and so have a lot of Americans. The book which emerged from his
                    stay in Bucharest, as we all knew was being written, was called: “Between the
                    Pinstripes and the Communists”. That shows you that we were equally balanced as
                    far as Funderburk was concerned. I considered that that was the kind of
                    mentality a strongly narcissistic personality would develop, in which only your
                    position is right and every one else is seen as an enemy - whether an enemy or a
                    hit list of Nixon or whatever.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Funderburk really disliked Nixon. When Nixon came to Romania he even
                    left the country. I took the Nixon visit and had dinner with Nixon and
                    Ceausescu. Funderburk would not be seen with Nixon and Ceausescu. The reason, of
                    course, was that all of this time he was planning to run for high office and he
                    did not want photographs appearing later on of a Funderburk sitting with
                    Ceausescu and Nixon. This would have been death to his position and that's why
                    he actually left Romania when Nixon came. He played his cards that way all the
                    way through his term. On his tour there everything was geared to what would
                    eventually be grist for the book, prior to his run for Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>When he did leave Romania, the first thing he did was to hold a press conference
                    in Vienna which bashed US policy before he even got back to the United States.
                    That was all played up in the press. After he left the State Department he
                    subsequently ran for US Senator in North Carolina and was trounced. FSOs like
                    Larry Eagleburger said; “This isn't the kind of man you want as your senator” -
                    I don't know but it is what he says in his book - how much they did say I don't
                    know. I didn't pay any attention to his campaign and was not involved either
                    way. In fact, I was still in the Foreign Service and when I was called up by
                    reporters about his campaign, I said that there's one thing that I hold sacred
                    in the Foreign Service. That is the relationship between the Deputy Chief of
                    Mission, who had served as Charge on frequent occasions, and an ambassador -
                    while either one is still in the Service. This relationship should inviolate,
                    and I would not break any confidences for whatever reason. And that was the end
                    of that, I never made any comments on his politics.</p>
                <p>But going back to Romania, it's interesting that in Funderburk's book, all of the
                    bad guys are in Washington. He was fairly balanced with his staff and the staff
                    comes in for no derogatory mention whatsoever in any way in the book. I think
                    this was because it would have been a little untoward for the people who were
                    drafting your messages or were giving you the information that you wanted to do
                    messages to be pilloried. Near the end of my tour, the Romanians instituted a
                    penalty for leaving Romania. I won't go into the whole Romanian visa story,
                    which is an oral history in itself — Romanians selling people to go to Israel,
                    and selling people to go to the United States, and selling people to go to
                    Germany, which is the whole thread of how Ceausescu treated his people. He had a
                    special tax on emigrants with an education. If they were getting an American
                    visa, they would have to pay $25,000 in dollars, which means the American people
                    who were sponsoring these people would have to ransom them out. We, at the
                    embassy, went crazy over this and said to the Department; this is a time to
                    really come out against this policy. The State Department didn't see it that
                    way. Larry Eagleburger came out and tried to smooth things over. Ceausescu never
                    really gave in. What happened was that he sort of said; “We won't enforce it
                    yet” and until he was shot it was still on the books but it wasn't enforced. In
                    the end, we got what we wanted, and he got what he wanted and it worked out, but
                    it was pretty bloody in the meantime, because the embassy was then seen as being
                    sort of hyperbolic about the State Department's position.</p>
                <p>In the end what the American business community wanted and what Congress seemed
                    to want was, in the absence of any horror stories beyond which we were dredging
                    up, that Romania would continue to get MFN. When Ambassador Funderburk went to
                    DC and they were talking about this around the table — well he told me this
                    himself and Larry Eagleburger mentioned it later and Shultz's staff aide told me
                    later — they all went around how they were going to go and how they were going
                    to present this to the President. Eagleburger gave a note to Funderburk which
                    said; “Do you agree with this? Do you want to make a dissent?” Funderburk said,
                    in fact; “Yes, OKAY, I'm not going to make waves.”</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Later he would say, “What could I do against this juggernaut;” what could he do
                    as one man fighting the pinstripes while being squashed by the communists. But
                    he never, in all of his time in Romania, ever sent a first-person message, never
                    sent any message to the State Department which explicitly said; “You must not
                    under any circumstances continue MFN. He went to Washington as ambassador and
                    managed to have a meeting with the President which was arranged by Faith
                    Whittlesey, another right-winger and later ambassador to Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Ronald Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, a meeting with President Ronald Reagan. Jim Baker and Ed Meese were
                    there. What he said in effect was; “Mr. President, you don't know what's
                    happening out in Romania. The State Department is keeping it from you,” and so
                    on. Meese and Baker were absolutely astonished as I later learned since they
                    didn't know what the meeting was about Funderburk had just said he wanted to
                    meet with the President. Shultz was not invited, nor had Funderburk told Shultz
                    or anybody in the State Department that he was going to do this.</p>
                <p>When Shultz heard about it from Baker, Funderburk had just gone back to North
                    Carolina. Shultz brought him back immediately to Washington. In Funderburk's
                    book he wears this as a badge of honor that he was brought back and put on the
                    carpet. He was the only person who would stand up for what was right and
                    honorable in foreign policy as it dealt with Eastern Europe and with Romania.
                    Shultz just saw it as a complete stab in the back and betrayal according to what
                    his aides later told me, because he simply said; “If anyone has ever been open
                    to any position it has been myself, anyone can come to me, any ambassador. They
                    have said we are not doing it right we ought to change it. Funderburk never came
                    to me, never even sent me a message saying that he was concerned.” So that's the
                    relationship. There were times when I felt that he was very unfair with members
                    of the embassy.</p>
                <p>For example, the incident with the son of Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson, who had
                    one of the longer and most distinguished diplomatic careers. His son, Steve, was
                    a political officer. As Steve and his wife were leaving the post, in the final
                    staff meeting in the secure room, as we were saying goodbye, Ambassador
                    Funderburk said something to the effect of: “Well, all I can see since I have
                    been here is that you appear to be working for Securitate,” that is the Romanian
                    Service. “In presentations you've tried to do the Romanians favors,” and things
                    like that. I had never before or since heard of a chief of mission make such a
                    statement in public to a subordinate.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I would do a telegram based on a meeting with Grand Rabbi Moishe Rosen, who would
                    pass me a written note to avoid electronic surveillance. The Grand Rabbi was not
                    a person that Funderburk trusted or liked—and I would have to tell you that it
                    was reciprocated, although not publicly. The Jewish Romanian leadership worked
                    with the Israelis and with the Romanians to get more Jews out of Romania to
                    Israel. Funderburk thought Rosen was a fraud. Anyway, if I came back and sent a
                    telegram that said I was called in by the Grand Rabbi and this is what he said,
                    and then I put our twist on it at the end that would be in the comment, so
                    whatever the comment was. I would say to Funderburk this is what I would suggest
                    as a comment—”It's a self-serving statement and he's coming to the States and
                    he's getting ready to go, you know, it's the usual from the Chief Rabbi of
                    Romania.” But Funderburk might say; “Yes, but you really believe him don't you,
                    he's really convinced you hasn't he.” In other words, I was sucked in by his
                    propaganda in my reporting and I really felt that we should be nice to the
                    Romanians because they were good people. Funderburk never understood that when
                    you report exactly what the other side says, as a matter of historical record,
                    that you were not promoting their position. He was an historian who did not want
                    verbatim history reported.</p>
                <p>I never felt that way at all. I carried out American policy. When Secretary
                    Alexander Haig wanted to come to Romania he said in a message; “Tell me why I
                    can come” so we did. Funderburk was dying a thousand deaths, because he didn't
                    want Haig to come but he approved all of the messages. I said; “Well, look he
                    wants to come here, he wants to be a Secretary of State who's going into a
                    communist country, why don't we use it for our advantage? If we are going to say
                    no, you, the Ambassador must put in a first-person-message. The post can't say
                    that the embassy feels it would not be a good thing.” You can't do that with a
                    Secretary. You've got to be the ambassador saying no. He wasn't willing to do
                    that. I said; “Why don't we put a spin on it? Tell the Romanians that Haig is
                    completing a long trip—three countries—he's coming from Morocco and several
                    other places and will hold a press conference for the western press and anybody
                    who wants to come. He is going to answer any questions he wants the way he wants
                    to do it whether it's about Romania or not. He's going to have a western-style
                    press conference.” That is exactly what happened and what Haig did. I can't
                    remember now about remarks concerning Romania, but in any case he had a full
                    western-style press conference. Frank Carlucci, who was then the Deputy Defense
                    Secretary came to Romania and Eagleburger came.</p>
                <p>After I left George Bush came as Vice-President—I don't know what all the
                    circumstances were on that, but Funderburk decided to leave and come back to the
                    United States, where he set up his pins by having a press conference in
                    Vienna.</p>
                <p>I had cordial personal relations with him, certainly with Mrs. Funderburk and the
                    family, and I worked very, very hard. My performance reports were okay and, as a
                    family, they always treated me well. But I know he didn't trust me, and that's
                    where I more or less left it when I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view and maybe talk about the embassy aside
                        from the ambassador? What was your view Romania in this 1981-'83 period,
                        Ceausescu and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I believed that Ceausescu had gotten away with one of the greatest Cold War
                    ploys, which was appearing one way to the West and yet maintaining in his own
                    country probably the worst cult of personality dictatorship and abusive human
                    rights that had existed since Stalin. He was a master at juggling this. He had
                    stood up to the Soviet Union in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Prague, which was
                    his great strength in the West. That is the reason that President Richard Nixon
                    visited Romania in 1969. Nixon wanted to be the first president to visit a
                    communist country. He thought it would aid in a split ala Yugoslav-style in the
                    50's, to sort of reward Ceausescu for not being in the group that invaded in the
                    “Prague spring.” That gave Ceausescu a lot of ideas on what he could get away
                    with.</p>
                <p>Of course everybody knew, I mean who worked with Romania, that the conditions the
                    country itself lived in, and the cult of personality, was just so out of control
                    that it evened out Stalined, Stalin. Everything in the paper was Ceausescu. It
                    was almost sickening to live there and have to see this. I refused to stand up
                    at a meeting, which wasn't a government one - Ceausescu wasn't there as
                    President, but communist party head - and the Chief of Protocol came over and
                    told me I better well start standing up and down as the audience jumped up and
                    down. I said; “I'm sorry I was invited as a representative of the United States
                    to see this Communist Party meeting, it is not a meeting of the government to
                    which I'm accredited.” And that was that. That was about my only public
                    display.</p>
                <p>Other times I had to shake hands or something like that. But on the other hand,
                    what were you going to do? What were the alternatives? We were getting two to
                    three thousand Romanians a year who were joining families in the United States.
                    11,000 were going to Germany. 3 or 4,000 a year were going to Israel, and others
                    were emigrating, although it was very hard for them to do so. There was a
                    semblance of a USIA exchange program, that we didn't have with other communist
                    countries. Were we to simply stop diplomatic relations? In which case what would
                    be the grounds; that cult of personality? What do you do then about the Congo?
                    What do you do about Nicaragua? Talk about cult of personalities and things like
                    that! I'm not comparing the social systems obviously, but I mean if you're
                    talking about not liking the head of state or the governor... So the point was
                    how do you juggle it?</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>For most of the businessmen, when the crunch came for deciding about MFN
                    treatment, there was a point where we had a billion dollar trade with Romania
                    heavily in our favor to the tune of some $600 million balance of payments in
                    favor of the United States. For these businessmen and for our agricultural
                    surpluses, things were flowing to Romania. We had our NATO ship visits through
                    the Bosporus every year. Destroyers would play radar tag with the Russian navy
                    and drive the Russians bananas in the Black Sea. We did have a window on the
                    Warsaw Pact from a Warsaw Pact country that wasn't participating in Warsaw Pact
                    maneuvers. Any change in that, any blip on the radar screen, would show how
                    Romania was actually dealing. We did find some things where they said they
                    weren't helping the Russians at all in the Warsaw Pact, but may have been in
                    small ways, not in major ways. Their command and control for air defense
                    remained in Warsaw Pact control. So, there were a lot of variables and like
                    anything in diplomacy, perhaps in life, but certainly in international affairs,
                    it wasn't all black and white. Day in day out we went with lists of why is this
                    person in jail, why can't he leave? We were just insistent. They finally would
                    get very annoyed at us at the Foreign Ministry even though they were more or
                    less all on our side. There are guys who - after Ceausescu was shot - came right
                    to the fore and ran things at the ministry.</p>
                <p>Romania is a very complex country that never had democracy. Anyway, it wasn't a
                    matter that if we snubbed Ceausescu some good guy would show up. I mean, he was
                    going to stay until he got a bullet; that was pretty clear and probably his son
                    would come in then. No it wasn't a hard one to call the shots unless you were
                    willing to say no most favored nation treatment. Near the end, Ceausescu said;
                    “I don't need your MFN”. And when it finally went away he said; “I can do
                    without it, you can't use that as anything against me”. And that's exactly what
                    happened. So other than MFN, what would have been your leverage to stop them?
                    Stop reuniting the families, stop agricultural trade, stop the naval visits? We
                    had to swallow a very, very bad dictator, who was very cruel to his people and
                    caused a lot of suffering and hardship. But have we done that in the interest of
                    peace somewhere else? I think we have, often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have this type of conversation with
                        Funderburk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Oh Yes, we talked about... I mean he was a guy of heavy mood swings and
                    there were times when he said; “yes I understand” or something but he didn't
                    really. He wanted to be where he is today. He wanted to be in the Senate or the
                    House of Representatives. He had a plan and he was going to write that book and
                    so on. So, full credit. He has managed to ride the wave right to where he
                    wanted. When he came out he used all his pull with Romanian groups all around
                    the country. And human rights groups. He's got awards — bushel baskets full. He
                    played his cards exactly as he wanted and he's got what he wants. So, that's
                    what Americans do, that's the way successful careers are made, regardless of a
                    person's real inner qualities.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the staff? I mean part of the thing with the
                        embassy is the DCM is not only the “alter ego” of the ambassador, but when
                        you have an ambassador who obviously is not willing to go along with the
                        Foreign Service professionally, you would have the other role of trying to
                        keep up the morale and all without undercutting the ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Well, yes I see what you're saying and it didn't work, because it wasn't
                    that kind of a relationship. He had three secretaries while I was there,
                    including one that was non-career who was sent out by Senator Jesse Helms. He
                    felt they were all betraying him and that they were all undercutting him and
                    stealing his secrets. He couldn't hold a secretary there. He didn't like some
                    people in the embassy and when they left, as I mentioned, he said; “”Well good
                    riddance.” On the other hand there were people in the embassy he did like, who
                    were very fine officers and good analysts. The business of trying to soften his
                    cruel remarks, I never did and never would consider. If someone had been hurt by
                    his comments or something, I would not say “Well I'm sure he really didn't mean
                    it”. I never said it. I thought to myself, “what the ambassador says to people
                    is the ambassador's business and I'm not going to fuzz it or do anything else.”
                    I didn't talk to people like that and so that was my style.</p>
                <p>He was not liked by the diplomatic community for a lot of reasons. He didn't like
                    them and considered their dislike a badge of honor. He didn't like the German
                    ambassador so he snubbed him at a big evening. The German ambassador came to me
                    and said, “What's going on in your embassy?” He didn't like to go to the NATO
                    meetings at the other embassies or have it at ours and they didn't think they
                    got a very good briefing from him. So when I went they would say things like,
                    “oh boy now we have a professional!” I would tell them, “I will not accept that
                    comment, I do not appreciate it and I do not like my ambassador thought of in
                    those terms” and I meant it very sincerely. I didn't want to say; “Yes isn't it
                    a horrible life” or something, because it wasn't. I felt they were wrong in
                    making an allusion like that. I told the German ambassador and I told the
                    Italian ambassador on occasion and several others that if they thought that they
                    could talk about an ambassador that I was working for, about him behind his back
                    to me, they were dead wrong. That's the way I played it, and no one could ever
                    deny that I can tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was morale like at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>FRY: Well I think the morale—I mean it was a difficult post in the sense of very
                    little Romanian cooperation on everyday requests. But I don't think the
                    ambassador hurt morale. He may have intellectually for some people, but not for
                    everybody if you think of the embassy as a whole. He was behind us building a
                    lunchroom and an after-hours place. He had movies every Saturday night and he
                    invited as many Romanians as he could. He cultivated a lot of Romanians and got
                    them together with our people. He used the residence very, very well. He
                    constantly tried to get marginal shades of Romanians in. He had huge 4th of July
                    receptions and invited dissidents. He went up country and talked to priests. He
                    went to churches and he used to report on the Baptists. He was doing some
                    positive things. Don't get the idea that he was sitting back because he didn't
                    like the policy. He was pursuing his own policy in the sense of having as much
                    outreach as he could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the timing work out? Was he still there when you
                        went to the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Oh yes. I would have probably left—the DCM assignments in Eastern Europe
                    generally were two years, the ambassadorial assignments weren't much more than
                    that. I believe that he stayed until early 1985. Frank Corey, a fine officer,
                    good analyst and good communist scholar, who had been head of the political
                    section, was made DCM . The ambassador didn't want to bring in a new person. So
                    Frank moved up, and a person came in for the political section and that worked
                    out fine. They had a good relationship. Funderburk's views never changed on the
                    State Department and I'm sure they never will. He was fixed on that from the
                    time that he was a USIA guide. There was a story told, later documented, that
                    when he was a USIA guide in Romania he complained to his congressman even then
                    about embassy treatment. He felt he wasn't getting a fair shot from the embassy.
                    I think David Funderburk, with all the qualities he had, including some things I
                    liked about him, had it in for the State Department and nothing and no one ever
                    would have changed that.</p>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>FRY: This was 1983 to 1984. I was often asked if the Seminar is something that
                    the Foreign Affairs community really needed and that needed to be funded and all
                    that. Even in those days those questions were being asked. My feeling always
                    was, yes in many ways. But I did not see the Senior Seminar as absolutely
                    crucial to senior management positions in the government. So while I loved it, I
                    would never argue that it was crucial for one's career or that what you would
                    learn there would always make the difference of success in a senior position.
                    However, having said that, nothing could ever take away from the marvelous
                    opportunity to learn just about everything you want about this country, and the
                    nooks and crannies you may have missed during your many years overseas, which
                    was one of the Seminar's intentions.</p>
                <p>In my case it also helped me a great deal because I was continuing an interest
                    that had been developing over the years in the Arctic and arctic areas. During
                    my opportunity to travel when we were doing our paper for the year, I chose
                    native Arctic people and their changing political and economic identity. It
                    allowed me to travel to Alaska and do several other things that were in
                    connection with the arctic areas. I must say that served, some seven years later
                    when I left the Foreign Service, to be very important. Contacts I had made then
                    paid off, although I didn't realize it at the time—sort of my own preparation
                    for life after the Foreign Service that has stood me in good stead.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of the Senior Seminar, or near the end, I did not have an
                    onward assignment and I was not going to go overseas. This was in January or
                    February 1984. I knew I didn't want to go overseas immediately after seven years
                    out. One thing that surprised me—and contrary to what you might expect from
                    people in the Seminar—I was receiving no knocks on the door, at least from my
                    own bureau of EUR, although I did get possibilities overseas. When I was called
                    by Bill Harrop, who was then the Inspector General, I thought to myself, “Well
                    there's a position I think I know a lot about, having been inspected a number of
                    times.” It would allow for a goodly amount of travel out of Washington, but at
                    the same time it would be a Washington assignment, so I gladly accepted
                    that.</p>
                <p>Harrop ran a good recruitment drive. I think I had some excellent colleagues who
                    came in at that time to the Inspection Corps. I visited fourteen countries that
                    I had never visited before and went to something like twenty-four posts. That
                    was a wonderful education process again, proving that you're never over-educated
                    in the Foreign Service. I found one of the most satisfying things in that job—if
                    I could put it in two words—was righting wrongs; that is, not cosmic changes at
                    a post, but getting to the problem of some conditions whether they were driven
                    by personalities or management problems or whatever. Just making sure they were
                    solved before you left. I'm sorry that some of the issues had to come to having
                    the inspectors solve them rather than being solved on the ground, in place so to
                    speak. At least there was some satisfaction in seeing all parties then on a more
                    positive relationship basis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give some examples - whether you mention names or
                        not is not terribly important - but just an idea of what you mean, because
                        the inspection service has changed considerably. We're talking about you
                        were there doing this from '84 to '86. Can you talk about some of the
                        righting-wrongs that you got involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: There were a number senior officers—although they didn't have to be all that
                    old, maybe in their early to late '50s—who had not made, in my view, the
                    transition to a modern Foreign Service in their relationships with junior
                    officers and the responsibilities that senior officers have to their training
                    and to their professional growth. Their attitude, I think, was subtly hostile
                    toward women in the Foreign Service. Certainly their attitude towards what was
                    then even sort of a dying breed in the Foreign Service secretary—I say dying
                    breed in the sense of dictation or all the things that are now purely passe in
                    the age of electronics—was patronizing. I felt on a number of occasions that
                    they simply didn't give people credit for the skills they had. I had the feeling
                    that I was back in what I was told what it was like in the ''40s and ''50s and
                    even when I joined in the early ''60s.</p>
                <p>I think the solution there usually turned out to be a heart-to-heart talk, with a
                    little bit of the steel edge showing from the Inspection Corps side on what the
                    problems were. We couldn't reveal specifically what was in the personal
                    questionnaires. But you could certainly work around it in such a way as to let
                    people know that they really needed to do something about the way they were
                    managing people in the Foreign Service. There were other cases that would border
                    on near, I would say, malfeasance, where a DCM and the ambassador together
                    simply lost perspective as far as I was concerned. It was to the point where,
                    even after considerable talk and explanation of what we were driving at, we
                    didn't seem to get through. We recommended that the Deputy Chief of Mission
                    leave the Service or certainly not have any more managerial assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I'm talking about, for example, using non-US citizens who were well
                    connected to US business men, in embassy positions such as in the protocol
                    office of the embassy where they were dealing quite closely with the ambassador
                    and the DCM, and had access to, almost free access to the ambassadors area,
                    although they themselves had undergone only a very cursory security check. Upon
                    careful checks on our part that turned out to be the kind of person you would
                    not want in your embassy. Certainly not in an embassy position where they saw
                    all of the guest lists, the discussions about who would come to dinner and why
                    they would come and things like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>It's hard to be a bit more specific, I guess the confidences still prevail on
                    specific cases. But my overall feeling was, as it really had been before I was
                    in the Inspection Corps, that the inspection served an absolutely essential
                    purpose in the Foreign Service. The main purpose is accomplished before you
                    arrive at the post. That is, by the time everyone has filled out the forms and
                    thought about what they're doing and thought about “am I up-to-date in certain
                    reports” or whatever their responsibilities might be, that just about eliminated
                    most of the problems. So what you really did at the post was to concentrate on
                    the issues that meant a lot in a morale sense, and also to follow up on concerns
                    that the bureaus or the country director might have. They asked for your
                    judgment in saying; “Are we right in thinking that certain things are not being
                    handled quite the way they should be.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with say the problem of alcoholism. Did
                        you get involved, in those cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, I've had during my time as DCM, Inspector, and once as an Officer
                    Director in the Department, five cases where I got directly involved in
                    alcohol-abuse matters. The first time was with a civil servant and I was very
                    discouraged at the way this was handled. Not that I wanted any punishment, quite
                    the contrary, I wanted medical help. But by the time I did the monitoring and
                    writing the report and talking with her and going through all the procedures—but
                    this was in the ''70s—it ended up that nobody really did anything about it. Nor
                    did she, and she therefore continued on a path which eventually was really bad
                    for her health and led to her leaving the government for that matter. In the
                    Foreign Service people, in general, accepted the idea that alcoholism is a
                    disease and deserves to be, at least in the first instance, treated with
                    government help. After that the rules get tougher.</p>
                <p>So in the Foreign Service I had excellent cooperation. The Department came
                    through beautifully with support in the field, with the rehabilitation program
                    in the Department, and then a good onward assignment. Cases were resolved so
                    favorably that the people had long and interesting careers in the Foreign
                    Service. That was very encouraging to me, that these things can definitely be
                    worked out. I was always impressed with the modern day attitude of the medical
                    office both in mental health problems and in alcoholism. The psychiatric advice
                    which I received in two posts in and near Eastern Europe for people that I was
                    responsible for, was excellent and thoughtful and responsive to the point of a
                    doctor visiting the post and really getting down into the nub of the problems.
                    In the Inspection Corps it was more a matter of going to a supervisor or to the
                    DCM and saying, do you understand how bad the situation has gotten? We would
                    usually have her or him on an airplane within 48 hours. That's the kind of
                    response time the Department was willing to give us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, we're talking about the early ''80s,
                        what would happen if you found an officer, staff, but basically an officer
                        who had a spouse problem—usually a wife—who would say that alcohol was
                        making a serious problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: That's a difficult situation because the dependents, the spouses, were, in
                    effect, out of our jurisdiction, unless a situation had a direct and immediate
                    effect on the performance of the officer or the staff person in question. In the
                    couple of cases I can think of, where a situation was the talk of the town, the
                    only thing you could do would be to suggest to senior management in the embassy
                    that this was deleterious to embassy operations, in the sense of reputation, and
                    that it was simply cruel to the person in question to keep them in this kind of
                    situation without going for help. We said, regardless of the immediate
                    responsibility and the willingness or unwillingness of the husband or wife, that
                    the embassy should take a firm step and request that the medical division help
                    the person go for treatment.</p>
                <p>In one Latin American country, Brazil to be exact, this was done and I think with
                    great success. In two cases that I can think of while we were there nothing was
                    done. While I was in the Senior Seminar, I had occasion to visit a post where
                    the senior officer was clearly alcoholic during a luncheon and on into an
                    afternoon session and was a gross embarrassment to everyone present. He missed
                    his own reception in the evening. The military members of the Seminar were so
                    incensed that they wanted to write an immediate letter to the Secretary of
                    State. They couldn't believe that someone could be on duty in his condition.
                    Since we weren't inspectors, we simply talked with the relevant Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary and country director when we returned. We asked if they were aware of
                    this problem or had heard rumors. We could advise them that it was far, far
                    worse than anything they could imagine. That led to the person being removed
                    from the post for what I understood, later on, was full recovery. So this pops
                    up in the Foreign Service: what I guess amazes me over my entire career is that,
                    given the number of people that you're crossing paths with, that both in terms
                    of alcohol abuse and drug abuse—and this is certainly not to mitigate it—it was
                    a surprisingly small part of my career both in terms of people that I was
                    directly responsible for and things that I could witness. So while the cards are
                    on the table and the statistics are well known, I think the Service, in general,
                    is probably in very good shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other saga, sexual harassment and race
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>FRY: I was never involved in either of this kind of case. That is to say either
                    as a witness or someone brought into a grievance. I've never been involved in a
                    grievance myself or in anybody else's. Whether that is luck I don't know. I just
                    didn't happen to be in places where that occurred. I was surprised when I came
                    back to the State Department in 1983 at what I thought were clear cases of, if
                    not discrimination, sexual harassment of women in many layers of the State
                    Department. And a lot of those turned out to be people in secretarial positions,
                    mail room type operations; service operations. My feeling was—most of those were
                    civil service—that they just hadn't gotten the word. Overseas I don't know what
                    all the women were thinking that I worked with or that I observed. I didn't know
                    of any cases where I would have felt we should take an immediate action.</p>
                <p>Of several ambassadors that I worked with, two were women. Rozanne Ridgway told
                    me she felt her early career was hindered by discrimination against women; that
                    women belong only in the consular service or things to that effect. She was
                    acutely sensitive to this in all of her relations with her staff and the staff's
                    relations with each other. In the Inspection Corps yes, there were cases that
                    were brought to our attention and some of those, as I understood later, became
                    grievances. It is very hard on the spur of the moment, when you're in a post for
                    two or three weeks, to make a sensible presentation of something which may have
                    been ongoing in subtle ways for years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed during the Reagan administration, and it has
                        continued on, that we were having people getting killed, we were having
                        people living under very difficult circumstances - talking of the Foreign
                        Service - and yet one big sign in corridors even today, was to report waste,
                        fraud and mismanagement, which all struck me as being; “Yes, that's a
                        problem, but that's not exactly a battle call to go out there and deal with
                        a very difficult situation”. How did you find the waste, fraud and
                        mismanagement element of the inspection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: In the inspection corps there was a hot-line for waste, fraud and
                    mismanagement. I was not directly a part of it. If there had been a charge made
                    at the post we were going to it was on our list of things to examine. I found
                    fraud non-existent. I never handled a case and I never was involved in a case
                    where direct fraud, that is something that would be resolved in a criminal
                    action, was uncovered. Waste? Very little surprisingly enough. Most of the
                    things that come to mind are things where people use modern communications
                    facilities, such as xeroxing, for their own use, you should be excited about it
                    in an inspection sense, but it's awfully hard to make too big a point of it
                    other than to say; “You shouldn't be putting out the fact of a general sale on
                    the weekend on government paper.”</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I think that your point about the security situation in the Foreign Service
                    should be used in our relations with Congress when talking about what it is that
                    the Foreign Service does. I used to make the point often, long before the deaths
                    that have occurred in the ''80s and ''90s, that by the end of the 1970's, more
                    Foreign Service officers and staff had died in the line of duty than all of the
                    FBI officers in all of the history of the FBI and pre-FBI in this century. The
                    lost of life, if you just take Vietnam as a ratio to the number of people in the
                    Foreign Service, was by far—except for the direct military—the highest in any
                    federal government department or agency. When I was at mid-career training at
                    the Industrial College of The Armed Forces in a math course, I did some kind of
                    analysis—which started out more or less for fun—on the people who were at that
                    time on the roster of deceased in the line of duty in the entrance to the State
                    Department. I believe there were over one hundred at that time. It went quickly
                    from lost on a ship in a hurricane—some of the older ones—to exactly what it
                    was, which was a direct death as a result of terrorism or dying as a result of
                    peripheral military activity in the Middle East and places like that. That was
                    telling the tale already in 1975. Since that time, and right up to Bosnia and
                    Yugoslavia, the case has been made. When people talk about the Foreign Service
                    as a nice, I don't say cushy, they don't say cushy job, but having fun overseas
                    and so on, I say; “Well, would you feel differently if you knew that your child
                    had to ride to school in a bus which was lined with sand bags? How do you think
                    that would effect their growing up?” and so on. The point about change in
                    Foreign Service life, if I were to put my finger on the two things that I see as
                    the most important, are: communications and personal security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved from being an inspector to Public Affairs
                        from '86 to '88.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: At the end of my time in the Inspection Corps, I was interviewed for a
                    deputy assistant secretary job in human rights and humanitarian affairs and also
                    in the environmental bureau, OES, in dealing on the environmental side which I
                    was very interested in. As it turned out I did not get either of those jobs. At
                    the same time I was informed about a public affairs job, which didn't excite me
                    at the start, in the office of Public Programs. The future seemed to lie,
                    according to Secretary Shultz, in having more Foreign Service officers go
                    outside of the Department, and tell the foreign affairs story. Shultz and his
                    staff assured me that this was something they considered a high priority and
                    they felt that that the Office of Public Programs could do the job. It was an
                    office Shultz knew very well. One section of that office handled all the
                    Secretary's domestic speaking arrangements and other aspects of his domestic
                    work, not the overseas trips. Another part of it dealt with arranging
                    conferences, right from getting the rooms, to the content, to working with the
                    visitors.</p>
                <p>The main part was helping Foreign Service officers and Civil Service officers go
                    on speaking trips around the United States, both where requested and where we
                    felt it would be worthwhile, where we hadn't been in some time. My staff and I
                    met personally with Secretary Shultz perhaps many times, which I won't say was
                    the envy of the Department, but it was certainly an indication that he took very
                    seriously this role of outreach on the part of Public Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>At this time Bernie Kalb, the TV personality, had been brought into the
                    Department, and was my first boss. Actually, Kalb resigned over an issue with
                    Secretary Shultz, but resigned in good favor and politely as a gentleman. I
                    don't remember the precise issue, but that brought in Charles Redman, or Chuck
                    Redman, whom I had known and who'd actually worked with me in the Operations
                    Center. As Department spokesman and head of the Bureau of Public Affairs, he was
                    with the Secretary every day. Therefore, we had excellent feedback for the
                    programs we were developing.</p>
                <p>So in the FY 1987/1988 we had approximately 6,000 what we called events, which
                    was to say if a Foreign Service officer went to Seattle, was on a TV station,
                    talked to two universities, talked to a Rotary Club and so on, a Foreign Affairs
                    Association meeting in the evening, those were all events. We had close to
                    6,000. We hit all the states and we also utilized in a very serious way, a
                    little known but very important, amendment to Department regulations. Our Office
                    of Public Programs could be reimbursed by a sponsor for some of the activities,
                    hotel room and so on, of a Foreign Service officer or Civil Service officer
                    speaking on an established, that is on an agreed program. Otherwise for an
                    officer or for the Department to receive money would have been illegal and
                    outside the regulations. We were the only office that had this authority.</p>
                <p>What it meant was that we could send a person to San Francisco, have the way paid
                    by the Foreign Affairs Council of San Francisco, and while out there have five
                    or six other events. So, we were able to increase our budget by 75% in a sense
                    over whatthe allocation from the State Department was. Much of the expansion of
                    our activities was, in fact, at no cost to the Department. But the Department
                    was getting, or the Foreign Affairs community was getting, very good publicity.
                    This was at the time, for example, of high interest, I must say, with the
                    Vietnam overtones of our activities in Central America—El Salvador and
                    Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>There were some very heated weekends in college foreign affairs seminars when
                    some of the military officers who were assigned to the State Department went out
                    along with Foreign Service officers to participate as a panel. I think that was
                    all to the good. It elevated the confusion into some sort of orderly debate
                    where we were then able to get a lot of the information out and pamphlets and
                    guidance right into the hands of people who were trying to figure out what
                    position they would take on our activities in Central America. By no means did
                    we win all hearts and minds. On the contrary. But at least it went from a
                    one-sided shouting match against the State Department to State Department
                    participation in the program. So that I think was very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But on that... I can't remember where, but there was
                        something about almost an independent operation within the State Department
                        about informing around the United States about our Central-America
                        policies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>FRY: What happened was that in the, you might say, high moments of the debate
                    about activities in Nicaragua with the Sandinistas, the Bureau of Inter-American
                    Affairs formed a sub grouping which was not the desk and not the country
                    directors, but an office of—the exact name I forget—Central American activities.
                    They had their own speaking program, and not the kind of speaking program which
                    simply went out to the Rotary Club or to a college weekend at the University of
                    Kansas or something like that. These were people who were authorized to deal
                    almost directly with the press, and to appear often on television. We helped to
                    manage the mechanics of those appearances, but we had nothing to do with
                    choosing the sites. They were chosen by this Central American group.</p>
                <p>There was criticism of that both in funding and in other ways. It didn't really
                    affect our operation in the sense of what we were doing in Public Affairs, but
                    it was an off-shoot of a policy which was very controversial, in which the
                    Secretary of State and others wanted to have a very sharp handle on what was
                    being said about Central America. We had to have our speakers, who might be
                    going out to talk about the Soviet Union or about Japan, fully briefed on what
                    to say about Central America, if asked on a television talk show or radio
                    program, so that their position was consistent with what the State Department
                    was putting out in general and what this group in particular in the
                    Inter-American Bureau was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other elements to this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have something about you being in the UN...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes, I had begun to look for an overseas assignment as 1988 came around. It
                    wasn't clear to me then, as I was getting near the end of my time in Public
                    Affairs in the springtime, whether I would go overseas again or not. I wouldn't
                    have minded having a deputy assistant secretary job in the Department or a
                    similar ranking job. Then I was approached to see if I would be willing to join
                    the 43rd US delegation to the United Nations. My particular role would be as an
                    advisor on Soviet, Eastern European and European affairs in general. There were
                    usually three or four advisors who were made full members of the delegation and
                    had offices at US UN. The more I thought about this, the more I wanted to do it.
                    For one thing I had never really been involved in what was then Multi-Lateral
                    Diplomacy. I knew a lot about the UN, but not very much about the mechanics of
                    it. I thought that would be very interesting to do. Although you are a member of
                    the delegation for a year, the active work was roughly from the end of August
                    into January.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>So I went to the United Nations and I was given that full entree as advisor to
                    the delegation. As a member of the delegation I found it one of the most
                    rewarding and, I must say, exciting experiences of all the time that I was in
                    the Foreign Service. The reason was that when you took that job the officers at
                    USUN, including the ambassador, General Vernon Walters, assumed that you had
                    been picked because you could simply be given either an instruction or general
                    guidelines and then take it from there, as was in the case during my time with
                    the 43rd delegation. There was going to be significant change in policy on the
                    Soviet side. We wanted to cover it as closely as possible and to see where it
                    dove-tailed with other things that were happening under Gorbachev—events that
                    were taking place under perestroika and related economic matters in the Soviet
                    Union, not to mention political-military. Well, I had a good idea of what
                    glasnost in the Soviet Union was and wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of explain... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Glasnost being the idea of openness or a window that Gorbachev was opening
                    on and in Soviet society. Unfortunately, the word opening or opening of a window
                    did not mean the same thing in the Soviet society as it would in the West.
                    However, what it did mean in my interpretation of it was still a remarkable
                    change in how the Soviet Union was doing business and more importantly how it
                    was doing business overseas and in its relations at the UN. So I began right
                    from the first day trying to get to know people at the Soviet Mission and in
                    Eastern European countries.</p>
                <p>I renewed contacts with my Nordic friends, particularly Finland, who had a great
                    deal of information on what was going on. During the fall there were many events
                    where votes of interest to us were undecided. Most importantly was a very strong
                    thrust by the Russians to revamp how the UN does business, right from the
                    Military Committee to various things which are arcane to someone not familiar
                    with the mechanics of the General Assembly. It reflected a much mellower, you
                    might say, a much more open Soviet attitude towards things: on caucusing, on
                    getting together. I mean, they were asking us to lunch when that was something
                    relatively rare still. When they had delegates who came to committee meetings
                    only for one or two weeks they were seeking out American lawyers or American
                    diplomats at the UN that they had heard about and knew were interested in the
                    same subject. In other words, it was a complete change of tone.</p>
                <p>I was disappointed, when heads of State were invited to speak, at the speech of
                    President Reagan. I felt that he had a great opportunity in that year to make a
                    real statement about the relationship of the United States to the United Nations
                    in view of the rapidly changing situation in the Soviet Union. He did not do
                    this. I felt that he gave a warm and friendly speech, a little bit to the fact
                    that we would be paying some of our arrearages. But in general—since it was his
                    farewell to the UN—I did not find it up to the caliber that I was hoping for
                    from the American side.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>In contrast to that, in what was really the high point of the UN that year in
                    many ways, was the arrival of Gorbachev. He met with President Reagan and
                    then-to-be President Bush on Governor's Island. But that was preceded by a
                    speech which Gorbachev gave—this was in December and long after most people
                    expected any other senior leaders to appear at the General Assembly—a speech
                    which I thought was, if not the most impressive, one of the top five speeches I
                    had heard in my entire life in diplomacy. It was brilliantly executed. It laid
                    out a Soviet position which was quite different than anything that had been
                    expressed before. It expressed great willingness to open cooperation, even to
                    things relating to arms control and disarmament, activities in the Arctic, many
                    other facets of UN life and through UN life of diplomatic life in bilateral
                    relations, that no one really expected. People were looking to a speech that
                    would be reflective of the things that were happening in the Soviet Union, but
                    not as much as he gave. Also I would say his demeanor, the way he delivered the
                    speech, the power of his presentation, was absolutely spellbinding. It was far
                    and away the most impressive speech that was given in 1988 in the UN.</p>
                <p>My job was, of course, to listen to the speech. I had planned for some 10 or 15
                    of my colleagues, immediately at the speech's conclusion, to go out to other
                    embassies, to other delegations, to ask their impressions, to go as high as they
                    could on this. While they were doing this, I went back, wrote up the speech—I
                    knew it would be on the wire services, but I wanted to cap the highlights as
                    quickly as possible—because our President was leaving the next morning to come
                    to New York, and I wanted him to have something from the State Department.</p>
                <p>As I was finishing this sort of stream of consciousness, pouring it into the
                    Wang, into our word processor, I didn't even want to stop since my notes were
                    too sketchy to try and dictate it, go up into a secure room and all that. I just
                    blasted it out. People were coming to me and leaving these notes; the Swedish
                    say this, the Romanians say that, whatever it was. The Vatican says that. And I
                    was able to incorporate that feedback. It took about—from the time the speech
                    ended to the time the telegram was sent—two and a half hours, and I look back on
                    it as sort of the high point of yoga-concentration. I mean that I was just so
                    focused on getting this report done and making it as good as possible, that I
                    couldn't believe it was such a short time. We then worked on Gorbachev's meeting
                    with the President. USUN got kudos, not just for my report, but in general for
                    the whole handling of the visit and the overall reporting.</p>
                <p>Subsequently—and this was to my astonishment—I found out that Vice-President Bush
                    had sort of read my cable on the way up, however his advisors had given it to
                    him, and he said: “Now this is the kind of mission reporting—having been
                    ambassador at the UN—that I appreciate, because this is helpful. Now I know how
                    the speech was reflected in the opinion of others whose opinions I respect,”
                    such as the Canadian ambassador whom he knew. This was followed by my getting a
                    $5,000 Presidential Award or whatever they are called. I assumed it was for our
                    work, my colleagues and myself, on the changes in the policy of the Soviet Union
                    in that 43rd UN session of 1988-1989, and the work on the Gorbachev visit and
                    speech.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On that high note what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: When that was completed I actually went back to the UN in the early part of
                    '89, partly because they had had some illnesses in the staff. I served not so
                    much as an advisor in European affairs, but just served as a reporting officer
                    to help close out this 43rd UN session. Another thing that happened which had
                    confused the ending of the session, had made it run much later and therefore put
                    off a lot of things into the springtime, was the fact that Mr. Arafat wanted to
                    come and speak at the United Nations and we would not allow this at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is the leader of the Palestinians, the PLO...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Who was the Palestine Liberation Organization leader. And as a result, the
                    UN was very angry with the United States and we were terribly outvoted on this.
                    My dismay was registered with Ambassador Herbert Okun, who was the Deputy Chief
                    of Mission at the UN, in a photograph which appeared in Time magazine. The two
                    of us are sitting at the American desk in the General Assembly with “USA” in
                    front of us, hearing country after country lambaste the US for its
                    small-mindedness in not allowing Mr. Arafat to speak at the UN directly. The
                    look on our faces told how happy we were to be hearing all this. The UN
                    delegates, simply arose as a body, packed up, chartered planes, and flew to
                    Geneva where Arafat talked to the UN in December 1988. But this threw everything
                    in a tailspin in the month of December because it added a week and a half on to
                    the session. So anyway, I worked with the International Organizations Bureau and
                    at the UN until well into the spring.</p>
                <p>At that time I did not have an overseas assignment or a Department assignment. I
                    had made an offer previously, because of my interest in the Arctic and northern
                    areas, to get a temporary assignment, as senior officers were more and more
                    frequently allowed to do, under a program where you could do a concrete report
                    that needed doing but just had not been done. What I wanted to do was a summary
                    of how the US had been involved in the Arctic, with suggestions for what our
                    policy might be, and to explain the origin of Presidential statements on the
                    Arctic, which had been in my case President Nixon and President Reagan. The
                    reason for my suggesting this was that Gorbachev, both in his UN speech and in a
                    previous speech in 1987, had completely changed the whole policy of the Soviet
                    Union in regard to Arctic cooperation.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I knew from my friends in the Polar Affairs Office and in the European Bureau
                    that we—aside from knowing how to answer questions about nuclear-free zones
                    which had been coming up for years—were not prepared to consider the broader
                    implications of what this meant. Not just for American policy, but for NATO
                    policy: for Denmark, Norway, for Iceland, for Canada. Having a background on how
                    we got to where we were, which was simply Cold War rhetoric year after year,
                    might help in understanding what Gorbachev was suggesting. I said maybe four or
                    five months would do it into the summer. I went into the archives. The more I
                    got into it the more involved it got. It lead to some peripheral studies on
                    political-military changes in the Arctic areas, in the northern areas. It was
                    the kind of research that desk officers and country directors certainly could
                    have done if they had had the time, but of course they are always tied down to
                    day-to-day operations. So the upshot of all that was that it lasted well into
                    the fall to the end of the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were promoted during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: Yes in the fall of 1989. I had been promoted to Minister-Counselor during
                    that time and was debating then whether I would remain in the Foreign Service to
                    seek an overseas assignment, or whether I felt that as I was reaching my 55th
                    birthday, a deadline you might say—the sort of the end of the line for doing
                    something else in life. Although having been recently promoted, I decided to
                    retire in 1990, though I did some fill-in jobs during that spring working in the
                    Bureau of European Affairs and OES. Things where they just needed a senior
                    officer for a while. That led into my retirement in June of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a brief summary of what you did after you became the
                        August age of 55. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FRY: I stayed in Washington about six months after my retirement, kept my
                    security clearance, and helped on some projects both in Public Affairs and in
                    the Historian's Office. I completed a 110 page partly classified project on “US
                    Foreign Policy and International Relations in the Arctic.” That was very
                    compatible and worked out well. I had always wanted to teach and since childhood
                    I had enjoyed working with wild animals. I was trying to figure out a way how I
                    could blend both an interest, more than an interest, in the outdoors, with
                    actually working as a veterinarian-type assistant or working with wild animals
                    who had been injured, or were under scientific investigation, and then teaching
                    at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>How that was resolved was through a series of fortuitous events tying into the
                    University of Alaska in Fairbanks after I moved from DC to Olympia, Washington,
                    where I had built a home. A new graduate program at the University of Alaska
                    Fairbanks (UAF) was entitled: “Northern Studies.” They were filling out the
                    curriculum and I suggested a course called: The History of US Arctic Politics.
                    It was built in substantial measure on what I had learned both in my project in
                    the Senior Seminar and in my detail to the Historian's Office for the paper on
                    US Arctic policies. This shows that there is not only a life after the Foreign
                    Service, but it may well be an extension, in a very nice way, of the things you
                    were doing for the Department of State.</p>
                <p>I developed a course in Fairbanks with a professor who was on the faculty. We
                    taught it first in 1992. We've continued to teach it every other year, and in
                    the meantime I often lecture on parts of the course in the spring and fall.</p>
                <p>While I was in Alaska working on this program, I also started working as a
                    volunteer, that is not as a paid member of the faculty or anything, at the Large
                    Animal Research Station, which is outside of Fairbanks, but is part of the
                    Institute of Arctic Biology of the University of Alaska. As time went on, I
                    enjoyed that work more and more, became integrated into the program, learned to
                    work with Arctic animals, muskoxen, reindeer and caribou. I learned the computer
                    programs for monitoring them at certain times of the year when they are watched
                    day and night as part of a long-term nutritional, reproduction study. Between
                    the fall of 1991 and the fall of 1995, I have worked up there about three times
                    a year, sometimes as long as two months. In 1993 I traveled 600 miles on the
                    Porcupine River collecting information for a book I am writing on the survey of
                    the 141th Meridian—The Alaska-Yukon Boundary; an article on a smallpox epidemic
                    in Alaska in 1911 has been accepted by “Alaska History Magazine.” I have lots of
                    “work in progress.” In 1996 I'll be site manager for an archaeological dig on
                    the Chukchi Sea near Barrow, Alaska.</p>
                <p>My life in Olympia developed as I had hoped. I didn't know anybody when I moved
                    out there, but now I work with several civic and community affairs programs. I
                    serve on the editorial advisory panel of the “Daily Olympian,” the Gannett
                    newspaper. I'm vice president of the World Affairs Council, and the Olympia
                    Opera Guild. I work at the Olympic Wildlife Refuge Center where I began the
                    practical task of learning how to care for injured wildlife. The work I hope
                    will lead to a state license as a wildlife rehabilitator, for which near the end
                    of 1995 I had accrued about 850 hours towards the 1,000 required.So, my life
                    after the Foreign Service has been very interesting and enjoyable. However, the
                    Foreign Service itself continues to play an important role in my life because I
                    am very much involved in volunteering at the local universities, at the foreign
                    affairs community gatherings in the Puget Sound area, and contribute and help
                    arrange for speakers and am a resource myself. That has proved to be very
                    exciting. This is an area of the United States in which there is a great deal of
                    interest in foreign affairs and specifically in the Pacific Rim in relations
                    with Asia, about which I knew very little. I have been able to bring people out
                    from the State Department and to recommend programs. So it has been a nice
                    tie-in with my State career.</p>
