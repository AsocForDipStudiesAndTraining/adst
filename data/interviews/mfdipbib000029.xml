                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob, let's start at the beginning. Tell me when and where
                        you were born and something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was born in Chicago on the south side in October 1910, which makes me 90
                    years old. So, forgive me if I forget some things. My parents were married in
                    January 1910, which may say something about their knowledge of birth control,
                    since I was born in October. I am the oldest of four children. My father, Louis
                    E. Asher, was born in Jackson, Mississippi in 1877. My mother was born in
                    Karlsr�he, Germany, in 1883, and came here when she was about nine years old
                    with my grandparents. My mother died of cancer when I was nine, after a long
                    illness, and left my father with four children, aged three to nine. Fortunately,
                    although he was born in poverty, he became a very successful businessman, and
                    was able to get help to take care of the children and enable him to carry on. I
                    think all of us suffered in some psychological way from this early death of my
                    mother and from her two years of illness in the house. Doctors coming and going,
                    no loud noises from the children, and a rather gloomy atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: He was born, as I said, in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1877, the youngest of
                    five children, in a Jewish family at a time at which there probably were only a
                    half dozen Jewish families in Jackson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there were quite a few throughout the South?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, especially in Savannah, Charleston and, to a lesseextent I believe,
                    in Atlanta and New Orleans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's amazing, they were very much an integral part of
                        thcommunity.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ASHER: But they were scattered. The point I wanted to make was thamy parents
                    weren't brought up is any formally religious fashion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They couldn't get together...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: In a synagogue? I don't think so. Anyhow, my father'family moved to
                    Vicksburg very soon and then to Memphis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what his father was doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. He was peddling pharmaceuticals, some of which werdubious value.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's all we had, elixirs...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: He was apparently a dreamy person, interested in life, but not a great
                    money maker. It was my Dad's mother who had the energy and was determined that
                    her kids go to school, get an education, read books, and so on. My father was
                    told he could go to school until he was 14, so he finished high school in
                    Memphis just before his 15th birthday, with the top ranking in the Memphis
                    public school system. I have an 1892 gold medal to prove it. He loved
                    booknovels, biographies, history and poetry. Not much in art, but he was an
                    intellectual. He read voraciously and accumulated a big library. I had access to
                    the library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family, would you look upon it as coming from
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, his parents came from Germany, and my mother was born in Germany to
                    German parents. She did go to college, which is unusual. This turned out to be
                    very nice for my father and me because, as a result of her attending Armour
                    Institute, which was later folded into the University of Chicago, my father was
                    able to get good tickets to the University of Chicago football games and take me
                    to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had a great team then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. As a kid, I was able to sit in the fifty-yard linsection at local
                    football games.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your father end up in Chicago?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ASHER: He graduated from high school in Memphis. He had an older sister, ten
                    years older, who was married to a businessman in Peoria, Illinois. At the age of
                    15, Dad went to work, sweeping out the store early in the morning, putting
                    things in order at the end of the day, and so on, for this uncle of mine. He
                    hated the job. My uncle, a hard-working, successful businessman, was not exactly
                    the kind-hearted relative but a demanding boss. The first chance that Dad got,
                    he took his bicycle and rode 100 miles to Chicago, where he had another married
                    sister, with five dollars, a mandolin and a lead that he thought might get him a
                    job as a journalist. He got a job with a magazine, I've forgotten the name of
                    it, it died a long time ago, but it specialized in doing puffed up stories on
                    the big businessmen in Chicago, where fortunes were being made in steel,
                    railroads, meat-packing and merchandising. Early in his career, Dad was able to
                    obtain an interview with Richard Sears, the president and chief guiding spirit
                    of a new mail-order company, Sears Roebuck. Mr. Sears liked the interview so
                    much that he ordered 10,000 reprints to be sent out to customers and offered my
                    father a job in what was then the correspondence department. There it was not
                    just “your order has been received and mailed.” Lonely farmers poured out their
                    hearts to Sears. They told Sears about their sick cows, their mothers-in-law,
                    their corn crops, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a vital institution for farmers and people living
                        outhere. They didn't have radio or anything like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That's right. They really looked to Sears Roebuck to give them advice and
                    answers. It was a fascinating exposure to problems of ordinary people in the
                    U.S. From correspondent, Dad was soon made advertising manager and in that
                    capacity he put out the first free mail order catalogue in this country. Up
                    until then, Sears and Montgomery Ward had charged for their catalogues. It was a
                    big thing. Dad and Mr. Sears had this idea o“Send no money, get a free
                    catalogue.” That was extremely successful and became the norm for mail-order
                    companies.</p>
                <p>Dad worshiped Richard Sears, who had great charisma, and soon made him general
                    manager of this upcoming business. In about 1908, Mr. Sears left and Julius
                    Rosenwald became his successor. There was some tension between Mr. Sears anMr.
                    Rosenwald. Sears was the great innovator, the great imaginer, the bold
                    entrepreneur. Rosenwald was a much more cautious person, who had come through
                    the clothing business to the point where Sears Roebuck owed him a lot of money.
                    My father left at about the same time as Richard Sears, and established his own
                    mail-order clothing business. It was quite successful until the Great Depression
                    killed the mail-order clothing business. But I think it was dying before then,
                    thanks to the automobile, the proliferation of urban centers, and the ease of
                    obtaining suits, coats and dresses in standard sizes from accessible retail
                    stores</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's background of your mother, and how did your parents
                        meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ASHER: I think through a mutual friend, but I honestly don't know. They were
                    mature by the standards of those years. My father was 33 when they got married,
                    my mother was 28.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother, you say, was born in Karlsruhe. What was her
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: They were intellectuals, some of them were in banking. A great uncle had
                    established the Frankfurter Zeitung. Her father brought the family to the USA in
                    about 1890. Because he had good contacts in Germany, he was able to establish a
                    novelty business in Chicago. He imported more than pin-cushions and sewing
                    equipment; also humidors, smoking equipment, napkin rings, that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they also from a Jewish community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. They were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she have a sort of a religious thing or are we talking
                        aboupretty secular people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Entirely secular. I think my father was an assimilationist. Israel
                    Zangwill's “The Melting Pot,” published in 1910, influenced the family and none
                    thought of themselves as limited to the Jewish community, although most of their
                    friends were Jewish and they knew that they couldn't buy property in certain
                    areas or belong to anything but Jewish clubs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about German community? Was there much of a
                        tie...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Well, there were relatives in Germany and a tie which brought some strains
                    into the family in World War One. My grandfather read German. He read English,
                    too, but he subscribed to the Abend Post, which was Chicago's evening German
                    paper. At that time my grandmother had died, too, and my grandfather was living
                    with us. It was an obvious irritation to my patriotic father to see that German
                    newspaper in Grandpa's hands. I was just a kid then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was also some anti-German... I know because my
                        grandfather came from the '48er group and ended up as a very young man, he
                        came out of the Civil War, his name was Franz Lackner, and was a lawyer in
                        Chicago at the time. Here he was, a Civil War veteran of some distinction
                        and all, and people were giving them a rough time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ASHER: My father's father had been in the quartermaster corps in the Civil War,
                    on the southern side. I think he came over in 1848. Aside from the deaths of my
                    mother and grandparents, I really had a very privileged childhood. Although at
                    the time of my birth my parents were living in an apartment, they moved to a
                    house soon after that. I was brought up in houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't happen to know a couple of kids named Leopold
                        and Loewere friends of yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was going to come to that, but I can give it to you now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, I am trying to gather, what was it
                        like? Obviously, your mother was gone before you were fairly old. Were there
                        around the dinner table times when there was talk about the world, or was
                        your father business oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: No, he was glad to be away from business. He wrote beautifully, he was
                    very witty, he read omnivorously, and he was interested in the whole world. He
                    was Treasurer or Secretary of something called The Book and Play Club, which put
                    on plays and invited poets and novelists to speak at their meetings. He made
                    friends with a number of the leading writers of the period. Edna St. Vincent
                    Millay stayed with us when she was in Chicago, and a writer who is not as well
                    known now, Ludwig Lewisohn, dedicated one of his autobiographical volumes,
                    “Mid-Channel,” to my father who was a good friend and benefactor of Ludwig's.
                    Other literary figures were known to us and seem to have enjoyed staying at our
                    house.</p>
                <p>The only mishap that I can recall occurred when a woman pianist was staying with
                    us, and my 10 or 11-year old sister wanted to show the VIP how strong she was by
                    opening the clenched right-hand fist of the pianist. My sister's show of
                    strength succeeded in cracking a finger bone of the pianist, thereby bringing
                    that concert tour to a premature end and causing my father great anguish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course Chicago during that time was a hotbed of
                        intellectualife. But how about you? Were you sitting at the table
                        listening...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes and no. At first, the children were fed earlier and senoff to bed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “kinder tisch.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Exactly. When my parents or my grandparents wanted us not thear, they said
                    “Nicht f�r die kinder,” and spoke in German.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I got that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: And that was a signal to listen carefully and pick up as many words as we
                    could. We all sort of learned — my oldest sister and I — I had two sisters and
                    one brother, some German, mostly from what we were not supposed to hear. But the
                    conversation at the table did involve books. My father was pretty strict, you
                    had to get your home work done before you could come to dinner. I was privileged
                    to go to private schools and at one such school, I went from first grade through
                    my freshman year. It was the Harvard School for Boys, a small school, very good
                    at giving you a solid background in reading, writing, arithmetic, geography,
                    spelling and Latin. Not very good in awakening your interests in music, art, or
                    athletics. I got my athletics at summer camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am surprised, I would have thought that music would have
                        been...Were the family musical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: My mother played the piano but when I became seven she was no longer able
                    to. Music wasn't as important as poetry. My father frequently read poetry to us.
                    We had a couple of famous relatives who were poets, way back on the family tree.
                    On my father's side there was Heinrich Heine, and my maternal grandmother's
                    sister was a very well known poet in Germany who has recently been undergoing a
                    big revival, Else Lasker-Sch�ler. I am the last living relative who knew her in
                    person, so I get calls about her from time to time because there have been major
                    exhibits of her work and several books about her published. I had lunch the day
                    before yesterday with a professor at the University of Massachusetts, who is the
                    greatest living expert on my great aunt. My younger sister wrote poetry and
                    published a couple of volumes. My other sister is a painter and poet and married
                    to the current poet-laureate Stanley Kunitz. So poetry has been big in our
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I've never written any. I love good poetry, I read a lot of it. Just
                    keeping up with my family keeps me moderately busy. I have no gift for writing
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were going through a relatively strict school,
                        werthere any subjects that particularly peaked your interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, I was much more interested in English, English literature,
                    composition, than in math, for example. But the school was rigid enough and
                    strict enough to more or less force you to do equally well in everything. So I
                    got good grades and I don't know what happened to most of my classmates, but one
                    classmate was a youngster named Bobby Franks. He became, by virtue of being
                    murdered in a case called “The Crime of the Century,” a figure in history books.
                    Don't know if he would have been otherwise.</p>
                <p>I was the class president that freshman year and therefore got involved very
                    early in the case as a good friend of Bobby Franks, who at first appeared to
                    have been kidnaped for ransom. I knew Dick Loeb and my sister was in a birding
                    class led by Nathan Leopold. They'd go into parks and suburbs looking for
                    uncommon birds, and Nathan Leopold was the expert, pointing out to these
                    youngsters recognizable differences between birds they saw. On the Saturday
                    before the murder, Dick Loeb came by and we tossed a ball for a while. He was
                    four or five years older than I. He said, “You ought to come out and see some
                    real ball games sometime.” And I said, “Where?” And he said, “At the University
                    next week.” I said, “I don't have any way to get there.” To which he replied, “I
                    could give you a lift.” I said, “Thank you.” But the next Wednesday, when I got
                    home from my dentist appointment, I got a call from Mrs. Franks asking whether I
                    knew where her son was. He was normally home by that time. It was 5:30, six
                    o'clock. I said, I didn't know because I had left school at three o'clock,
                    whatever time we got out, and had gone downtown to the dentist. But I would try
                    to find out for her. And I established the fact that he left school around 3:30,
                    as far as anyone knew, walking south from 47th Street to his home on 51st Street
                    and should presumably have been home by the time she had called. What had
                    happened came out later. It was that he had been picked up by Loeb and Leopold
                    in their car. They were looking for any eligible young person of the group that
                    they knew at Harvard school, including, as they later said, Junie (Sam) Harris,
                    me, Johnny Coleman, Bobby Franks. They really weren't particular. But Bobby
                    Franks came along at the right time, apparently with a tennis racket in hand,
                    and they said they wanted to see him and his racket. He took the ride and it
                    cost him his life. Smashed on the head. They later tried to extract a ransom and
                    it was some days before they were actually caught.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, they had written a ransom note on a typewriter, and I was asked to
                    find out what kind of typewriters we had at school. I was interviewed by the
                    police. That really taught me a lesson I have never forgotten, because I was
                    taken down to the central office and they would say to me, “Now, your gym
                    teacher, was he a friendly man?” And I would say, thinking I was being kind,
                    “Oh, yes, very friendly.” “Would he ever put his arm around you?” “Oh, yes. If
                    you struck out or fumbled a ball or something, he would put his arm around you
                    and tell you it was okay.” “Get that gym teacher down here for questioning” said
                    the police officer, thinking my comment might prove a homosexual relationship.”
                    Then he said, “Your manual training teacher, was he friendly?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the thrust of what they were...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. And I said, “Oh, yes, he would go out with us on Halloween and our
                    parents were satisfied that we were under some kind of control. We rang
                    door-bells, soaped windows, and so on.” “Get that manual training teacher down
                    here!” And pretty soon I began to wake up to the fact that I was going to have
                    the whole faculty in jail unless I shut up. So I became more discreet, after
                    they started questioning me also about our male English teacher. But the lesson
                    it taught me was that just by virtue of being questioned, these innocent people
                    had things brought out in the newspapers, the Hearst Press in particular, but
                    the Chicago Tribune and other papers as well, that marked them for life. If they
                    had had a divorce, it raised questions in some quarters about should they be
                    teaching, that sort of thing. And what I learned was, be careful what you say
                    when you are being grilled.</p>
                <p>I was told by my father not to talk to any press people, but there was a “boy
                    reporter”— he had been a “boy reporter” for about 10 years — with the Hearst
                    Papers in Chicago, named Horace Wade, who came to our house in knee pants with
                    his parents, though it was obvious that he shaved regularly and was a bit more
                    then a boy. He wanted to interview me. I said I would not be able to talk to
                    him, and he said, “Well, I just talked to Dick Loeb, do you want to check with
                    him?” I called Dick Loeb and he said, “Oh, yes, he is alright, you can talk to
                    him.” Loeb and Leopold were brazen. So I gave him a little interview about Bobby
                    Franks and what a nice boy he was.</p>
                <p>Then, some days later the story came out. Leopold's eyeglasses were found in a
                    culvert, the prescription was traced to Almer Coe, a well-known optometrist in
                    Chicago, and, through them, to Nathan Leopold. The police got Leopold down and
                    he said he had been with Loeb that day. They seemed to have a good enough alibi,
                    but in fact it was broken and they confessed. Their motive apparently was to
                    commit a perfect murder, get away with it, and see if they could, in addition,
                    collect a $10,000 ransom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am trying to remember, was it Leopold who was the
                        driving forcbehind it, or was it Loeb? One of those was stronger, if
                        I...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I thought it was Leopold in terms of brain-power and dark thoughts. Dick
                    Loeb was a handsome, charming guy. They were both brilliant and they had
                    finished college. I think one of the problems was that they were exposed to
                    courses in abnormal psychology and other adult subjects when they were still
                    children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nietzsche, super-man, “you can do anything” sort
                        of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ASHER: That's right, if you were determined to. And here they were 18, 19 years
                    old, thinking they could do anything, including committing a perfect murder.
                    And, as in almost all such murders, something comes out. Perpetrators are
                    caught. Their families were very prominent, very well to do. In my neighborhood,
                    our backyard almost touched the Loeb's tennis court. We thought this was
                    wonderful because Dick Loeb and his siblings had been instructed that, if there
                    were other kids in the neighborhood who were playing on the Loeb court, they
                    didn't have the right to send them home, they had to wait their turn. This was
                    supposed to be evidence of how well brought up they were, but obviously,
                    something went wrong. It may have been in letting them go through school too
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where they graduates of the Harvard School, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I am pretty sure Nathan Leopold was. As for Dick Loeb, I know his younger
                    brother Tommy was in my brother's class at Harvard School, so I guess both of
                    them were. Dick had gone to the University of Michigan, and they both were at
                    the University of Chicago in graduate school at the time of the murder.</p>
                <p>I shifted to the University High School after my freshman year. Not because of
                    the murder but because my father thought the time had come for me to go to a
                    different school. I was certainly willing to try a co-educational school. I
                    loved it. It was the laboratory school of the University of Chicago, now known
                    as the Lab School. Then it was called the University High School. It was peopled
                    largely by sons and daughters of faculty members of the University of Chicago.
                    And it operated under the philosophy of John Dewey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Hutchins there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: He wasn't there yet. I later got to know him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the Leopold-Loeb case. How did this hit you all at
                        thschool?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ASHER: It was devastating. No school for few days. This was in May of 1924, and
                    the school annual was already in press, but a page on Bobby Franks was hastily
                    inserted. There was additional turnover of teachers. The school stayed in
                    business, but for a few years, it must have been pretty hard to get new
                    students. It was a small school, so fewer students in the first years would have
                    hurt them badly. Struggling principals and professors used to arrive in old Ford
                    cars from suburbs such as Morgan Park, teach several courses, and so forth. It
                    couldn't help but hit the school badly. The school was accustomed to getting its
                    graduates into the Ivy League schools, and more or less trained them for that. I
                    guess it continued to be able to do that, but as I say, I transferred to another
                    school and enjoyed the change. The University High School was liberating in a
                    sense. It had clubs of all kinds: a Writers Club, a French Club, an Engineering
                    Club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, I hate to dwell, but I might add for anybody who is
                        looking at this, there is vast amount of literature on the Leopold-Loeb
                        case, as it is known. The lawyer, Clarence Darrow, who was probably the most
                        famous lawyer of the 20th century, who defended them and got them life
                        sentences. You must have been following the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I should say! Nobody could take those newspapers away from us. The court
                    case was of real interest. I was a pall bearer at Bobby Frank's funeral and Mrs.
                    Franks, who was an ardent Christian Scientist, later sent me a little nicely
                    inscribed Christian Science book. My recollection is that Dick Loeb was at the
                    funeral, an innocent looking, neighborhood friend. There was a big turn-out from
                    the neighborhood. Clarence Darrow's whole effort was to prevent his clients from
                    being hung, and get them life imprisonment instead. For Leopold, life in prison
                    meant 30 years of so, during which he did a number of fairly original things, in
                    building up libraries for prisoners, teaching courses and making life more
                    interesting for them. He was finally released to go to Puerto Rico, where he was
                    a social worker for a while. He was already pretty sick by then and didn't live
                    for long. Dick Loeb was killed in a prison brawl, maybe in 1933 or '34, which
                    sounded to me like a homosexual brawl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to University High School, you mention it was based
                        oDewey's principle, could you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ASHER: I think John Dewey, originally from Columbia University, did a stretch in
                    Chicago when the University was being established, and was very influential and
                    pragmatic. His educational philosophy was to interest the students and then
                    proceed, deepening and widening their interests, so that if you had music
                    ability or wanted to learn more about instruments, musicians, and so on, you
                    were encouraged to do so at the University High School. You were discouraged at
                    Harvard, because arithmetic and grammar and geography were considered basic and
                    more important, and you could worry about your music later. We had a pretty
                    talented group of youngsters at U. High, with wide interests, access to the
                    University library, and so on. It was easier I thought, as far as demands on the
                    students were concerned, because they didn't require as much homework and
                    compulsory courses. I was graduated at the top of the class of 125 and I don't
                    think I worked half as hard as I did when I was in grammar school, but I had a
                    wonderful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the most important thing at that time, girls?
                        Did thecross your radar at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I should say they did. That was one of the big differences, you had girls
                    in the classroom. Same with clubs. I fell in love with the most beautiful girl
                    in the class but I was too shy to tell her so. And because everybody else was in
                    love with her too, it wasn't until 50 years after graduation, when it occurred
                    to me that we ought to have a reunion — we had never had one — that I got her
                    name. She had married a classmate who had died, and I wrote to her and told her
                    that I was in Washington and had gotten her address from my brother-in-law, and
                    now I could tell her how much I loved her in high school, since we both married
                    other people. And would she be willing to undertake, with whatever help I could
                    give her from Washington, to call a reunion of the class? And she did. She wrote
                    back a very nice letter, after she had talked to me 50 minutes on the telephone
                    first. We became pretty good friends in working on the reunion. She wasn't the
                    only girl at U. High. There were other girls that were interesting. One
                    afternoon a week our gym class was devoted to social dancing, that was great. It
                    was a very respectable period for high school relations between boys and girls.
                    Going to movies and holding hands was about as much as you would do. A peck on
                    the cheek maybe and, after several dates, maybe a little “necking,” as it was
                    called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In clubs and other activities, what particularly
                        interested you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ASHER: You mean, in addition to girls? I was member of the Writers Club, I was on
                    tennis squad, I was the business manager of the Annual. In retrospect, though I
                    didn't realize it at the time, there was some evidence that Jews weren't fully
                    accepted at the school, although they were there in substantial numbers. One
                    reason I say that is because the editor of the yearbook and the business manager
                    were named by the faculty adviser. They were not elected. For the four years
                    that I can remember, they had only Jewish business managers and not a single
                    Jewish editor. Although given my academic record and so on, it was just as clear
                    that I could have been named editor instead of business manager. In fact, I had
                    no talents for business management and no real interest, although I accepted the
                    assignment as a kind of honor and I worked hard at it. I think the record sort
                    of indicates that the authorities believed the school wasn't ready for a Jewish
                    editor.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you who was in the class behind me; it was Edward Levi, who later
                    became Dean of the Law School, President of the University, Attorney General of
                    the U.S., and so on. He was a good friend of mine, a very sensitive young man.
                    He started his own literary magazine at high school when he wasn't named editor
                    of the yearbook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any development, anti-Semitism may be too
                        strong a word, but a concern about Jewishness after Leopold-Loeb, since both
                        of them came from a Jewish family? I thought this might have raised...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It did, it raised sensitivity levels pretty high, particularly in the
                    Jewish community. This was terrible. Even going so far as to say, fortunately it
                    was a Jewish boy that got murdered. This was a kind of thought that went through
                    the community. They figured anti-Semitism would have been stimulated if two rich
                    Jewish boys had murdered a Christian.</p>
                <p>I don't think that I suffered any discrimination in my whole later life. My
                    father said to me “A number of children in your high-school class have parents
                    who are members of the South Shore Country Club. The South Shore Country Club
                    does not take Jews, Catholics or Blacks, and I wouldn't want you to go there,
                    particularly to mislead your friends by accepting an invitation.” Hence I knew
                    that there would be parties to which I wouldn't be invited or wouldn't go if
                    invited. At school there were groups within groups, in which Jewish boys and
                    girls seemed to have their own friends. The resultant criticism was analogous to
                    that now made of blacks in colleges: that they stay together. But they know each
                    other, their families know each other. And they feel comfortable together.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course, you mention the Catholics. It's hard, you
                        go back to that era, the Catholics were also considered out of the
                        mainstream. I remember as a kid and a teenager, going under the general
                        admonition, it is okay to date a Catholic girl, but you wouldn't want to
                        marry one. Because then you would have to raise your children as Catholics.
                        My son now is married to a Catholic girl, and I am glad they are married.
                        But it's a different world. It's not quite as so black and white as one
                        might think. People were in different groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: And the whole Catholic issue was a big one in the 1928 election. When
                    Alfred Smith ran for president, my father voted for him. There was a heavy
                    Catholic vote in Chicago, but Al Smith was the loser to Herbert Hoover. I
                    remember the campaign, there were numerous questions raised by Smith's
                    Catholicism, long before JFK became a candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within your group, and maybe at your family dinner table
                        and all, did the state of Chicago political machine, it was Bath House so
                        and so and Hicky Dick and so and so, and Big Bill Thompson...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: He was a terrible crook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one that volunteered to smash King George on the
                        nose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: On the snout. It certainly was a source of embarrassment to my father, who
                    was a progressive, good government person, with a strong civic sense of duty,
                    and he wasn't happy until Illinois got Governor Henry Horner in 1932 or
                    thereabouts in a democratic sweep. Big Bill Thompson was a Republican. Governor
                    Horner had been a judge and came in with clean credentials and actually ran a
                    pretty good state as far as I know. Politics was prominent in our home
                    discussions. My father, although a business-man, subscribed to The Nation, The
                    New Republic, The Literary Digest, Poetry, and other magazines. The Literary
                    Digest suffered its virtual demise in 1932 when their poll predicted that Hoover
                    would be re-elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought it was 1936 when they predicted Landon, I maybe
                        wrong, but I think it was 1936 when they called people and they didn't
                        realize that people who didn't have telephones did vote. In those days not
                        everybody had telephone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. I thought it was '32. Anyhow, they also forecast Hoover
                    overwhelmingly and for the same reason. They didn't realize that people who
                    didn't subscribe to The Literary Digest and who didn't have telephones did vote.
                    And voted heavily for Roosevelt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate from high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ASHER: 1927.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, you were right at the cusp of the real
                        problems of 1929. Did you feel that you were a part, as we are today, of
                        pretty good times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. Definitely. I think the 1920s may have left a number of people
                    behind, just as the present prosperity has, but the notion was that those were
                    boom times. The stock market was way up in the post-World War One years, the
                    1920s. The feeling was that people were going to be able to live comfortably
                    forever. The stock market began tumbling in October 1929. It was a terrible
                    shock, resulting in wholesale unemployment and breadlines. Devastating to many
                    families. I don't think my father had any purchases on margin, he was pretty
                    cautious with his finances, so that I could go to Dartmouth College after high
                    school, and spend three years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What prompted you to go from Chicago, you were sort of
                        under the wing of the University of Chicago, and all of a sudden off you go
                        to Dartmouth, which was also an all male college at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Well, this was a period, at least in our circle, in which the youngsters
                    didn't have the vote. Their parents made these decisions. My father had made a
                    trip east on which he had visited a nephew of his who was at Harvard, and sons
                    of friends who were at Yale, and at Dartmouth. At Dartmouth, two people from
                    Chicago, whose families we knew, took him around and evidently made him think
                    this was a wonderful, quiet, rustic place for someone like me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: One of the people who showed him around later became my brother-in-law, by
                    marrying my younger sister. Obviously he had made an impression on my father
                    before that. So Dad sort of said, “Dartmouth is the place for you.” Dartmouth
                    had been in Chicago in 1924, to play the University of Chicago, the historic tie
                    football game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the coach at University of Chicago at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ASHER: Amos Alonzo Stagg, the grand old man of football. I knew his son. He was
                    at the University High School. Stagg was a great coach. He was one of the breed,
                    no longer in existence, of coaches who thought that playing the game decently
                    and cleanly was more important than winning or losing, and the result was a lot
                    of winning teams. He went on from Chicago to coach some Pacific Coast team until
                    he was 100 years old. Some relatively small school but he again turned out great
                    football teams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all Chicago fans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Sure. I think so. We lived within walking distance of the stadium and of
                    the University. It cast a big shadow over the intellectuals in the area. I think
                    the first choice was do you stay at home or do you go away to college? Going
                    away was thought to be a good idea. Break the umbilical cord. And go east was
                    the norm, rather than to go west, and Dartmouth was an eastern Ivy League
                    college. The principal of our high school, University High, told my father I'd
                    have no trouble getting in, since I had number one ranking in the class. I went
                    to Dartmouth. I wasn't crazy about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there just for three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: 1927-1930. I had three years of good academic training and I met an old
                    friend there. I knew him before I went, because he was a University High School
                    graduate named Maurice Mandelbaum, and we roomed together in my sophomore year.
                    He later became president of the American Philosophical Association. He was a
                    philosophy major and dear friend, somewhat of a role model, although I wasn't a
                    philosophy major. He was two years ahead of me. At the end of my junior year, he
                    was already in graduate school and was going abroad for a year. I persuaded my
                    father that it would be just great if I went with him. We enrolled in the
                    University of Berlin in the fall of 1930.</p>
                <p>I had been at Dartmouth long enough to get a Phi Beta Kappa key, but after the
                    year in Europe I didn't have any desire to go back there. I finished at the
                    University of Chicago and got my master's degree at Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to Dartmouth a bit. When you got there,
                        could you describe the campus at that time, in the academic world, and then
                        student life there at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ASHER: The campus was beautiful in the autumn of 1927. They still had hazing of
                    freshmen. Not very brutal, but making us go to the first football game in
                    brassieres and panties, that sort of stuff. A select group of students, most of
                    whom were better disciplined than I was, had good work habits because they had
                    been to prep-schools, whereas I had been to this modern high school where they
                    didn't make you do things you didn't want to do. Joining a fraternity in your
                    freshman year was prohibited. So we lived in dormitories, and I remember feeling
                    very friendly with virtually all of the freshmen, particularly the people in our
                    dormitory. And I felt quite let down when they all at the end of their freshman
                    year pledged to different fraternities and nobody except one Jewish fraternity
                    invited me to join. I didn't particularly want to join that, and non-fraternity
                    men were certainly a minority at Dartmouth in those days. Fraternity life was
                    important, it became the social life of those people I thought were good friends
                    of mine. They didn't cut me or anything...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were just otherwise involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. This automatically threw the Jewish students more or less together.
                    More than they would have been, had they been pledged to different fraternities.
                    We Chicago Jews at Dartmouth kept in close touch with each other. I, as I said,
                    roomed in my sophomore year with a fellow I knew both from camp in childhood and
                    from the University High School, a very good student, who made a name for
                    himself in philosophy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you studying at Dartmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was studying English literature. I was in the English honors group my
                    junior year. Lots of reading and writing before I went abroad, and I was, and
                    still am, a slow reader. Going abroad, we had very little money but we used it
                    sparingly and got along fine. Spent the summer in France, Belgium and Holland,
                    in little towns, settling down there for days, meeting people, and staying at
                    cheap pensions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a part of a program or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ASHER: No, we just decided if we were going to go to the University of Berlin in
                    the fall — we didn't realize at the time that universities in Europe don't open
                    until about November 1st — that we had better get over there and see some of
                    Europe before we had to start school. We both had enough French to get along. We
                    had a marvelous year, what they call a Wanderjahr in German, seeing small towns
                    in Europe. Paris was about the only major French city we stayed in. Most of the
                    time we were in rural areas, Normandy, Brittany, the Pyrenees, and so on. Got to
                    the University of Berlin in September, enrolled, and discovered to our delight,
                    that we could get immediately the student identification cards that permitted
                    holders to get tickets at half price or less at Stadttheaters, museums, and
                    railroad ticket offices. We really had six weeks in which to enjoy the cultural
                    life of Berlin without any responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you picking up German?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. We signed up promptly with a teacher. I had had somexposure in my
                    family and two years of German in college, and</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Nicht f�r die kinder,” so you picked up some.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. In Berlin, I carefully chose lecture courses, rather than courses in
                    which I would have to participate. Although in one of the art courses, the
                    professor took us around the major gallery in Berlin, the Kaiser Friedrich
                    Museum, for some enlightening discussions of the works there. The year abroad
                    really opened my eyes to art and to foreign literature, and interested me in
                    them. In Belgium and the Netherlands, I had fallen in love with Flemish art and
                    I loved going to art museums.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is at time of great political turmoil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, we were exposed to a little of that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about what you were observing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. We started asking people about this man Hitler, whose name was
                    already known in Germany, he had gotten 14% of the vote in 1930...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the NSDP, National Socialist Democratic
                        Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, it was his party actually, it wasn't just a vote for Hitler. We asked
                    everyone should this affect our enrollment and so forth, and they all said, “In
                    the country of Goethe and Schiller, Hitler will never get anywhere.” The fact is
                    that we were talking to the wrong people. We were willing to believe most of
                    what we heard, although Hitler continued to make headway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is '30-'31?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. In our political science class, a big lecture course, students
                    grouped themselves more or less in relation to their political beliefs. This was
                    new to me. Communists sat on the far left, socialists next to them, but they
                    didn't get along at all. Catholic parties over in the center, right wing parties
                    on the right side. Beginning early in the course, those who objected to or
                    differed from what the professor was saying scraped their feet, those who agreed
                    applauded. He never could satisfy his whole audience, so there was always this
                    scraping of feet and applause, which made it hard for me to hear what the
                    teacher was trying to say. The lecture room was on a sort of English basement
                    level and there was a big window at the back. One day I turned around and there
                    was quite a bit of excitement, a quarrel going on, and I turned just in time to
                    see some centrist student heaved out of the window by Nazis, or by the right
                    wing group. Nazis thought of themselves as a socialist party, but were really
                    royalists very far to the right. Anyhow, this shut down the class for that day.
                    The victim wasn't greatly injured, because the window was only a few feet above
                    the ground. But it was an indication of how seriously politics was taken by
                    students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where as an American did you sit? Right in middle, 50-yard
                        line,or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, I plopped myself somewhere in the middle. I had a few socialist
                    friends, and my great aunt, the poet and artist that I mentioned, Else
                    Lasker-Sch�ler, was pretty far to the left, but we were sort of centrist. My
                    roommate didn't take the same course, I was there on my own. We didn't have to
                    pass exams, I wasn't trying for any scholarship, ours was a year of learning.
                    Wonderful. The news from home, economic news and the news in Germany were, of
                    course, terrible. The depression was really being felt. Germany was suffering
                    before, it hadn't recovered from the wild inflation that followed World War I. I
                    remember my great aunt was really in rags, happy if I could treat her to a
                    sausage or something.</p>
                <p>One thing that surprised me when I first went to the University of Berlin, the
                    very first day everybody had a full briefcase. I couldn't imagine how they knew
                    what books and papers to bring to the class. It turned out at lunchtime that
                    they all had sausages and sandwiches and what not in the briefcase and that was
                    what filled it up. I didn't know, I had to go to a nearby coffee shop, learning
                    only later that you could stash sandwiches into your briefcase.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed later when I was sent to Germany as an enlisted
                        man in early '50s, I used to wonder what all the workers were carrying in
                        all there briefcases. We think of the briefcases being... this was made for
                        executives. Of course it's the way you carry your food.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An awful lot of politics was going on in the beer halls.
                        Did yoget into that, the beer-hall culture at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. We went to Munich for Christmas, and that was sort of a center of
                    Nazi activities. We went to have a beer in a pub that we thought looked good. A
                    waiter came up after we had been there and had one beer and were willing to
                    order another. He said, “You have to leave at eight o'clock.” We said, “Why? We
                    want the beer, we are not through in here.” And he said, “The Nazi party is
                    having a meeting here, and we are clearing out the place.” We were docile enough
                    to go, or maybe smart enough to go. And we did. Sure enough, it filled up with
                    Nazis. Only a few were in any kind of uniform. What they discussed I don't know.
                    There were also Nazi sympathizers at the University, though very few. The Nazis
                    had a big cleansing job before they could be in full power. This occurred a
                    couple of years after we left Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have to worry, sort of, about the rowing gangs
                        ostorm troopers, or the equivalence, SA, anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Not in 1930/31. It might have been quite different in 193or 1933.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the inflation, what were you seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It was terrible. Devastating in its effects. Made living cheap for us,
                    because the dollar was great. You put hundred dollars into a bank there and you
                    could withdraw marks for several months. You could also carry a big wad of paper
                    money. It was a little more stable by 1929. The worst inflation was earlier in
                    the 1920s. But the poverty was great. It was fertile soil for demagogues.
                    Germany thought of itself as this great enlightened country, but the thinkers
                    were a small minority. They were less observant than they thought. I did find it
                    hard to believe that Hitler came into power almost legitimately. And we had to
                    get all our relatives out of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing your relatives there? You were seeing your
                        aunand all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ASHER: I had other relatives, my stepmother's. My father remarried in 1929. My
                    stepmother's sister was still in Germany, a ranking tennis player and
                    psychoanalyst. My father brought her, some more distant relatives of mine, and
                    some needy strangers to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, were you at all sort of plugged in into the
                        Jewiscommunity in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any of the students talking about, “Boy, wait to see
                        what's coming down the road...” Did you have a feeling that a storm was
                        approaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. Because we found, I can't remember through what contact, probably
                    some relative, a German family who were willing to take in me and my room-mate
                    as boarders. They had some extra space, having evidently had a sizable apartment
                    before economic circumstances required them to take us in. And they were
                    terribly worried about what was going to happen. I think Maurie and I thought
                    maybe they were a little bit hysterical, but they were dead right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they Jewish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. They had a son about our age, a little older, who had some minor job
                    somewhere and a daughter who worked for a Jewish dentist as a
                    secretary/appointments person. They were never heard of after the war, so I
                    suppose they were killed by the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1931?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The end of the first semester in 1931. Went to Italy anthere we
                    encountered fascism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was going to say, let's talk a little about Italy.
                        Did you feel you were... you know, sun and all, was that kind of fun at
                        first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Again, as students, it was wonderful. We went to galleries and cathedrals
                    and small towns and got around easily. It wasn't a Jewish family that put us up,
                    but our landlords warned us not to talk about Mussolini in public, not to be
                    heard talking, especially saying anything derogatory, because it was dangerous
                    to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, at that point, it wasn't anti-Semitism, you
                        didn't meswith Il Duce.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That's right. At least that's my impression of what it was. And we were
                    introduced to a different kind of social life. When I asked the daughter of a
                    man we had met whether she would like to play tennis with me, she said yes and
                    we made a date to meet at four o'clock at the tennis court. To my surprise, her
                    mother was there, and her brother, all chaperones. It was a different kind of
                    social life. Germany was pretty liberated. The girls there were quite
                    forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Germany, particularly Berlin, one always
                        thinks of sort of the period there was a very solid, nice decadent element
                        to Berlin life which for a young student I think would have been great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It was. We were very fortunate. A classmate of Maurie's two years ahead of
                    me but I knew him from Dartmouth, was at the University of Berlin, or had he
                    just finished there? He later became a New York Times correspondent and a fairly
                    distinguished one. A biography of him has just been published by Princeton U.
                    Press. He had a girlfriend, whom he later married, who was a daughter of a
                    German play-write. The divorced wife of the play-write, who was the girl's
                    mother, ran a sort of salon, to which we were invited and gladly entered. If
                    Shep Stone hadn't been in love with this daughter, I could have been. She was
                    beautiful and was good company. Her great charm, I thought, was in her looks and
                    friendliness and so forth. There was also a very liberated Norwegian girl. But I
                    was carrying the torch for a girl in Chicago, who was at Swarthmore at the time.
                    So I was social but not ready to commit myself to anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Six weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's also little difficult, I was thinking for Americans,
                        to take politics of another country, particularly a college student, not
                        terribly seriously and have a couple of beers and get up and imitate either
                        Hitler or Mussolini or something. Did you have to worry about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, we were certainly warned of that, and knew enough to keep quiet. But,
                    I am going back to Berlin for a moment if I may. My great aunt, Else
                    Lasker-Sch�ler, took me to the opening of a movie based on Erich Remarque's
                    book, “Im West Nichts Neues,” a movie made that year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is still played on TV again and again, it is

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: While we were at the opening night of the movie, a stink bomb was
                    unleashed, a powerful one, in the movie, and we all had to clear out.
                    Undoubtedly set off by some right wing Nazi kind of people who did not want to
                    see this peace-oriented film take hold in Germany. We were cleared out onto the
                    streets, waiting for the place to be aired. All I can remember is how outraged
                    my great aunt was. The “frechheit” (insolence) as she called it, of these people
                    who objected to a movie, and gave vent to their objection by trying to prevent
                    other people from seeing it! She was communist oriented in some economic ways
                    but she was a true democrat in the sense that she thought people ought to be
                    able to express themselves freely. If they wanted to go to a movie they should
                    be entitled to see it. And not to be ousted by a fanatic with a stink bomb. That
                    was an exposure I remember distinctly.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Yes, but many were dressed in gray. There were black-shirted men, but they
                    didn't parade as black-shirts. Mussolini was in charge and he was able to
                    station people all over the place. Rome was well policed by uniformed guardsmen
                    who were being trained for new conquests in Africa and elsewhere. And when did
                    the Ethiopia conquest begin?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was just about to go, a little later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I think that accounted for a lot of the uniforms. If I habeen a year
                    later, I never would have gotten through Europe.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ASHER: I returned in June of 1931. I was met at the boat by my love from
                    Swarthmore, and we both enrolled at the University of Chicago that summer,
                    because I wanted to finish my undergraduate career. The depression put a
                    different stamp on playing around for x years of education. I had a wonderful
                    literature course from Thornton Wilder, who was teaching at Chicago that summer,
                    and a fine course from a political scientist from Wisconsin named John Gauss. He
                    was a very inspiring guy. I got a good introduction to the University of
                    Chicago. I found old classmates from University High School also at
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you bringing back as your intellectual luggage
                        froEurope?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was interested in art, literature and politics. Particularly in
                    politics. I got my master's degree in political science, not English literature,
                    although I continued to finish my major in English. After graduation, which was
                    in March of 1932 — this was really the depth of the depression — I wanted to
                    write. I went around with glowing letters from English teachers to newspapers,
                    to publishing houses, to bookstore owners. They, all of them, would say, “These
                    are nice credentials.” They would then pull out from a drawer a long yellow pad,
                    having two, three sheets already written and say, “These are the people we had
                    to let go in the last three years. With all due respect, I would take most of
                    them back before I would take you.” This left me in limbo and I kept saying, “If
                    I can't get experience, how do I get a job?” Couldn't get any job, there just
                    weren't any jobs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your family money? Your father's business at

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The depression cost him a lot but he was not sufferinfinancially.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, I wanted to get on with it. After graduation, I had a year of
                    wonderful experience, because I volunteered to work for the League for
                    Industrial Democracy (LID), thanks to my stepmother's knowledge of it. She was
                    on the board of the Chicago office of the LID. The biggest project they were
                    doing was organizing the unemployed to understand the relief system, to
                    demonstrate for a better system, particularly for help on rent, and relief
                    payments in cash. Relief didn't even cover food most of the time. There were
                    evictions, there were people put out on the street with their few possessions.
                    These horrors offered an eye-opening experience for someone who had had a pretty
                    privileged life up until then. To really see how the unemployed lived I got
                    deeply involved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your stepmother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ASHER: She was born in Argentina of German parents, was a university-trained
                    person, a socialist activist in 1918 demonstrating in Berlin for the end of the
                    war and for socialism. The family head, her father, was an inventor. He invented
                    a gold washing machine when, after six years or so in Argentina, they were in
                    South Africa for another half dozen years. But he came from a banking family.
                    They were wiped out by the inflation. My stepmother came to the U.S. as a
                    governess for the family of a friend of my father's, and then Dad got her, once
                    she was released by this friend. She entered the house as a governess, but a
                    well educated, literate person with socialist leanings. After a few years she
                    married my father, in 1929. I don't think we kids were particularly pleased with
                    the marriage, not wanting to share our father with anyone else.</p>

                    she did have intellectual interests and firm social ideas, and she thought the
                    LID would be a good experience for me. It was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: As a volunteer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The League for Industrial Democracy. It was headed by NormaThomas of New
                    York, a great American.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Mine was too. I got to know him and I took him around Chicago. He was
                    campaigning there. I voted for him, organized meetings for him, and so on. My
                    main interest in work being done by the League office in Chicago was organizing
                    something called the Chicago Workers' Committee on Unemployment, which had
                    so-called locals based in settlement houses, in churches, in some public schools
                    but not many, and we had in those days Mexican-speaking locals, Scandinavian
                    locals, Italian...</p>

                    world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Much of it around the stockyards, Jane Addams was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether in doing this Hull House came in
                        to youorbit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Hull House came very much in it. Its founder and guiding spirit, Jane
                    Addams, was one of my idols. She was a prominent pacifist, a Nobel Prize winner,
                    and a busy reformer. I first met her while I was still a student at the
                    University High School, when a group of us went to Hull House, to see one of
                    America's first and finest settlement houses, and to meet some of its leaders.
                    Five or six years later, when I became involved in organizing the unemployed,
                    Jane Addams was, I think, on the board of the MidwesterOffice of the LID. In any
                    event, Hull House became a hospitable meeting site for one or maybe two of the
                    so-called locals, the neighborhood units, of the Chicago Workers' Committee on
                    Unemployment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything. Literature, politics, social work,

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Chicago was an active political center, somewhat of cultural center, and a
                    crossroads of America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Architecture, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, Frank Lloyd Wright had built one of the houses in our neighborhood
                    and the architect/city planner, Daniel Burnham, left his imprint all over the
                    city. At the University of Chicago, in graduate school, I had an economics
                    course from Paul Douglas, an alderman who later became a Senator, and whose wife
                    became a Congresswoman. But at that time her chief claim to fame was not only
                    being the wife of a great economist, but also being the daughter of Lorado Taft,
                    the sculptor who had a fine piece of his sculpture on the Midway. Incidentally,
                    the residue of the Chicago World Fair of 1892 was still highly evident when I
                    was a kid.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. The initial financing for that museum was provided by Julius
                    Rosenwald, the Rosenwald I mentioned in connection with Sears Roebuck. It was
                    called the Rosenwald Museum for a while.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, and here I was, a youngster, running around with the girl I
                    eventually married, not the one who met me at the boat, but the one who was
                    deputy to the director of the Chicago LID office, a beautiful woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This came later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: When I volunteered, I went down to the office of the League for Industrial
                    Democracy and first met the saintly Quaker who lived in Chicago Commons — this
                    was a settlement house — and was in charge of the Midwestern office. He was very
                    eloquent and very moving in telling me what they were doing to give the
                    unemployed a voice. But I kept saying, “Yes, but if I volunteer, I want to do
                    something. What am I going to be doing?” On this, he was sort of airy and vague,
                    and he finally said, “Let me introduce you to my deputy. She's better informed
                    about our daily office activities.” He took me in to meet this gorgeous blond,
                    who knew exactly what she wanted me to do first. She said, “We need a speakers
                    bureau. We keep taking advantage of these few friends that we have, to send them
                    out to speak to these locals, and we don't have any real record. I want someone
                    to build up a file. That's my first need.”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I liked that kind of thing. I had been in academic life. I started a
                    five-by-eight card file with names of possible speakers, days of the week when
                    they might be called, when and where they last spoke, what the feedback was,
                    whether they were capable of addressing foreign-language localwe had two or
                    three Italian-speaking locals. Others spoke Spanish and we could send qualified
                    speakers to them. It was hard for us to find Polish speaking ones, but we did
                    find one or two. While I was organizing our speakers bureau, I kept saying, I
                    have to go to meetings to see these people. I don't want just to sit in the
                    office doing this. So I started going with people whose business it was to go to
                    these meetings, to find out what was going on. Most of the time I went with the
                    beautiful administrative assistant and I promptly fell for her. There weren't
                    any laws against it at the time, but I thought making passes at the boss was
                    probably not a good idea if I wanted to keep my unpaid job. So I concealed my
                    affection quite a while till it was obvious that it was mutual. Then I kept
                    saying I can't get married until I find a paid job. We could sleep together, we
                    could travel together, but I felt I couldn't make a lifetime commitment without
                    a regular source of income.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Ethel Watson, not Jewish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: She was Midwestern. Her father came over to this country from Scotland. He
                    was a golf pro. Her mother was also Scottish. Ethel was born in this country ten
                    months after they were married, like me. Ethel was an only child. Went to school
                    mostly in Kansas City. Her father started as a golf pro, at the Skokie Country
                    Club on the outskirts of Chicago, but then went into designing golf courses.
                    From that, I think through one of the Jewish country clubs for which he designed
                    a course somewhere near Kansas City, he got a chance to buy a couple of early
                    movie houses and he became the owner of three motion picture houses as well as
                    president of the Missouri Motion Picture Exhibitors Association. And Ethel went
                    to the University of Kansas, majored in sociology, and was active in progressive
                    causes there. She married the darling of the sociology department, was married
                    for five years, and was separated at the time we met. Subsequently divorced, so
                    she was a little older than I was.</p>

                    Unemployment, called “The Jobless Help Themselves.” To my amazement, it was
                    accepted by The New Republic. It was the lead article.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Yes. And Robert Morss Lovett, who was an English professor at the
                    University of Chicago and active in the League for Industrial Democracy, knew
                    me. Whether he wrote a note to Bruce Bliven or not, I don't know. Anyhow, I sent
                    it sort of blind anI was delighted to have it accepted. I got a copy, with a big
                    caption on the cover, “The Jobless Help Themselves: A Lesson from Chicago,” by
                    Robert E. Asher. Moreover, I got paid $32.50 for it. I thought, “Gee, this is
                    wonderful, I can write.” I wrote for a new, short-lived magazine called “All
                    Chicago,” and they paid $10. I sold some pieces on particular aspects of the
                    unemployment and relief situation. So I really got deeply into organizing and
                    writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, to put it in the context, this is really...
                        welfare today is institutionalized, social security, everything else. But
                        this was all being created on the ground, and individual cases.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. I wrote prodigiously but I earned less than $500, quite a bit less.
                    So I decided I'd better go back to school and get a Master's or Ph. D degree in
                    political science. I was interested in it. The New Deal was just beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be '33.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, and I went back and got a master's degree in political science,
                    really public administration. Which I was told was the easiest degree for me to
                    get. I found a lousy part time job with the American Public Welfare Association.
                    Not a lousy job, but a lousy employment arrangement under which I was paid $25 a
                    week when I was actually employed and that wasn't very much of the time. A week
                    a month maybe. One day in 1934 my boss, Frank Bain, put his hand over the phone,
                    and said, “How would you like to go to Washington for six weeks?” I said, “Now?
                    It's out of the question.” He said, “I've got somebody, Harry.”</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>It was Harry Hopkins calling him for a young fellow who might do a study of how
                    those states that had any money allocated their relief funds to counties and
                    municipalities, to see whether there was anything the federal government could
                    learn from that about allocating its relief funds to states. After he hung up
                    the phone and promised Harry Hopkins that he had somebody, he said to me — this
                    was on Thursday — “You don't really have to go on Friday. I think you can wait
                    until Monday.” I said, “I've got a job here, I've got a girl, I've got my
                    interest in writing” and so on. He said, “Look, it's for six weeks. Go. If you
                    don't like it, you can come back. There is a little work here and there will be
                    other work, and so on. I advise you to go.” I took his advice. I left on Monday
                    and I started the six weeks job with the federal government that lasted for 20
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll stop at this point. One question, in 1934 when you
                        went to Washington. One question I will put to you though. How did you and
                        your circles view the advent of Roosevelt and was it really called the New
                        Deal then? We'll talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 21st of November, 2000. Bob, you wanted to adsomething?</p>
                <p>ASHER: I told you about the year I had in Europe after my junior year in college.
                    For me, it was liberating, it was eye-opening, it was exciting, it was my chance
                    to learn about art and theater, and do all sorts of things that one didn't do in
                    Hanover, New Hampshire, at Dartmouth College. Since our conversation, I started
                    Arthur M. Schlesinger'A Life in the 20th Century. In fact, I got deep into
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Schlesinger Junior.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A distinguished historian. His father was also a
                        distinguishehistorian.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ASHER: He pays a nice tribute to him in this book. Very well done. He talks about
                    his father's original contributions to the understanding of American history.
                    Arthur Jr. was a very precocious youngster and he made a trip around the world
                    with his parents and his brother in 1933/34. He was younger when he made the
                    trip than I was in 1930-31, but the trip was a couple of years later than the
                    one I made. His summing up of his feeling about his year abroad is exactly mine.
                    He says, “For a na�ve and impressionable boy, the trip around the world was the
                    best possible education. It widened horizons, stimulated curiosity, strengthened
                    self reliance and along the way, provided an introduction to the political
                    disquiets of the 20th century.” That's just the way I feel about the year that I
                    had, when I was attending at least for one semester the University of Berlin and
                    traveling the rest of the time in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Question I left hanging there, before you went to
                        Washington,sort of within your circle, how was New Deal viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: To start with the most cynical part, it was the greatest employment agency
                    that had come along since the beginning of the depression. Roosevelt, as you
                    know was elected overwhelmingly in the 1932 election. His was a new voice,
                    hopeful and willing to experiment. Of special interest to those of us at the
                    University of Chicago, he had already co-opted a number of the faculty members
                    to New Deal agencies in Washington to help plan programs and then work there. I
                    think all of us had the notion that we were more likely to get a job somewhere
                    in the new expanding federal government than we would be teaching or researching
                    or in private industry, which as I had discovered, was hiring nobody. I think I
                    told you I had applied for a job with the Tennessee Valley Authority, but before
                    that came through I had this chance to come to Washington for six weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other question I'd like to ask. Can you tell about
                        your dealings with and view, while you were working in Chicago after
                        college, of the communist party, its goals, ties to the intellectual
                        community that you were familiar with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ASHER: I encountered some of the leading communists, although they usually didn't
                    admit their affiliation, in the work of organizing the unemployed of Chicago in
                    the Chicago Workers' Committee on Unemployment. The communists also had a
                    parallel effort to organize under their banner Unemployed Councils, which on the
                    whole were much more militant than we were. We wanted peaceful demonstrations.
                    The communists actually wanted martyrs, people who would be physically carried
                    off by the police, while waving banners of “Free Tom Mooney”, “Free the
                    Scottsboro boys and Tom Mooney,” or in some other way providing copy for The
                    Daily Worker (the Communist newspaper) and hopefully the metropolitan press.
                    Most of the unemployed weren't the least bit interested. I shouldn't say
                    “weren't the least bit interested.” They were stirred by the oratory, so there
                    was a constant appeal from the communist group for joint efforts, for a united
                    front with the Chicago Workers' Committee with which I was involved, whose
                    newspaper I launched, and whose activities I was very close to. We did go, I
                    think it was in October 1932, for a united front demonstration with the
                    Unemployed Councils. We got the permits, that's no easy job in Chicago, or
                    wasn't in those days, to parade downtown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had rather, it was still very much the ball system,
                        but iwasn't the Bathhouse, what ever his name was, but it was still...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I am not sure that it would not have been equally hard in another city.
                    The unemployed individually were no threat to anybody, but collectively they
                    seemed pretty ominous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had the break-up of the unemployed service-men by
                        DouglaMacArthur and company in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. And the longshoremen were striking in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bridges' boys.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. And they were communists. We got our permit on a promise that it
                    would be a peaceful parade through the loop, it would go to Grant Park and we
                    could make speeches there. First there was a lot of argument with the communists
                    about who would be the speakers. Of course we obviously didn't want to hand it
                    to them, and they in turn were very eager to make the most out of this
                    propaganda opportunity. There were one or two instances during the parade in
                    which members of the Unemployed Councils got out of line, trying to climb a lamp
                    post or do something that scared the hell out of the police. I learned from this
                    and subsequent efforts that the communists were working for the Soviet Union and
                    not for the U.S. All of their positions were based on Soviet Union directives. I
                    became sensitive to recognizing the line when I heard it, whether the person
                    admitted it or not, and feeling fairly incensed by their lack of genuine concern
                    for the workers that they were supposedly rallying in Chicago and elsewhere.
                    Also with the distortions in their publications of what was actually going on. I
                    got sensitized long before World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went to government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. I wound up as anti-communist but pro-New Deal. hadn't been converted
                    easily from my socialist leanings to the New Deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One further question on this. Chicago was sort of known as
                        the second city, particularly in intellectual thought and all that, next to
                        New York, Chicago was a center of literature, art and all this. Were you at
                        all plugged in, aware of were, what the French would call “intellectual
                        class” was going with the subject of communism, was it mixed or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I think it was mixed. My intellectual friends were largely liberal or
                    socialist. My father had many friends among the writers but most of them were
                    out of town, Ludwig Lewisohn, Edna Millay, and other writers. I knew the
                    pacifist group in Chicago and they were very prominent. The Christian Century
                    was one of their leading publications and I wrote a number of pieces for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Goldstar, others like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I don't remember coming into contact with them at all. The University had
                    a communist corps within the student body. I honestly don't know much about the
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't that apparent, that there was a strong faculty
                        core.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ASHER: No, not like Harvard, where they had debates. In graduate school I learned
                    about those. There were several socialists on the faculty. There was a
                    red-baiting benefactor, Charles Walgreen, who promoted a hearing on seditious
                    thinking at the University of Chicago, but he didn't really get anywhere. By
                    that time Robert Maynard Hutchins was in charge and really made vigorous
                    defenses of the University. I don't think he had to exaggerate to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are coming to 1934. You are off to the big city of
                        Washington. When you arrived there, how you saw Washington and life in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I arrived in my second hand Chevrolet, which I sold a little while after
                    getting here for what was supposed to be a six weeks job at the Federal
                    Emergency Relief Administration. It had been in business for some months but was
                    still a relatively small organization. Washington was pretty chaotic. Roosevelt
                    knew that for the kinds of programs he was interested in, and wanted the country
                    to benefit from, he probably had to establish emergency agencies outside of the
                    regular civil service framework. Of course the old-line bureaucrats were unhappy
                    about this arrangement and jealous of the higher salaries, in some cases, and
                    the exemption from civil service procedures. I got buried very quickly in the
                    Federal Emergency Relief Administration, because I thought I had six weeks only
                    and I'd better get busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you stay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I got a room for six dollars a week, or something like that, at 2120 G
                    Street, within walking distance of the Walker Johnson building on 17th and New
                    York Ave., where I was working. It was an awful room in an awful place, but I
                    was only in it from 11:00 PM till 6:30 AM or so, and I was sure I was on a
                    short-term assignment. The assignment was within something called the Municipal
                    Finance Section of the newly established Federal Emergency Relief
                    Administration. The job was to do a report on those states that had any relief
                    money to distribute to counties and municipalities, see what criteria they used
                    — numbers eligible for relief, urban/rural distributions, wage levels, anything
                    that seemed relevant — and see whether there were any guidelines that would be
                    useful to the federal government, in distributing funds to the states. It turned
                    out, and didn't take much research to discover, that there were only about a
                    half a dozen states that had any relief funds to be distributed. I got in touch
                    with those people and worked very hard to produce my report. As I worked on it,
                    I began to have visions of it becoming an important guideline but that was not
                    what it turned into. It went, through channels, to Corrington Gill, who was
                    director of Research, Finance and Statistics.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>From what he later told me, he took it to Mr. Hopkins, who said, “What's this?”
                    Gill said, “You wanted a young fellow to do a study on how those states that had
                    any relief funds distribute them to counties and municipalities. This young
                    fellow has done a study which you might be interested in. I think you ought to
                    read it.” And Hopkins said, “Thank him very much and tell him all the money has
                    been distributed.” Every governor was on his doorstep, every senator and every
                    congressman was badgering him. He made the political decision that it was better
                    to get the state people out of Washington, back to where they belonged and to
                    get the program started with a pledge of some kind of money, and as he
                    apparently said to Gill, “What's the difference iPennsylvania gets a million
                    dollars too much and Ohio too little on the first allocation? Neither is going
                    to cure the unemployment problem. We can always make it up later.” In due
                    course, I got from Mr. Gill, “Here is your report. Mr. Hopkins thanks you very
                    much for it but says there is no money right now to distribute.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I'll go back to Chicago, this was a good experience”, and so
                    forth. He said, “You can't do that.” I said, “Why can't I? That's the only thing
                    I can do! I've got half of a job in Chicago and I don't have anything here.” He
                    said, “It's no secret that we are going to move into a work program and we don't
                    know the occupational characteristics of the people who are unemployed, we don't
                    know what kinds of projects would make the best use of those characteristics, we
                    don't know what kind of wages we ought to pay that would take people off relief
                    but not discourage them from going into private employment. There is just a
                    tremendous amount that a young fellow like you could do to help us!” I said, “If
                    this is the use they make of it, I can do my research in Chicago.” He said,
                    “It's a real challenge here, we really want some people to get busy on these
                    programs. We are now paying you at a rate of $1,700 per year, minus 15%”, which
                    was the economy deduction. He said, “If we can get you $2,000, would you stay?”
                    And I sold out.</p>

                    young. Anyhow, I called up my beloved Ethel and she said, “Sure, I'll come right

                    agency that was buying up the cattle that were killed under some agriculture

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I guess. We had a child born in 1936, so Ethel quit work after some
                    months. As I have indicated, it was a very exciting period, the early work
                    relief planning. I got involved almost accidentally in the planning for the
                    Federal Art, Music, Theater and Writers Program of the Works Progress
                    Administration, as it was called at first. The first large appropriation for the
                    WPA had in it 27 million dollars set aside for federal projectswithout any
                    knowledge at first of what they really wanted to consider a federal project. The
                    rest was to be allocated to the states.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>A woman named Hallie Flanagan, who taught at Vassar and knew Harry Hopkins and
                    Franklin Roosevelt, wrote them and said there should be a theater project. There
                    were unemployed actors, scene-shifters, pit musicians, all sorts of people. And
                    plays could be put on in schools and in community centers. New drama could be
                    tried out. She held out all sorts of possibilities that appealed to Hopkins and
                    to the President. And particularly to Mrs. Roosevelt, who was very active in the
                    fields of education and the arts. The new director at the Museum of Modern Art,
                    Holger E. Cahill, known as Eddie Cahill to all his friends, reported that there
                    were large numbers of unemployed artists. We had an occupational census that we
                    had taken that did indeed show that, at least in the larger cities, there were
                    aggregations of unemployed writers, musicians, artists, theater workers, etc.
                    and that it would be wonderful to have some kind of employment project for them.
                    It would make use of those people's training. But it was a totally new kind of
                    activity for the federal government. There were few precedents.</p>
                <p>I went over, for instance, to the procurement division of the Treasury to report
                    that artists needed oil paints in tubes, and some would probably have to be
                    imported, and I was told by this very friendly but critical Treasury bureaucrat,
                    “Sonny, the federal government already buys 50 different kinds of paints. We buy
                    maroon, black and white paint for barns, for railroad ties, for public
                    buildings. We buy it in 10-gallon cans and not in tubes like you want. Honestly,
                    it would be easier to give you a few cans than to go through the difficulties of
                    ordering.” I said, “Well, that isn't the way artists work. I can't pour it into
                    tubes and get an equivalent amount of oil-based paint.” It took a good three or
                    four days of work over there to try to convince them that that sort of thing was
                    reasonable, given the appropriation for a work program and the implicit promise
                    to put people at work on projects consistent with their previous training and
                    activity. Similarly, for the theater project, we explained that somehow there
                    had to be a little cash available for the time that the leading lady is sick and
                    somebody twice or half her size has to take her place. You have to rush out and
                    get a costume for them, or for curtain tears that you have to do something about
                    it. There are just a lot of emergency requirements. They said, “There is no
                    program that allows a federal employee to carry federal cash around in his
                    pocket.” We had to develop a complicated procedure under which there was an
                    agent cashier for those theater projects that were likely to have unexpected
                    financial needs. That guy had to be bonded and he had to account for this money.
                    The proceeds, if any, from the plays did not have to go into the miscellaneous
                    receipts of the Treasury, which was what the Treasury regulations required, but
                    would be available for emergency purchases.</p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ASHER: It was coming to me because we had a little unit in the federal project
                    which was called Procedures, Finance and Statistics. We were initially housed in
                    a fine old building, Evelyn Walsh McLean's mansion at 1500 I Street. She also
                    owned half of upper Wisconsin Avenue, and she was glad to rent her downtown
                    residence to the federal government. Working there one Saturday morning we
                    discovered a case of champagne in the basement that helped our weekend
                    memorably. We did work weekends most of the time. In fact, the regular work week
                    was five and a half days. It was not unusual to find people on duty on Saturday
                    afternoons and on Sundays. There was no overtime pay and practically no
                    compensatory time off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Five and a half days was the norm everywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, throughout the federal government. Our unit was supposedly trying to
                    anticipate and collaborate on administrative problems. We were in the same
                    building as the directors of these projects and their deputies and
                    administrative staff, so we could consult daily on the problems. Their aim was
                    to get their programs going and to hell with all these procedures, let's get
                    these people paid, let's put on some nice plays and concerts. The writers
                    project had one wonderful project, which was the preparation of American guides
                    for each state in the union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the River Series, too. I made a project of
                        readinevery book in the River Series.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Did you? That's wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rivers of America it was called.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>ASHER: They anticipated some of these problems, but not all of them. Because they
                    thought it was the most natural thing in the world that the musicians, for
                    example, should get paid not only for performing if they were a symphony
                    orchestra, but also for rehearsing. But as far as the federal government was
                    concerned, when I indicated that the musicians were to be paid for rehearsing, I
                    was told, “What the hell, they're supposed to be professional musicians, what do
                    they need rehearsals for?” “Well, symphony orchestras do not come into being for
                    public performance right away, and you have to pay them for rehearsing.” “Well,
                    how much rehearsing are they going to do in proportion to when they play?” “That
                    will depend on the director and when he thinks the orchestra is ready. Of course
                    the individual performers in the parks, puppet shows and so on, don't require
                    much training but some of the orchestras are going to be rehearsing quite a
                    while.” That was a big battle. There were any number of new problems.And we were
                    trying to keep track of who was actually on the program and whether those people
                    were getting paid. These artists and musicians were not very good at reporting
                    to Washington what the payroll was, and they would say, “My people haven't been
                    paid in six weeks.” And we'd say, “Where is the list?” And they'd say, “Ooh, we
                    never sent that in. We meant to.” They'd backdate it. That's pretty risky
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the lady from Vassar. What was her name

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Hallie Flanagan. She was a drama professor, she knew how to employ theater
                    personnel. She came to Washington as the first director of the Federal Theater
                    Program.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Only the backlash of it. Also there was the play “The Black Mikado”
                    employing a black cast of actors and actresses, which raised many eyebrows.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Anyhow, the theater project, especially in New York put on some very
                    avant-garde material, which was swell, but the lesson I learned was that, if you
                    are working with public funds, you'd better stay within some sort of boundaries
                    of tolerance of educated people, because those who are greatly offended can hurt
                    your projects.</p>

                </p>
                <p> ASHER: Exactly. As I say, it made me wonder, but I didn't get a chance to do any
                    research, although I marked it down as something to study. If you go back to
                    Europe, find out how the Stadttheaters and publicly supported art activities get
                    the freedom they seem to have to produce what they want. We certainly cannot get
                    it under our present system of government.</p>

                        left in a hurry, but for the researchers, they might want to look at a movie
                        that came out about two years ago, called “The Cradle Will Rock”. It talks
                        about Hallie Flanagan, and the whole performance about her fight with
                        Congress, she is an ancient figure there, and then it has performance of the
                        Cradle Will Rock, which is very left-wingish, good music</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That was really fun, and popular. But if you are asking me whether I got
                    esthetically involved, the answer is no. The burden of defending them publicly
                    was on the directors of those programs, on the Assistant Administrator for
                    Professional and Service Projects, and on Harry Hopkins.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: We were not playing any role officially. We were sensitive to it, because
                    we were involved in preparing some of the Congressional testimony, but we were
                    not substantively involved in program planning or execution. Our job was to make
                    it feasible for the directors to run the programs, namely, to get them financed,
                    not to get their directors jailed for accounting irregularities, to get them the
                    supplies they needed in some way, so that they could function. But in the
                    process, I did get to know those directors and their deputies and their lower
                    level staff, some of the state people, and some of the names that were involved

                    wasn't very difficult. The states all had so much public work that had fallen
                    behind, roads that needed repairing, water and sewer maintenance, buildings to
                    be refurbished, classrooms, everything. They really had a wealth of perfectly
                    eligible work projects they submitted through the state and got approved. Not
                    that there weren't problems. There were. There were particular problems
                    regarding the employment of women. We had an assistant administrator, I think
                    she was originally called Assistant Administrator for Women's Projects, but she
                    eventually became Assistant Administrator for Professional and Service Projects
                    with responsibility for the projects in which eventually I got involved, to take
                    care of craft workers in isolated mountain regions of Tennessee and Kentucky,
                    mattress making, library work. Yes, I got involved in those, but not in
                    construction. We had an excellent Corps of Engineers director for construction
                    projects, Colonel Harrington, who ran a tight ship and eventually succeeded
                    Hopkins, after the first reorganization act. Hopkins went to Commerce, as
                    Secretary of Commerce. I was involved in non-construction projects.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, it was separate. It was under the Army and it employed only young
                    males, aged 16-25. The National Youth Administration, a unit within the WPA,
                    with which I had become quite familiar, employed women, young girls and well as
                    young men. Not to take them out into the wilderness but to enable them to stay
                    in high school and stay in college, through earning a few dollars a week. If I
                    can get ahead of myself just a little bit, when under the First Reorganization
                    Act of 1939 the National Youth Administration was separated from the WPA and put
                    it into the new Federal Security Agency, Aubrey Williams, previously WPA Deputy
                    Administrator, was made the director of the National Youth Administration. He
                    took me along, with a number of other WPA people, and made me head of Procedures
                    within the National Youth Administration. It wasn't really a new agency because
                    it had been created and functioning within the WPA structure.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>ASHER: He brought to the government — and he wasn't the only one — a sense of
                    urgency that wasn't there under the old civil service, as far as I know. He was
                    brilliant, incisive, but I guess I can say, his arrogance made enemies. He had
                    no sympathy with the unintelligent or the uninformed Congressmen and he kind of
                    showed this and it cost him a lot. He was contemptuous of organizational lines.
                    If he liked somebody here, he would call him up... It turned out to be
                    tremendous boon for me. I might never have met Aubrey Williams, had I not been
                    in the office one Saturday afternoon, when he called up and needed some
                    statistics. He was going to make a speech the following day and I said, “I don't
                    think there is anyone here to give you that.” He said, “You are there. Come
                    over.” So I came over with some relevant information and met him, and that's how
                    I got to know him.</p>
                <p>I did not have any direct meetings with Hopkins, except when he addressed the
                    staff as a whole. In testimony before Congress, his philosophy was to answer all
                    questions off the cuff immediately and wind up his appearance, rather than to
                    say, “I'll provide you with that information when I get back to my office.” When
                    the transcript arrived at his office, we flunkies made extensive modifications
                    to make an honest, forthcoming reasonably diplomatic witness out of our boss. If
                    more than editorial changes in his remarks were needed, we would insert a
                    paragraph in smaller type as a kind of footnote to what had been said. Hopkins
                    burnt himself out terrifically, a constant chain-smoker, he was thin as a rail,
                    but eager to be on top of the organization. He didn't want a lawyer, he was
                    prejudiced, he and Aubrey Williams were both prejudiced, against lawyers. But in
                    those programs, you could argue that some legal talent was needed.</p>
                <p>When I went to the National Youth Administration, Aubrey said, “You are going to
                    be my lawyer.” I said, “Aubrey, I have a political science degree, I am not a
                    lawyer.” He said, “Well, then you can deal with the lawyers in the Federal
                    Security Administration, but I am not going to have any lawyer here on the NYA
                    pay roll.” And Hopkins had a little of that. When Hopkins finally did get
                    lawyers, I think probably on a recommendation from the CIO, he got Lee Pressman
                    and John Abt who were both in my opinion communists. That probably only
                    reinforced his notion of why he didn't like lawyers, and it was a troublesome
                    foible.</p>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>ASHER: Well, yes. I knew we had some because I could spot them on the basis of my
                    experience as a socialist in Chicago who had had to keep an eye on the
                    communist-led Unemployed Councils. A few communists worked secretly within the
                    WPA union. The WPA projects, particularly in New York, obviously had some
                    communists on their rolls. I don't think it was much of a problem elsewhere.
                    Maybe in Los Angeles and Hollywood there were communists. The technical attitude
                    had to be, as long as they are doing their job, and putting in the right number
                    of hours, and producing what they are supposed to be producing, fine. Then you
                    got into the arguments in the art program, for example, about what should
                    somebody be painting? And Diego Rivera, who painted in the Rockefeller Center,
                    wasn't on a WPA pay roll as far as I can recall.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: And there were few idiocies like that on our programs too. But I would say
                    the main centers of controversy were far and away New York City and next
                    probably California. Those unfortunately were the areas of concentration for
                    unemployed artists, musicians and writers. They eventually made the program
                    vulnerable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with the civil service bureaucracy? Did

                        guerilla movement, up to the '39 period, let's say.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ASHER: Up to '39, yes, there was a kind of guerilla warfare. There were New
                    Dealers in these emergency agencies who were zealots, or thought to be, eager to
                    get their programs going, eager to make a mark, eager to make a dent on the
                    problems that they were created to deal with. And a bureaucracy, the Treasury
                    and Comptroller-General particularly, had the job of guarding the resources of
                    the U.S., seeing that they were well spent and accounted for, within the
                    appropriations, and disbursed at a rate that would carry them through the fiscal
                    year. And this made for a constant battle. A further problem on our work program
                    was with Harold Ickes, who was head to the Department of Interior. “Honest
                    Harold” was a cautious New Dealer who couldn't see construction projects under
                    the less cautious administration of someone like Hopkins, when the real
                    construction program was Bonneville Dam and Grand Coulee and so on. I went to
                    several meetings in the very early days before I got involved in professional
                    projects, arguing that there were two different roles. And I wasn't alone, there
                    was a team of us. We tried to make it plain that the kinds of projects that
                    Ickes was administering under thPublic Works Program were great for the country,
                    like those of the Tennessee Valley Authority, but they took a long time
                    planning, they had to do these surveys and tests which, as you know, were a
                    multi-year thing. And we had unemployed people who had to be put to work the
                    next week to eat. The kinds of projects that we were talking about were not
                    major public works, but repairing existing roads and filling potholes, improving
                    the parks, and so on. I think it was always a little guerilla warfare there. I
                    don't think Ickes really believeHopkins was a dangerous kind of administrator
                    and Hopkins thought the PWA was a fine program, let them alone, let them do
                    their work, but don't let them get in our way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Public Works Administration. There are now some environmental problems
                    resulting from those projects, but I don't think that they could have been
                    foreseen at the time. Ickes was scrupulously honest.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Yes. Well, I don't want to go into detail. Through his second wife, Jane,

                <p>ASHER: I met him very early. He was an impressive dreamer, if I can describe
                    someone that way. He was very well informed on agricultural problems, hybrid
                    corn and things like that which he introduced to Mexico as well as spreading
                    widely in the U.S. He was a pretty wealthy agriculturalist. His department was
                    responsible for a lot of new programs in agriculture. I don't remember their
                    names but with some of them we had very close relationships because we had rural
                    unemployed who needed work and some of those agricultural programs employed
                    large numbers of people. Wherever there was an agency that could take
                    responsibility for a certain project, WPA shared or allocated it to them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The national parks were employers of temporary labor. But there seemed to
                    be at least two separate communities in Washington at the time: the New Dealers
                    from various agencies who congregated in evenings in Georgetown parlors and
                    elsewhere, and the old line employees who were ringing their hands and saying,
                    “How can we ever run a respectable government with crazy people like these
                    around?” Some of the New Deal agencies made a real effort to employ people from
                    established agencies. The good republican director of procedures for the WPA had
                    come from one of the old-line agencies and was brought to the NYA as Director of
                    Finance and Statistics. He was excellent, we needed a policeman like that within
                    the WPA. He would say “No” to everything and then had to be persuaded that it
                    was alright. I learned an awful lot from him, because in NYA. I had to clear my
                    procedures with him and the other division directors to get them issued. It's
                    very important, I think, in an agency to build in some in-house critics who will
                    see things differently and point out what otherwise could become a terrible blow
                    in the face.</p>

                        bureaucracy, the civil servants would generally be sort of southern city
                        folk, pretty conservative. I think J. Edgar Hoover is a good example of
                        this. Then. All of a sudden, you city slickers, a great influx of bright
                        young Jewish boys coming in and all this. These are not two cultures that
                        mix very well.</hi>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ASHER: That's right. It was compounded, I think, by the fact that the White House
                    itself was interested in the New Deal agencies and perhaps less open, less
                    accessible to these old-line bureaucrats who had to undertake basic activities
                    of the government. They tracked down gangsters, collected the taxes, etc.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. He made Cordell Hull Secretary of State but then dealt with Sumner
                    Welles, the Undersecretary. Incidentally, though, on the other side of the
                    picture, was the knowledge that the White House favored and was behind programs
                    like the WPA art projects. This fact, if used judiciously, could puncture
                    arguments with some of the older, recalcitrant agencies. I could just say, but I
                    didn't want to do it often, “Well, I am afraid that if it gets to the White
                    House that we can't get the paints to the painters, there is going to be an
                    unpleasant reaction.” Then they would say, “Let me find a way to do it.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Mrs. Roosevelt was a major player. She was a close friend not only of
                    Hopkins, from New York days, but of the director of women's projects in WPA.
                    Very early in my career I accompanied the woman who was the assistant
                    administrator for women's projects over to the White House to see Mrs. Roosevelt
                    and tell her something about the work we were doing. She was particularly
                    interested in the Resettlement Administration, which had a project in
                    Arthurdale, West Virginia, that produced some craft-ware, and in getting the WPA
                    to do something of that kind in Kentucky and Tennessee and North Carolina...</p>

                <p>ASHER: Yes, it was a prize example of poverty. But its people also had talents.
                    They made their own brooms and they were attractive. They turned out pottery,
                    ashtrays, fireplace tongs, napkins rings, bird houses, and what not. When we
                    reported to Mrs. Roosevelt that these things were being produced, she got
                    interested. I went to one meeting at the White House, I don't know what year it
                    was, with Mrs. Woodward, the Assistant Administrator for Professional and
                    Service Projects, and her assistant, Anne Cronin. Mrs. Roosevelt had also
                    invited the buyers of the proper departments in Macy's, Bloomingdale's and two
                    or three other such places, to see whether they could market our stuff. The
                    meeting reached its anti-climax pretty quickly, when Macy's man said, “Well, how
                    many of these”, whatever it was, napkin rings or something, “do you produce in a
                    month?” We gave some figure and he said, “Well, our little department does
                    $2,500 a day worth of business, and we can't run out of things.” We couldn't
                    promise to produce hand-made ashtrays and knitted scarves, brooms, fireplace
                    tongs, at a rate that could satisfy Bloomingdale's and Macy's, so we had to go
                    back to marketing mostly by giveaway for use in public buildings, and so on.
                    There was a little bit of genuine marketing in specialty shops. But the answer
                    to your question is that Mrs. Roosevelt was interested in the WPA's
                    non-construction projects and she was deeply interested in the National Youth
                    Administration. She played hostess to our state NYA administrators for a meeting
                    at her cottage at Hyde Park, right after it was built. She knew a lot about the
                    NYA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was concern later... I harp on the communist thing,
                        but this was a concern throughout this whole period. The Youth
                        Administration was concerned by some, if I recall correctly, as sort of a
                        hot bad if not communist, left-wing activity. Maybe I am wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I think the WPA arts projects were much more so. In the youth program, we
                    had good clean state administrators. Lyndon Johnson was administrator in Texas;
                    Tom Popejoy, later President of the University of New Mexico; Boisfeuillet Jones
                    in Georgia, who later had a distinguished career in health and welfare and whose
                    son, Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr., became publisher and chief executive of the
                    Washington Post. Excellent people. If there was any communist problem, it was in
                    universities where NYA employees were employed as research assistants to
                    professors, some of whom may have been very far left. With one exception, I
                    don't recall that there was any furor about the NYA Washington Office. The NYA
                    ended by running out of youth.</p>

                        about the social life? Obviously, you were all working long hours and all,
                        but, you're young...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>ASHER: We were young and willing to stay up late, though I was less willing than
                    some. It was a wonderful chance, there were a great number of bright young
                    lawyers brought into the soirees, not from our agency but from other agencies.
                    They were articulate at these evening meetings, so that even if you were working
                    on relief projects, you got some taste of the problems facing the Securities
                    Exchange Commission or the Justice Dept. There were many people who liked being
                    host to the New Dealers and then there would be a suggestion, “If we are going
                    to talk more about that the next time, we ought to bring in so-and-so.”</p>
                <p>My wife and I were very much involved in one group hosted by Felix Cohen, son of
                    Morris R. Cohen, a very distinguished philosopher. Felix was a lawyer at
                    Interior and a socialist. He collected a number of his friends from New York and
                    included a few of us from Chicago, Wisconsin, and elsewhere. Lively discussions.
                    Usually somebody would pose a problem or indicate what he was doing and other
                    people would chime in with their thoughts about it, trying to keep each other
                    sort of briefed. But it was very social, it was a chance to relax. A lot of it
                    doesn't sound like people today, who turn on the TV and sit on a sofa. Our
                    chairs were uncomfortable, by the way, and the room was usually a little more
                    crowded than it should be. Cigarette ashes were dropping around. But it was an
                    exciting exposure. Sometimes about a new book that was out, published some other
                    place. Sometimes it was to be hospitable to someone from out of town who was
                    temporarily in Washington on consultation or just looking around. Or looking for
                    a job, and some of us might be helpful. Each participant would have a different
                    relationship to the others, but it was a get-together one evening a week, to
                    keep track of where we were going and basically whether we were getting anywhere
                    on getting out of the depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the questions. Sometimes it's been said
                        that all the stuff that Roosevelt did, it really took the war to do it. But
                        people weren't starving, something was happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: A lot was happening. People were eating again and the President with his
                    buoyant spirits had lifted the country's spirits. Cheered it overwhelmingly, as
                    the 1936 election showed. But there were vestiges of depression that lingered on
                    and on, and seemed very difficult to overcome. Areas where there just wasn't any
                    private employment, so that in a way I have a lot of sympathy for the statement
                    that building up the military defenses and forces of the country did a great
                    deal to reduce unemployment and make the WPA, the NYA and the Resettlement
                    Administration obsolete. Redundant, I guess, is the word.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Its rearmament program was one way of beating unemployment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was watching it personally because I had relatives in Germany and lots
                    of activity about trying to get them out. And I had been a student in Germany.
                    And I was not alone. There were a number of refugees employed by the New Deal,
                    who were connected with the universities, and who'd gotten hired by the New
                    Deal. I think a large number of the New Dealers were concerned about
                    developments in Germany and Italy. But I don't know how the State Department was
                    reacting to it, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their role was not great, because they were bureaucrats,
                        and because of the immigration law, essentially, and because if the
                        unemployment in the U.S., was not very responsive to the plight,
                        particularly the Jews, but of others. It didn't respond well. There were
                        some individual cases of councilor office saying, “To hell with this, I am
                        going to give visas”, and essentially bypassing the law, but it didn't
                        respond very well. But it represented the will of Congress at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I think the New Deal group was much more in favor of loosening the bars,
                    and working on ways of doing it. But the President was very wary. He sensed the
                    isolationist sentiment and understood it, and knew that he had to work very
                    gradually to get the U.S. to recognize that England was either going to be or
                    was already standing alone, and that we had to get busy through our war
                    agencies. I went to one from the National Youth Administration, and had a
                    wonderful opportunity there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I went into the NYA in 1939, when it was established as a separate unit,
                    and remained until late in 1941, right after war was declared. I went in early
                    1942 into the War Production Board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Youth Administration. Was this just
                        continuation of what you were doing or did you have a different focus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ASHER: Well, I had a more exalted position, and it was an interesting job. When
                    Aubrey Williams took me there he said, “You are going to be my lawyer, you are
                    going to be in charge of procedures” — procedures then being understood as rules
                    and regulations for the states — “but I want you to know I am not going to judge
                    you by the number of procedures or volumes that you get out, but how little. I
                    want the state administrators to have the freedom to experiment and to do
                    one-of-a-kind things. I don't want them to go to jail, but don't bring me a lot
                    of stuff regulating the details of our operations.” I thought that was
                    wonderful, to be judged not by what you produce but what you don't produce.
                    That's a very strong position to be in. But one of the first things I had to
                    take in for Mr. Williams' approval were the accounting regulations, and they
                    weren't thin. I brought them in and said, “These are for your signature.” He
                    said, “What's this?” I said, “It's the accounting regulations.” He said, “Does
                    it give any more pay for the boys and girls?” I said, “No, it just makes sure
                    that they do get paid honestly and that the money can be accounted for.” “Well,
                    why are they so big?” I said, “ When money is involved, there are a lot of
                    federal regulations.” He said, “I am only interested in procedures that do
                    something directly for the kids on the program.” I said, “I am, too, but there
                    are certain laws we have to observe and one of the first is to get the
                    accounting straight, before we get into trouble.” So he reluctantly signed
                    them.</p>
                <p>We were an early example of the employment of blacks in professional capacities.
                    Aubrey Williams, himself a southerner, appointed as Negro Affairs Adviser to the
                    National Youth Administration, Mary McCloud Bethune. Mrs. Bethune, the daughter
                    of former slaves, was a black leader and founder of Bethune-Cookman College. She
                    brought in a very able assistant, Ralph Lanier, I think his name was, though I
                    am not sure. He later became a president of a black college in Virginia. They
                    had a difficult role. They were not in the direct line of operations. But Aubrey
                    wanted them to be treated as a division, so I had to clear procedures with them.
                    They were very good at trying to make sure that the employment regulations, the
                    types of projects and so on, were not of a kind for which blacks wouldn't
                    qualify or wouldn't be chosen. Black schools should get into the program and so
                    on. I think ours was one of the early examples of a real effort to integrate
                    blacks into a federal program, although it was at best a limited success. When I
                    had a chance to employ someone in the procedures section I found a very able
                    black employee, I forget who recommended him to me, quite qualified for the job.
                    Before I had him for more than a few weeks, Mrs. Bethune took him into her shop,
                    which seemed to me almost the opposite of what they were trying to achieve. But
                    his move away from an office close to the Administrator and Deputy Administrator
                    to one on another floor was to the immense relief of our southern Deputy
                    Administrator of the NYA, who sort of cringed when he passed my open door and
                    saw a black employee at a desk in the room where I, too, was working. Before he
                    had joined my staff, a secretary had said, “I wouldn't have to take dictation
                    from him, would I?” I said, “You would.” “Oh, I couldn't do that.” I said, “I'd
                    hate to get another secretary, but that's what I'd have to do.” She said, “All
                    right, I'll do it.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Washington as a southern town? You came from
                        Chicago,and this was a segregated southern town, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Very much so. The only place that we could eat with blacks was at one of
                    the departmental cafeterias, the nearest one to the WPA and NYA being in the
                    Department of Interior. We could go but even there it was a self-segregated
                    group of blacks, and they tended to be in the elevator-operator positions,
                    things like that. The town was very southern. My wife and I got an apartment,
                    after we could afford it, in a building no longer in existence, at Connecticut
                    and L Streets. Through our interest in the NAACP, National Association for the
                    Advancement of Colored People, I knew some blacks. I met Ralph Bunche, who
                    became an Assistant Secretary-General at the UN - he was then at Howard
                    University - and Thurgood Marshall, who became the first black justice on the
                    Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, we invited Ralph Bunche over for dinner and somebody warned me, “ You'd
                    better make sure that he is allowed to come in the front door, take the
                    elevator, and so on.” So I went to the manager of our building, and I said that
                    we were having a professor from Howard University over for dinner on Saturday,
                    that he was black and of course he would announce himself and take the elevator
                    up to our apartment. And the manager said, “Well, he could take the service
                    elevator, couldn't he?” And I said, “No!” He said, “It is absolutely standard
                    here, we have a black elevator operator, but he is in uniform. Your man will be
                    coming in civilian clothes and blacks aren't allowed.”</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Well, I had another friend who was working for the National Recovery
                    Administration's construction division, whom I had met through friends in
                    Chicago. He was a construction expert and had mentioned to me just a few days
                    before that there probably wasn't a building in Washington that met all the
                    safety and fire requirements. I said, “What's wrong with this building?” “They
                    don't have windows at the ends of the corridors that they are supposed to have,
                    they have one elevator for too many people, there is a cafeteria on the ground
                    floor and its flue doesn't come out properly, it's a fire hazard to the
                    building, and so on.” I said, “Are we in any danger?” “Not any more so than
                    people in any other building.” So I just filed this absent-mindedly in the back
                    of my head. But when the manager started to tell me about the service elevator,
                    I said, “You know, we've been very worried, a lot of the time — my wife was
                    pregnant — about the safety of this building.” He said, “What do you mean?”
                    “There are no windows at the ends of the corridors, there are too many people
                    per elevator, there is a very grave danger of fire from the cafeteria
                    downstairs, so I am troubled as to what I should do about this, whether I should
                    report these major building code violations.” He said, “Mr. Asher, don't worry
                    about those, we'll get around to taking care of them sometime, all the buildings
                    are the same around here. And you won't have any trouble Saturday with your
                    guest. It will only be once anyhow, won't it?” I said, “No. I also know Walter
                    White, the executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement
                    for Colored People, and he is going to stay overnight with us in another month.”
                    He shook his head sadly, but rent- paying clients weren't overly abundant in
                    those days and he didn't want to evict us. His was the standard attitude in
                    Washington.</p>

                <p>ASHER: They were then called Negroes, southerners wouldn't capitalize it,
                    northerners and westerners did. Yes, although now I am trying to think whether
                    this was token representation. We made an effort to mix. Housing patterns were
                    different, that made it hard. By and large the blacks we knew were clustered
                    around Howard University and a few other places. The New Dealers were in
                    Georgetown, Cleveland Park, Cathedral Heights and the suburbs.</p>
                <p>The wife of my friend who was the construction expert at the NRA was very active
                    in the NAACP, so through them we met many of the leading blacks in Washington.
                    We saw them socially at the home of Gertrude and Peter Stone. But not at every
                    gathering in northwest Washington. I think part of it was simply that people
                    were too tired at the end of the day to come by public transportation to a place
                    as inaccessible as some of the Georgetown places. Even today, if you have to
                    change buses...</p>

                <p>ASHER: No. At that time, we lived in an apartment and then in Bethesda. The early
                    New Dealers were rhetorically integrationists, but in practice couldn't do
                    much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of Aubrey Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: He was an Alabama-born farm boy, who I guess was a good enough student to
                    get into some college. He became a social worker and dedicated his life to
                    trying to do something to help the poor, the needy, the down-trodden. He and
                    Harry Hopkins both loved horse-racing, and tried to get to the races from time
                    to time, a diversion totally out of keeping with their normal dedication...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along with J. Edgar Hoover.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. But that was Aubrey's recreation. I didn't think he was terribly
                    bright, especially compared to Hopkins, but I appreciated his willingness to
                    lean on other people. He was a good fighter for good causes. He went on
                    afterwards to become an officer of the National Farmers Union. He was an
                    impatient guy, as was Hopkins. Neither he nor Hopkins had any kind of tolerance
                    for staff meetings that lasted for more than about 15 minutes. I thought that
                    was a good thing, though I modified my opinion somewhat later. I came to realize
                    that it was important to keep all the staff up to date. They thought that if
                    they kept their key people informed that that was enough, let them worry about
                    the rest of the crew. Aubrey was a good family man. He had four sons, all fine
                    fellows. Lived out in the country. As I say, I liked him, but it was sort of a
                    business relationship. He was a poker player, which I wasn't, and before I left
                    the NYA, I told him I was going to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>He said, “You are cutting off my right arm”, all that stuff, and I said, “Aubrey,
                    look, you've got so-and-so and so-and-so, all of whom you play poker with, and
                    see regularly outside of the office, this can't be so terrible.” He said, “Those
                    guys I play poker with, I would never expect a serious answer to a serious
                    question from them. I don't think you should leave yet.” I said, “The War
                    Production Board is in business, I've got a chance there, we are on our last
                    legs here.” He let me go, in fact he wrote a beautiful letter for me. He was
                    very loyal to his friends and co-workers. He was not a particularly good
                    Congressional witness. Both he and Hopkins had a notion that if they answered
                    all questions in congressional hearings, the transcript would come back and
                    somebody like me or somebody else could then doctor it to make it sound right.
                    If there were figures, we'd just put in an asterisk and say “Subsequent research
                    or something of the sort has revealed that the correct figure should be this
                    instead of this.” And the Democratic Congress accepted this kind of tinkering,
                    where sometimes you almost made the person say the opposite of what he had
                    actually said. Hopkins and Williams were not particularly concerned with what we
                    did to the transcript. It was a rush job, and an after- hours kind of thing. I
                    don't think that was really the right way to run a railroad, but we did it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Until the Lend-Lease Administration agreed to establish a civilian supply
                    program in North Africa, which was right after the landings in October of '42
                    and I left the WPB in about January of '43 to go to North Africa for the
                    Lend-Lease Administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about War Production Board.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ASHER: The War Production Board was another one of these hastily erected agencies
                    without reference to civil service regulations. It was a two- or three-headed
                    monster initially, when there was both an industry and a labor man at the head
                    of it, until Donald Nelson took over. Leon Henderson, whom I did know because he
                    had done a stretch at WPA, was the head of the Office of Price Administration
                    and of the Office of Civilian Supply in the War Production Board. A strange
                    administrative arrangement, but he was now the head of our Office of Civilian
                    Supply. He had a good deputy, an intelligent, driving deputy, Joe Wiener, a
                    lawyer from New York, as acting head of the Office of Civilian Supply in the War
                    Production Board. Our job was supposedly to protect the civilian economy from
                    excessive drain of personnel and supplies. If you turned every maker of
                    automobiles into producing tanks, nobody would be around to produce cars for
                    hospital needs, police and fire department needs, and so on. We were supposed to
                    protect the civilian economy but, in effect, we were leaders in cutting it back,
                    because the Army and the Navy officers who were making the demands didn't really
                    know much about the civilian economy and they assumed that all sorts of
                    activities were essential, which really weren't.</p>
                <p>If you want me to talk about what I did, I was the representative of the Office
                    of Civilian Supply on an internal committee of the War Production Board, the
                    Clearance Committee, which had to clear all orders for the curtailment of use of
                    scarce materials in various activities. We put steel under allocation, we
                    reduced the production of automobiles severely. It was the best cram course in
                    the American economy that I could possibly have because we were worried about
                    everything from tractors to bread-slicing equipment. We cut out bread slicing by
                    bakeries and then caused more problems because people bought new knives to cut
                    their bread at home. In total, they used more steel than would have been used
                    for slicing at the wholesale level. Probably cut more fingers, too.</p>
                <p>That was one less successful order initiated by Civilian Supply. But all these
                    scarce chemicals that I couldn't even pronounce that were absolutely essential
                    for the production of batteries, protection of clothing, etc. were placed under
                    allocation and were allocated by someone in the War Production Board for
                    essential purposes. We'd have to agree as to whether a proposed order made
                    sense. One of the things I learned, that was most important for all of my
                    future, was that there has to be some kind of escape or appeals clause in every
                    order. Sometimes that was my chief contribution, because, initially, we would
                    receive orders that had been drafted by an industry division in War Production
                    Board, and sometimes reluctantly concurred in by the Office of Civilian Supply.
                    Despite the input of industry experts we'd get 10 telegrams the next morning,
                    “What idiot who never saw the inside of a steel mill put out this order? We
                    don't keep our records in this way. We can't possibly keep our inventory this
                    way.” And so on. The steel people in the industry division which had drafted the
                    order were supposed to help in those situations. And they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I learned that ours was a big country, very diversified, from little shops to big
                    retail establishments to department stores, from little producers to giant
                    producers, and all of them had a role to perform and you had to take account of
                    this when you were establishing regulations. It was very valuable later in life,
                    too. It was hard work to get briefed on each of these things. The WPB
                    standardized stationery sizes and cooking utensil sizes. Paper had been made in
                    a million different dimensions; we decided that the 8 � x 11 page should become
                    the standard size. Some types of personal stationery and legal papers could be
                    smaller or larger. Standardization made production much easier, because with
                    fewer sizes manufacturers could produce longer runs and use less labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much of this stayed after the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paper sizes now, with copiers and all this, essentially
                        there artwo, there is letter size and legal size. You did it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: And many other economies of the war. A lot of industries brought marvelous
                    displays for us when we tried to cut production. Silk was needed for parachutes
                    and things like that, and therefore we cut out the production of silk underwear,
                    silk stockings, and so forth. Well, all those clothing people came to the
                    Clearance Committee with their brassieres, panties and other samples, put them
                    on the table for us, showed us that things had to be that way. They made a
                    heart-rending case for business as usual; they couldn't stop their production
                    and infuriate American women.</p>
                <p>And shoe polish cans, we wanted to save the metal, but the shoe polish producers
                    made a wonderful case and brought all varieties of shoe polish to our meeting. I
                    was on the Clearance Committee for Civilian Supply, somebody else from the Army,
                    somebody from the Navy, somebody from labor, somebody from industry and somebody
                    from the Legal Division. The shoe polish makers put on a display for us to show
                    there is nothinyou could put shoe polish in except metal cans. In other
                    materials it seeps through, it leaks, it does all sorts of terrible things.
                    Rightly or wrongly, they persuaded me and others that they had sort of a case
                    for an exception, but with a ceiling on production. They didn't have to produce
                    shoe polish for every kind of shoe everywhere. It was a great experience,
                    learning about everything from pots and pans and stationery to automobiles and
                    steel and chemicals that were essential in a lot of industries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds that you had, in a way by having gone through the

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, and I think that the War Production Board got a lot of its employees,
                    of course, from the New Deal agencies, many of which were closed or reduced in
                    size during the war. Roosevelt said he became “Doctor-Win-the-War,” whereas he
                    had been “Doctor- New-Deal” before. Now we were in the war. And we had to be
                    dedicated to winning it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say in early '43 you were off to... what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The Lend-Lease Administration was established earlier, to obtain supplies
                    for the Russians and the Brits and other allies. After the North African
                    invasion, a team of people was appointed by the Lend-Lease Administration to go
                    to North Africa. Their function was to see that there were enough supplies to
                    prevent disease and unrest behind the lines. There had been a landing in French
                    North Africa [Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia]. Great Britain had established a
                    headquarters in Cairo. The civilian population behind the military lines was
                    poor, mostly Arab plus some Berber groups in the Atlas Mountain regions. And
                    there was a residue of French civilians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about “behind the lines,” there were the
                        Germalines and then the American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Behind the American. Allied Force Headquarters was established in Algiers,
                    under Eisenhower. We Lend-Lease employees became the import division of the
                    North African Economic Board, which was under Allied Force Headquarters.</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ASHER: Tunisia was part of our French North Africa Territory, for Lend -Lease.
                    Well, we had one lone airplane that would come over Algiers while I was there.
                    It tried to drop a bomb, but we weren't in any danger in Algiers. Fighting was
                    still going on in Libya, in that area, but ours was basically a holding
                    operation while they got ready to go through Sicily and Italy. One of the early
                    things we civilians were asked to do was to draft a plan. The military with its
                    customary secrecy told us, “Make a plan for an island of about 4,000,000 people
                    in the Mediterranean, we can' tell you the name of it but it should be a
                    civilian supply program for that area.” Obviously Sicily, we worked on that.</p>
                <p>But in North Africa, there were problems with the French Colons, who had been
                    there for many years. Most were terribly reactionary people. I was billeted with
                    an elderly French family who couldn't have been nicer to me but thought the
                    Arabs were dirt. My landlord told me they were not real people. Then I went down
                    to the concierge in our building, to her tiny room in the basement, and she had
                    pictures of Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill and de Gaulle prominently displayed on
                    her wall. I was talking to her and she said, “They don't know anything about the
                    Arab population here. They don't talk to us, they treat us like dirt.” She gave
                    me a real insight into what later resulted in the independence movement.</p>
                <p>One of our problems, because we were working largely through French people, was
                    to make sure that supplies given to them were allocated with some concern for
                    everyone who needed those supplies. We brought in some very simple stuff, for
                    instance, basic pharmaceuticals, materials for making crates for packing and
                    shipping dates, some textiles, and so on. I did one study of methods of
                    distributing imported supplies and there was a lot of anti-Semitism as well as
                    anti-Arab sentiment among the French. There were a number of Jewish merchants in
                    the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a sizable Jewish community in North Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, it later became a problem for Israel, but at the time, was a problem
                    for us, in that our supplies were distributed through what were called
                    Groupements, by function. Clothing supplies, groceries, and so on by different
                    groupements. I tried to focus my study on how they made the allocations, to make
                    sure that there wasn't serious discrimination taking place. It was pretty hard
                    to get at.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>A humorous experience. I went down deep into the desert territory, where there
                    were some oases and date palms. There was a strip of concrete about 30 feet long
                    and a lot of Arab women sitting around the edge, mostly with their feet in the
                    big pile of dates in the middle. They were gathering these dates to put into
                    crates to be shipped. I noticed that there were an awful lot of date seeds down
                    there. I talked to the French manager showing me around. I said, “Do they eat a
                    lot of dates before they pack them?” He said, “Yes.” I said, “Can you do
                    anything about that?” He said, “I did. I tried to start fining them for the
                    number of date seeds that I found on the ground after they left, and it was
                    wonderful, it ended the problem. But about six weeks later I got letters from my
                    customers in Marseilles who said, 'Tell us more about the two-seeded dates that
                    you're sending.'" They'd eat a date, shove its seed into another date, pack it
                    with the rest, and send it off to Marseilles. I realized that there were all
                    sorts of ways of getting around a disciplinary measure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll stop at this point. I'd like to talk about the next
                        time, before we move on, dealing with the French administration. How we were
                        running things there and maybe there is something else you would like to add
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 29th oNovember, 2000. The French were nominally,maybe more than
                    nominally, in control where you were, weren't they?</p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. We were in what was called French North Africa, in fact Algeria where
                    the headquarters was, was a province of France. We had responsibility for
                    Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia. Responsibility as Lend-Lease territory, not legal
                    responsibility. We were part of the Civil Affairs section of Allied Forces
                    Headquarters, headed by General Eisenhower, whose political advisor was Robert
                    Murphy, an old line, distinguished, pre-war and post-war diplomat. Murphy had
                    made some of the agreements with the Vichy French by which the allied troops
                    landed rather peacefully in North Africa. One thing in my mind that gave me a
                    lot of respect for Bob Murphy was that he was perfectly aware that a lot of us
                    were critical of the arrangements that he had made with reactionary, Vichy-type
                    Frenchmen. We were working six and a half days a week at that stage and he
                    volunteered to spend a Sunday morning with any people who wanted to ask him
                    questions about how he got to where he got. With no holds barred and no
                    subsequent recrimination, or sending anybody home or demoting them or anything
                    like that. We had a frank, three-hour session. It was wonderful. I forget the
                    details, but what did impress me was the case he made for what he had done.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I'd been there several weeks before this session and I was billeted in an
                    apartment building with a French Colon family, a very reactionary one. They were
                    terribly nice to me because they had a son fighting in French Indo-China and
                    they sort of adopted me as a replacement. Which made it very pleasant. I was
                    able, from the commissary or PX, to bring my breakfast foods home, eat at the
                    apartment, and leave a bit for them. So they got a fresh egg occasionally, or
                    toast and jam which we were able to get from the PX. But, when I went down five
                    floors to talk to the concierge, who was an Arab but spoke very good French, I
                    got a different story about the landings, and was told that just contacting the
                    transport union would have meant that they would either call a strike or make
                    the port of entry easy to enter, not a life-threatening one for American troops.
                    She had pictures of Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill and de Gaulle on her wall.</p>
                <p>I think there was a real class difference in feelings about how we handled our
                    political relationships prior to the landings, with the French Colons not
                    dissatisfied in the least, and glad to have the troops. Everybody was glad to
                    have the troops there. But the literate non-French population there was
                    critical. But again, as I say, they were so glad to have troops that we got
                    along well. I got to know Bob Murphy a bit, and later in the war, when he was
                    again in Europe. I don't think there were very many divisions within the
                    miscellaneous group of civilians from different wartime agencies that were part
                    of the Civil Affairs section. There were maybe some people from agriculture, who
                    were still Department of Agriculture. As I must have mentioned in connection
                    with that episode of double-pitted dates, part of the job of the Import Division
                    was to see how the civilian supplies that we brought in were being distributed,
                    that they had a system that could be called equitable or at least fair to the
                    minorities and fair to places outside of Algiers and Casablanca. And they did,
                    by and large, have such a system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was running it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It's a good question. Nominally, the French administration.In practice,
                    the U.S. military was probably playing a heavy role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any of the tension... When we, this is a year
                        later when we landed in Normandy, the U.S. had been training a civil
                        government people in Charlottesville, Virginia, and De Gaul heard about this
                        and was going to have none of it. And very quickly made it clear, and by
                        every means possible took over the French government. He was not going to
                        have France treated as an occupied country. Did you run across any of that
                        in Algiers, or was this still the early days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was there before Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, and those two French
                    generals met in Casablanca, but I wasn't at the Casablanca meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beautiful handshake, Giraud and De Gaulle.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, as I remember it, de Gaulle and Giraud became co-heads of the French
                    Committee of National Liberation in French North Africa, and that did
                    temporarily clear the atmosphere a bit. We found the French prickly to deal with
                    both in North Africa and later when I was on the continent. But Eisenhower was a
                    very good politician. In Algiers we were in joint headquarters with the British,
                    who as you know were more sympathetic to De Gaulle and his Free French than to
                    our albatross, General Giraud. Well, I wasn't high enough in the political
                    negotiations to have any share in all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering if you had seen any manifestations at your
                        leveof French- American, and French-British antipathy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The French ran a much better military mess for eating in, and there was
                    always some transportation, when we went deeper into North Africa, to pull in at
                    a French mess rather than at a U.S. one. We had token, maybe I shouldn't say
                    token representation, buI think that's really what it was, oFrance in the
                    headquarters at all times. I think they felt they weren't full partners, and
                    they weren't. But they had virtually nothing to bring to the North African
                    Economic Board. That was known and it was a tough period in history. I think de
                    Gaulle got his glory afterwards, as much as he deserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem with the French, getting out aid, food
                        and all this, to the great majority of the population being the Arab
                        population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That was one of our worries. There were some difficulties, and they may
                    have been greater in things like pharmaceuticals, which were scarce. It might
                    have required some rationing in order to save the most important medicines to
                    serve the best interests of the population. But I think with more U.S. and U.K.
                    personnel, probably, than we needed (until they began to pull out and move to
                    Italy) one was able to keep a fair hand on the situation. There is no question
                    that North Africa was better off after we left than before we came. This was in
                    large part due to the defeat of the Germans farther east than we were. I made
                    some good friends among the French, I could speak a bit of French. They may have
                    been especially pro-American, I don't know. But I didn't detect enormous
                    tension. Maybe it was because I didn't have 20:20 eyesight. I don't think it was
                    a period of enormous tension and I haven't read much that would indicate that it
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I haven't either. You were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Until December of 1943.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was supposed to come home to a job, I was still a Lend-Lease employee.
                    But while I was away, Lend-Lease, the Board of Economic Warfare and the
                    incipient relief organization, the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation
                    Operations, the nucleus of what later would become UNRRA, were combined into
                    something called the Foreign Economic Administration. I was supposed to get home
                    in a hurry, but I was a civilian; military personnel had higher priorities. I
                    got sent to Casablanca from Algiers in the expectation that I would catch an
                    early troop ship back. But it got delayed for various reasons, and there I was
                    in Casablanca, which by the way can be pretty cold in December, with my summer
                    clothes. Came back on a troop ship that landed in Norfolk, Virginia, after
                    midnight on Christmas Eve.</p>
                <p>I went to work in January at the Foreign Economic Administration, which was
                    administratively still in chaos with that change. I became deputy chief of
                    something called the Planning and Control Staff for Liberated Areas, allegedly
                    having had experience in a liberated area. We had a lot of brilliant people,
                    including some refugees who had good knowledge of what might be strategic
                    targets in Italy and Germany and in Western Europe, until it was liberated. But
                    it wasn't a very satisfactory period as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>ASHER: January of 1944 until September or October, when I was taken over by
                    UNRRA, to work in its Displaced Persons Branch. The idea being that we would be
                    involved in the repatriation of displaced persons, slave-camp labor, prisoners
                    of war, and so forth, in Europe. Again, there was a delay in transportation. I
                    thought I was going to get to Europe very early in the fall, but the troop ship
                    on which I went didn't get off until November. We landed 10,000 troops and 81
                    civilians on a bitterly cold day in northern Scotland. It was an interesting
                    example again, of both the advantages and disadvantages of advance planning. For
                    24 hours before we landed we'd been getting instructions that group A should be
                    on C deck aft at 14:02 hours, group B should be on B deck forward at 14:03, etc.
                    It all seemed to be very well planned, except that they didn't mention the
                    civilians at all. When disembarking began, it was clear after about 20 minutes
                    in the cold that, at the rate we were going, our ship would be tied up in port
                    for 24 hours. So some brilliant young captain shouted out over a megaphone from
                    the shore, “Will all the rest please get off single file!” Then our ship was
                    cleared in no time. And the military personnel quickly found their units and
                    joined them. There was only a limited area in the port there.The civilians
                    huddled around aimlessly, until a very efficient British Royal Transport officer
                    came up and said, “Who's in charge of the civilians?” And I said, “Nobody, they
                    are on their own on this trip.” He said, “Well, somebody's got to be.” I said,
                    “You are going to have to appoint someone.” He said, “Alright, you are in charge
                    of the civilians.” I said, “What do I do?” He said, “You come with me and I give
                    you a chit for your name plus 80 civilians. We reassemble on this train track
                    over there and we are going to leave within an hour. You don't have to do
                    anything, except tell the civilians that you've got their ticket.” So he wrote a
                    ticket that said “R.E. Asher and 80 civilians”. Then I got up to make the
                    announcement, and there was such a howling wind I thought I'd better make it in
                    several directions. I got on a box and said, “You don't know me, but I am Bob
                    Asher. I have your tickets to London, we go on that train, it goes within an
                    hour, you find yourself a seat and when you are asked for your ticket, you just
                    say 'Mr. Asher has it.'" Then I thought, what else should I do? So I said, “Are
                    there any questions?” My God, 67 hands went up. First question: “We are with the
                    USO [United Service Organization], an entertainment unit. We have these big
                    theatrical trunks, we can't get them out of this ship and carry them over to the
                    train. What are we going to do about that?” I said, “That's a very fair
                    question, let me find out.” I went and found out from the same office that
                    issued me theticket. They said, “We'll take care of that, let them direct us to
                    the luggage.” I came back triumphant, thinking I had solved most problems, and
                    said, “Just tell them where the baggage is and they'll get it on to the train.
                    Are there any other questions?” There were still 45 or 50 hands up. “We are
                    nurses and we are not scheduled to go to London. We are supposed to be in
                    Leeds.” I answered that off the cuff, “All the trains go to London from here.”
                    Which turned out to be true. I was not going to stop everything for that. Then
                    there were still other questions, illustrative of the fact that some people were
                    with the Associated Press, some were nurses, specialists of various kinds,
                    anState Department personnel. All had questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Then we were to stop in Glasgow for 50 minutes and these people all ran off in
                    different directions to send a telegram or to telephone somebody and so on. And
                    an announcement came over the speaker system for R. Asher, “Please appear at
                    such-and-such a spot right away.” I went to the place and was told “There's been
                    a little trouble down the line, we're going to leave in 15 minutes instead of 50
                    minutes, and would you get your group together.” I said, “For that, I've got to
                    be on your speaker system.” I got on the speaker system, said I was R.E. Asher,
                    and I had misinformed them—I didn't want to say anything about the trouble down
                    the linthat our train was leaving in 15 and not 50 minutes, and I would expect
                    to see them under the clock of the station immediately. Not all of them were
                    under the clock, because they had run off to the telegraph office or some other
                    place and some distraught young lady would say to me, “My friend had our
                    passports and she ran off, and I don't want to get on that train without my
                    passport.” I said, “Well, I think they will send the stragglers on the next
                    train, I am sure they will, and I think you should move at the first
                    opportunity.” Those people who were supposed to go to Leeds were still uncertain
                    that they couldn't arrange in Glasgow to go to Leeds rather than London. In
                    short, we had all the crises that 81 different people can have when they are on
                    their own in wartime. But a majority got on the train. It was blacked out, cold,
                    unheated, after midnight. I didn't get any sleep at all, I don't think very many
                    people got much.</p>
                <p>After we got to London and I reported to the embassy saying that if there were
                    people telephoning for me I could be reached at such and such a place. For two
                    or three days after that, I would meet distraught women on the street, some men
                    too, who said, “Do you remember me, I was worried about this-or-that. I just
                    wanted you to know, because I knew you'd be worried too, that my friend got down
                    on the next train and we're together again.” All these people I hadn't been able
                    to recognize because it was pitch dark, but they could recognize me because a
                    light was on me because while I was making my speech...</p>

                <p>ASHER: A wonderful head of white hair named Leo Crowley, who was from somewhere
                    in the Midwest, and who was one of the most indecisive administrators I've ever
                    encountered. He used to listen to both sides very attentively and then he would
                    say, “With all the talent we've got, I'm sure that you can solve this question.”
                    And the people had come in order to have him solve it but he fudged the thing. I
                    don't think he lasted very long but he was there most of the time I was there.
                    The head of the Liberated Areas Branch was a fine man though again not a great
                    administrator, Rupert Emerson, a professor from Harvard who knew a lot about
                    international affairs as compared with some of the people in the organization,
                    who were pretty parochial. He wasn't an administrator, but he was a fine person
                    and you could respect him for his knowledge, even though not for his
                    decisiveness. There was a lot of jockeying between these consolidated
                    organizations, they all had more generals than captains or privates and I was
                    frankly very happy to get out of it.</p>

                        wanted to go see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I think it was more than that. They thought the war was on in Europe and
                    that's where the action was. If you were anything below the age of 75, you
                    thought if I am not in a uniform being shot at, I at least ought to be over
                    there and let them bomb me and do whatever they were doing. It was still a
                    period of B-1s and B-2s raining in London. The rain of B-1s was practically over
                    by the time I got there, but the B-2s were falling.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, that made no noise. Unmanned missiles of a highly destructive
                    character. The B-1s made a humming noise that gave you enough time to get, not
                    necessarily into a shelter, but at least to get your head covered and get down
                    on the floor or somewhere. The B-2s gave no warning and they were peppering all
                    of London and doing considerable damage. But as everyone knows, the British were
                    very gallant, very well organized. It was depressing to see the number of people
                    housed in subway stations, some of them had been there for months. Homes
                    destroyed. And being so cheerful about it, and so decent. It was really a very
                    inspiring sight. London looked terrible, caverns and fragmented buildings all
                    over the place.</p>

                <p>ASHER: From about Thanksgiving time 1944, late November, until I went onto the
                    continent in January or February, I don't remember which, of '45. The period in
                    London, again, was a delay. It was assumed when I left Washington that we could
                    be on the continent assigned very quickly to SHAEF, which was then called
                    Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces. But the Battle of the Bulge
                    changed that, delayed the movement of the civilians onto the continent. So we
                    did a certain amount of marking time. We went to UNRRA headquarters, I was then
                    an UNRRA employee, daily. They didn't have anything for us to do really, they
                    were staffed already. I thought at the time that they could have done much more
                    to enlist us in the work, in the planning, but they didn't. Shortly after
                    Christmas I was assigned to SHAEF headquarters, which were then in Versailles,
                    just outside of Paris. Paris had been liberated. We worked in a crowded stable
                    called La Petite Ecurie, little stable, wired up in typical American fashion
                    with all its statues of horses having wires stuck to their tails, going across
                    to some other part of the headquarters or off into the field. I was assigned to
                    the Civil Affairs [G-5] part of the SHAEF and, within that, specifically to the
                    Displaced Persons Branch. Early in the year, after the intense battle of the
                    Bulge, things began to move pretty quickly in favor of the Allies.</p>
                <p>UNRRA also established, in addition to this sort of beach-head at the
                    headquarters, of which I was a part, a staging area in the town of Granville, in
                    northern France, from which personnel could be called forward by our unit in
                    SHAEF headquarters to staff displaced persons camps X, Y and Z, in different
                    parts of Europe. Actually one person from our Granville staging area was
                    captured by the Germans near there and held until months later. One of the
                    problems was transportation in Europe. Military units had a monopoly on
                    transportation and these poor UNRRA guys, we would tell them, “You are supposed
                    to appear at some displaced persons camp with your gear and prepare to take over
                    this big community.” And they would say, “How do we get there?” We'd say, “Get a
                    truck.” It wasn't until after VE day that we actually inherited enough
                    transportation from the army. I found myself one day signing a chit for 125
                    trucks I hadn't seen. They said, “They are over on that lot.” I said, “I don't
                    want to be in charge of this, we must have an accounting division somewhere that
                    can take this.” I quickly telephoned around and got somebody who was willing to
                    take my word that there were 125 surplus trucks and that they were now the
                    property of UNRRA. And that we'd have to get them from where they were up to the
                    staging area so that they could be moved back to different camps. Incidentally,
                    we were without the kind of repair facilities that the army has for its
                    transportation. There were some British made trucks, some American made oneyou
                    have to drive on different sides of the truck. We had emergency calls: “Our team
                    of five people, two women and three men, is in a broken down truck here in
                    Belgium or somewhere, what should we do?” We would have to authorize them
                    somehow to find some military or other repair facility there, give them a chit,
                    tell them to sign for it, let the facility figure out how to collect later for
                    the work. It was very hectic.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>It was an exciting job, though, because there were, as you know, I forget how
                    many million displaced persons. Really divided into two main groups. Western
                    Europeans — Scandinavians, French, Belgians, Dutcdying to come home, eager to
                    come home, expecting to be welcomed there and so on. And Poles, Yugoslavs, and
                    Hungarians, who were very afraid of going back to Soviet controlled territory.
                    One of the principles on which we operated firmly in UNRRA, very firmly in the
                    military too, though I'm not quite sure that we knew it was a principle, was not
                    to repatriate people against their will. This meant that before very long the
                    camps were pretty well empty of Western Europeans.</p>
                <p>One of the most thrilling days of my life was the 1st of June, 1945, only three
                    weeks after VE day, when I represented UNRRA at the ceremonies in Paris for the
                    repatriation of the millionth Frenchman. Earlier in the year, shortly after my
                    arrival at the displaced persons branch, the research people in it had been
                    asked to give an estimate of the number of people from Western Europe, broadly
                    defined to include Scandinavia, that could be repatriated per day if the
                    transportation, rail, air and truck, bringing forward supplies into Germany were
                    filled with displaced persons going back. We made an estimate of 30,000 people a
                    day. Our general said to us, “Don't make me look foolish to Eisenhower. Is that
                    a reasonable figure? It sounds awfully big to me.” Well, it sounded pretty big
                    to us too, but we said, “It really is. The French railroad cars used to have 40
                    men or eight horses in them and you could get 40 men going back easily” and so
                    on. Within a few days of VE day, we were repatriating 80,000 people a day. The
                    reason was very simple. These people were not going to wait for transportation
                    by train or bus. They “liberated” every bicycle, every wagon, every mule, every
                    sled, everything they could, including souvenirs, and started off for home. The
                    roads were clogged. It was inspiring in a way. Tough on them, but wonderful that
                    they didn't wait. They really wanted to get home.</p>
                <p>For the millionth Frenchman, when we saw that this was coming up, we sent a
                    delegation of which I was not a member, to Luneburg, a camp in Germany, to pick
                    a good millionth man. We didn't want somebody who was going to be accused of
                    being a collaborationist or anything like that. We picked a gaunt Frenchman from
                    Marseilles. He was perfect. Thirty-seven years old, hollow cheeks, six feet
                    tall, wonderful. We said, and I am using “we” not really including me because I
                    was still in the headquarters while they were picking this man in Luneburg, “You
                    are going to be the millionth repatriated Frenchman on the 1st of June, a week
                    from today. It will be a big ceremony out at Le Bourget when you come in off the
                    plane. The Minister for Prisoners of War, Deportees, and Refugees is going to
                    meet you, give you a kiss, some clothing and a little French money.” He said,
                    “That's wonderful, but I've never flown. I'll be as sick as a dog.” We said, “In
                    that case, we are going to pick the millionth and first, and you just stay on
                    the plane until you feel better, and let this other guy get off and get all the
                    awards.” So we had a substitute picked out and ready.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>What we didn't realize was that planes were landing at almost one a minute at Le
                    Bourget, bringing back everything, supplies, personnel and so on. We didn't take
                    the number of the plane that our man was supposed to arrive on, there were plane
                    numbers on the bottoms of the wings. Our assumption was that he was going to
                    arrive at five o'clock. There was an enormous array of military personnel,
                    bands, a Russian general, a British general, an American general, a French
                    general and a French Cabinet Minister — they had a real Cabinet by then. There
                    was some jockeying as to who was going to be in what part of the line, but UNRRA
                    wasn't competing in that. I was just so happy to be there. Five o'clock and
                    there was a plane up there at exactly five, so the band struck up the four
                    national anthems. It was a hot dusty day. Planes were churning up sand and dirt
                    from the field, it was very hard on the eyes, you could hardly see. We were
                    supposed to salute each of these four national anthems. Then the plane landed
                    and our guy wasn't on it. Next plane we did this again. It was only on the third
                    one that our man appeared. We had heard 12 national anthems by that time, and
                    everybody was exhausted. Our hero did arrive and he got kissed and got flowers
                    thrown to him as he was convoyed into the Gare D'Orsay. Speeches were made and
                    more awards given there. The French turned up in large numbers along the route
                    and it was a very inspiring day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into problems with the Soviets trying to get
                        their people back? I know, their troops, it was an awful thing because we
                        were forcing, particularly German, once who joined the Vlasov army, back, or
                        just prisoners, and they were taking back and killed a million.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The Russians were full members of the alliance and demanding that their
                    people be sent back, once identified as Russian displaced persons. These people,
                    however, were in most cases absolutely unwilling to go back. We took a firm
                    stand against forced repatriation. As far as I know, we did rather well that at
                    keeping the persons in camp if they didn't want to depart. We didn't send them
                    home against their will, unless it could be shown that they were real traitors
                    in the sense of the kind of Germans that would be brought to trial at Nuremberg.
                    This the Russian representatives couldn't do of course. The displaced persons
                    were mostly innocent people who'd been swept up by the Germans and put to work
                    for them. The captured Russians were a long time problem. Poles were just about
                    as difficult a problem. Because those who were perfectly legitimate Poles found
                    that half of the country from which they came was now in Russian hands. It was
                    more than a year before all of this was sorted out or inherited by the
                    International Refugee Organization.</p>

                <p>ASHER: We were following the maps of where there were clusters of displaced
                    persons either in camps or not. And sending out the instructions on what to do
                    about them: keep them, wait for further instructions, send them home to France
                    and Belgium and Holland and Norway and Denmark when they were ready to go.
                    Asking about the health of these people. There were some that were in terrible
                    health, although by and large I was surprised, I must say, at the relatively
                    good condition people were in. Disease wasn't rampant, starvation wasn't. They
                    had eaten thin rations but in the last few weeks they had beefed up a lot. It
                    seemed a very hectic period for us because we would get these messages during
                    the night, at all hours, “we have a group that's all ready to go, but if we send
                    the truck, we won't have enough transportation left to get the food tomorrow.”
                    Things like that. But it somehow worked out. We got them a truck or food from
                    somewhere. The military, while they professed to have pretty well turned over
                    their responsibilities to UNRRA shortly after VE day, were fully cooperative.
                    They had become heavily involved in this job before UNRRA took over and they
                    wanted to see it finished right. As a matter of fact we took on to the UNRRA
                    payroll some of the ablest people in our Displaced Persons Branch who were
                    involved in this. Charles Schottland, for example, a colonel in the military
                    displaced person's branch, who later became, under Eisenhower I think, Secretary
                    of Health Education and Welfare. Other fine military personal were taken onto
                    the UNRRA payroll, more than a couple. Some were eager to get out of uniform and
                    into some civilian capacity, simply because they thought that they would get
                    home quicker that way. We had to hold off a bit, let them find their own level,
                    but the Displaced Persons Branch of SHAEF was integrated, between civilians and
                    military personnel. After VE day we continued to operate fairly well.</p>
                <p>I moved to Frankfurt about the middle of June '45, I guess. The SHAEF offices in
                    Versailles were abandoned and Allied Force headquarters was in the IG Farben
                    building, one of the few undestroyed buildings in Frankfurt. I was billeted in a
                    house that had obviously been recently evacuated by the Germans. I felt a little
                    bit guilty when I found a wonderful library at that home, the inhabitants having
                    had to leave without getting a chance to carry with them any of this. But war
                    wasn't kind to people and the military, U.S. and British, felt quite rightly
                    that they had to have some place to billet people. So, evacuate the Germans and
                    billet the Americans and British. That's what they did. Depending on your rank,
                    you could be pretty well billeted. They may have hired back some of these
                    Germans, as interpreters, kitchen personnel, mechanics and so forth.</p>
                <p>I just happen now in 2001 to have some correspondence with a professor of German
                    at the University of Massachusetts, who apparently as a very young child was in
                    Frankfurt and was evacuated at the time when we came in. She has relieved me, we
                    didn't force them to leave at the time of SHAEF's arrival; their house was
                    bombed before and they were already on the outskirts of Frankfurt. Being an
                    occupying power isn't very enjoyable either. Maybe some people found it so, but
                    not those of us who really weren't wounded during the war or hadn't starved, and
                    who moved with the troops in pretty classy ways. It just didn't sit well with
                    me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of UNRRA, who United Nations was it at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: UNRRA's headquarters were in Washington and it had a European Regional
                    Office in London. At headquarters we had a Russian deputy. It took a long time
                    before we got Russian administrative personnel into the field. UNRRA had
                    missions later in Byelorussia and the Ukraine. They were not headed by Russians,
                    in keeping with the principle that an UNRRA country mission should not be headed
                    by a national of that country. The Russian deputy felt, and I think with reason,
                    that he was left out of a lot of decision-making, but the Russians were very
                    troublesome when they were left in. Terribly hard, they just saw things
                    differently. Politics for them was the continuation of war by other means. They
                    had a real grievance that all the Western Europeans were being repatriated while
                    these Russians who should have been at home helping with reconstruction were
                    still in camps, trying to get visas for the USA, Argentina, Brazil and all sorts
                    of western hemisphere places. And getting them. A distinguished American,
                    Herbert Lehman, had been head of the predecessor of UNRRA, the US Office of
                    Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations, and he was succeeded in UNRRA by
                    Fiorello La Guardia, a colorful, brilliant, dynamic, exciting personality to be
                    around, but erratic as an administrator. He would fire somebody in the morning
                    and in the afternoon he would ask for that person and be told, “Well, don't you
                    know he left?” and he'd say, “Get him back, I need him.” La Guardia then was
                    given some important post with military government in Italy I think.</p>
                <p>His successor aUNRRA was a man named Robert G.A. Jackson, Robert God
                    AlmightJackson we called him. Do you know anything about him? He was a New
                    Zealander. Very dedicated person who revved himself up for the whole war and
                    postwar effort. In the military service he had been a commander. He thought of
                    UNRRA as a sort of command-post job. He was here in Washington then, it was the
                    headquarters. There was a staff meeting every morning. He usually slept on a cot
                    in his office as though it were important that he be there between midnight and
                    five AM. But the war was over by then. He, I thought, didn't have too good a
                    sense of proportion. He would have on his agenda when he would get to the
                    morning office meeting, I am getting a bit ahead of myself, that the flag wasn't
                    flying straight and somebody should do something about that, and where are those
                    drugs for Albania that pharmaceuticals had promised? That was obviously much
                    more important than whether the flag was flying straight or not. His agenda
                    always had a checklist on it that somebody important should get busy on right
                    away.</p>

                <p>He married a person whom I found utterly charming, Barbara Ward, a brilliant,
                    eloquent, beautiful economist. I didn't really know her at all until well after
                    the war, when I was a founding member of the Society for International
                    Development. Barbara Ward came into the organization early and she was one of
                    our most eloquent people. She'd written a book called The West at Bay, and she
                    later got interested in the development of the less developed countries, in
                    particular Africa. When she spoke honestly about the situation in Africa it
                    brought a lump to my throat, tears to my eyes, a determination to do something.
                    She was wonderful. Her husband I admired in some ways, but Barbara I loved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were dealing with the headquarters, were any
                        nationalities giving you particular problems? Either because of internal
                        politics of their country, or just being difficult to get to go from here to
                        beyond.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: UNRRA was the first operational international agency. It had a real
                    function in the field. Every country felt that it was entitled to have some
                    personnel at the headquarters. They were willing to supply them. UNRRA needed to
                    build up fairly quickly. It operated at headquarters only in English. This was
                    probably a severe handicap to a lot of people. It was hard, much harder to build
                    an integrated international staff of collaborative personnel, it takes longer,
                    takes more effort in bringing out people at staff meetings, etc. The Personnel
                    Division had people like Mel Spector, who were very aware of this, very good at
                    trying to give us team spirit, so to speak.</p>
                <p>I was brought back from Europe to be head of a division called Procedural
                    Coordination to issue UNRRA's regulations and principles and so on. One of the
                    things I tried to do, with the full understanding of Jackson and other people at
                    the top, was to get the clearance and consent of all of the key officers in the
                    organization before getting out some new regulation. You never could get the
                    Russians to agree that people should be repatriated only with their consent. On
                    the other hand, you could persuade them that this regulation was going to apply
                    to a lot of other people, and if you don't go along you are going to slow down
                    the repatriation of people in other countries. There was still an aura, a
                    residue of combined forces, of having together beaten the Nazis, and it carried
                    over a little bit to the UNRA headquarters. I had some good Russian and Yugoslav
                    friends. It was not quite the same kind of intimacy that you got with American
                    and British colleagues. I think that the people at the top of UNRRA were
                    sensitive to this problem, but it's just much easier to pick up the telephone
                    and talk to somebody in English, who will then go along with the proposed
                    action, or want to qualify it, or disagree or something, than it is to explain
                    it to someone brought up in another culture.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fallout if I understand it, was that you did as much
                        as you could and then you start getting into these DP camps. When I came to
                        Germany in '55, they were no longer DP camps but they were refugee camps.
                        The same thing. They really didn't get rid of them until about around 1960
                        or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It went on forever, long beyond the life of UNRRA. Therwas, what is it
                    called, within the UN...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High Commissioner for Refugees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, the IRO [International Refugee Organization] took over the displaced
                    persons problem from UNRRA. There was a sense of urgency at home about putting
                    an end to some of these wartime agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you started this were you aware that no matter what
                        happened you were going to end up with major residue of people who weren't
                        going to go anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was, and I think others were. I think we realized that we were going to
                    have a hard core of persons who couldn't be repatriated but we didn't know where
                    they should go or what should be done about it. Therefore some of these people
                    who had suffered the most during the war were the last ones to be released from
                    the camps. Many were never repatriated. A handful went to Brazil and a handful
                    to Canada and some other places. Israel came into being and took on a lot of
                    displaced persons who were Jews from the concentration camps. But war in the
                    Middle East created a horde of new refugees. It wastill is — a very sad and
                    terrible situation, as I said. Thousands of people who suffered badly during the
                    war and had every reason to hope that at the end of the war they would be able
                    to rejoin their families, get back to somewhere, were being held because they
                    wouldn't or couldn't go to where they weren't wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eventually, Congress passed the Displaced Persons Act. And
                        ayou say there was Brazil, Australia...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: The U.S., too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and other countries were looking to do this. Was this

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>ASHER: Just the beginnings of it, because I came home towards the end of 1945 to
                    UNRRA headquarters here. I was here for a year. By that time, that late in the
                    year, it was perfectly clear that we had this large group of persons in
                    displaced persons camps and that those people would have to be maintained
                    somehow. The U.S. did take in what a lot of us thought was an inadequate number,
                    but nevertheless not insubstantial. When you look at university faculties even
                    today, you realize how many of them were refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back you were back in the U.S., '45-'46 in
                        UNRheadquarters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did people there understand the enormity of the problem?
                        Maybe not in your office, but people who you were working with, was it hard
                        to get them to understand it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It was hard but not impossible. By that time transportation had freed up
                    some, and many of these people had for one reason or another gotten abroad and
                    more people were coming back from abroad. It was hard for them to understand the
                    restlessness and the impatience, the dangers imposed by all the factional rifts.
                    One of the problems was, particularly among Eastern Europeans, that there were
                    different political factions within the same camp, and you had to sort of
                    separate them and put them in different camps if you could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was giving refugee relief visas in '55 and '56 in
                        Germany, in Frankfurt actually, and we had those from the old Russians, the
                        new Russians, the Yugoslavs, the Croats, the Serbs, all of them hating each
                        other, all of them denouncing each others to be communists or fascists or
                        sometimes both, it was a mess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Very early into the thing, I went to a camp, I can't remember exactly
                    where it was, but it had a lot of Poles. I was charmed by some Polish youngster
                    who was raising rabbits. A marvelous little scene. But, I went in to talk to his
                    parents and they told me, “Communists over here, don't talk to them.” We had
                    these divisions and it was clear that we really would be in trouble if we didn't
                    do some separating of them. Even the communist Poles and communist Yugoslavs
                    didn't get along very well together. There were Titoists and there were
                    Stalinists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself, wither you or your office beginning
                        to lobby Congress, to say, we could take a good share of this, or did you
                        not get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>ASHER: I didn't get involved in that. I'm not sure that we did this as
                    energetically and as persistently, as effectively as we should have. There was
                    this feeling, and I had it, I think others did, that this international agency
                    shouldn't be lobbying particular countries. It was supposed to be somehow above
                    that kind of fray. It was all right if La Guardia wanted to testify, or Herbert
                    Lehman or Commander Jackson, but it wasn't a good idea for the staff to be
                    running around sheltered in employment by their international status, trying to
                    tell the U.S. Congress...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time you really felt you were international?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. I felt it in SHAEF, because that was at first bi-national really, but
                    we had enough Frenchmen around to make us think we were an international
                    headquarters. We operated with certain words, we spoke of lorries, we even
                    adopted a few French words into the military vocabulary, and I felt it more
                    strongly when I got home. Here I was in this international agency in Washington.
                    There were others before it, the Pan-American Union and so on, but I was a new
                    convert, I guess, to this international status. I felt it somehow required a
                    little different kind of behavior than when I was in the relief agencies of the
                    U.S., able to write testimony and so on.</p>

                <p>ASHER: Yes, it was na�ve, but we harbored some hopeful feeling that we could. I
                    was, I guess, somewhat ambivalent because I knew right away from the divisions
                    with the Russians and so on that this wasn't going to be one world. And yet,
                    that bright, nice blue flag inspired me.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>ASHER: UNRRA's functions diminished as we had the handful of semi-permanent
                    displaced persons taken over by the High Commissioner for Refugees. I was
                    offered a job by the State Department with the Mission for Economic Affairs in
                    London, which was within the embassy framework. Headed by, when I got the offer,
                    Tom Blaisdell who had been in the War Production Board and I knew him from that.
                    His deputy, Paul R. Porter, and his colleague, Theodore Geiger, were old friends
                    of mine.</p>
                <p>The rationale for maintaining a Mission for Economic Affairs was that there were
                    some temporary economic agencies headquartered in London. One called the
                    Emergency Economic Committee for Europe was dealing with certain economic needs
                    of Europtimber, for example — long before the Marshall Plan, that is two or
                    three years before it became operational. There was a European Coal
                    Organization, which was trying to allocate U.S. and Polish coal to those
                    countries in Europe that needed it. Another organization called the European
                    Central Inland Transport Organization was trying to deal with the sad fact that
                    Germany had corralled all the railroad cars that were in Europe and repainted
                    them. And the Dutch, the Danes and everybody wanted their cars back. Identifying
                    and allocating them was one of ECITO's jobs. So there were these three “E
                    Organizations” they were called, emergency organizations, with the U.S.
                    represented in all of them by personnel from the Mission for Economic
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>Among the things I was expected to do was to represent the U.S. in the Emergency
                    Economic Committee for Europe, which had representation from these former
                    governments of countries that were based in London during the war, what did they
                    call them — governments in exile. The executive secretary of the EECE was a very
                    able Englishman named Eric Wyndham-White, who later headed the GATT [General
                    Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. So we had an international committee, and we
                    discussed a lot of the economic problems of Europe. Curiously, after trying for
                    weeks to get myself on the State Department payroll from UNRRA, I was told,
                    “Well, you were there all the time. Because when you left Lend Lease they put
                    you into State Department status and gave you a leave of absence for UNRRA. You
                    didn't really have to go through all this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in London from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: From November 1946 to the middle of 1947. Yes, when the UN got going and
                    the Economic Commission for Europe was established, I was a member of the first
                    U.S. delegation, along with Paul Porter of our London office. Under Secretary of
                    State Will Clayton headed the delegation. Our mission, shortly after the first
                    session of the ECE was moved to Geneva. We became the U.S. Resident Delegation
                    to the Economic Commission for Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in London, you were there of course in the
                        early days, but it seems that British took longer to pull out of rationing,
                        even than Germany and France.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>ASHER: That's true, they were very slow about doing this. But the result was to
                    put a better lid on the maldistribution of income and privilege, I think. And
                    there was a more orderly process than the black markets that flourished in
                    continental Europe. Not that there weren't any black markets in Britain, but the
                    British were</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More disciplined</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Much more disciplined. And the country was badly damaged. Well, there was
                    damage all through Europe, there is no question about that, but people forget
                    that the British were also trying to become more of a classless society than was
                    true of other places. And the Labor Government was strong. Labor felt reasonably
                    strong in the coalition government under Churchill, and stronger still after the
                    electorate booted out Churchill, to the surprise of a lot of American observers.
                    London was a sort of European capital in those early post-war months. It was
                    exciting to be in for a lot of reasons. Not only the resumption of additional
                    theater and music and cultural programs, the reopening of the museums, but also
                    because there were many European continentals there, and the planning of large
                    scale reconstruction was a big job. The U.S. was considered to be, and rightly,
                    the source from which most of the supplies were going to come. The situation
                    didn't get better, as you know, very quickly, and the Marshall Plan was a
                    belated but marvelous answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling at that time while you were in London
                        that thU.S. wasn't rising as much as it should have to the occasion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. But, we were also aware that the U.S. itself was sort of demobilizing
                    from a war-time economy. The U.S. population had been denied its automobiles,
                    its brand new tires, its canned goods and all sorts of things, needs that
                    politically had to be satisfied. Roosevelt's sudden death was mourned throughout
                    the world and Truman hadn't come in with a golden reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. You stopped Lend Lease right there after the war had
                        ended,the ship's turned around.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>ASHER: Truman was very anxious to get back to what he thought was normalcy. And
                    it was possible to do so in the U.S. He wasn't eager to be the first president
                    not to let private relief do the job abroad, as Herbert Hoover had done after
                    World War One. So the programs of the temporary agencies were somewhat starved.
                    But, one knew that you couldn't turn the government around in two weeks. I think
                    most people were reasonably patient. There was a Greek-Turkish aid program in
                    1946-47, I think, but nothing called the Marshall Plan until well after that.
                    There was plenty to do in London and some friendships were made that served us
                    well when we did get into the Marshall Plan period, or when we began work in
                    Geneva or UN Headquarters in New York. For severalyears I kept running into
                    people I had known in London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was really built up was an international cadre.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. These three emergency organizations in London were folded into the
                    Economic Commission for Europe when it came into being as the first regional
                    organization of the UN Economic and Social Council. As I recall it now, I think
                    it was in the spring of 1946 that the UN sent abroad a mission called the
                    Temporary Subcommission on Devastated Areas. One group came to London. One part
                    went to Asia. The London team was headed by a good economist, Isador Lubin, who
                    had been a Commissioner for Labor Statistics under Roosevelt and then an
                    anonymous assistant at the White House. I worked with them for several days. Our
                    people were headquartered at the Mission for Economic Affairs in the London
                    Embassy and, because they had worked with the so-called “E Organizations,” were
                    becoming well-informed on the needs of Europe, the supplies available, which
                    were shortest, what kinds of priorities should be established, and so on...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you are talking about Europe you are talking about
                        what wrefer today as “whole Europe,” including the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. But it was pretty clear from the UNRRA experience that the Soviets
                    were going to demand things but they wouldn't be willing to supply information,
                    to have missions come to them to ask questions, and so on. If all this could be
                    arranged under the U.N., it might give them some cover and some protection, but
                    basically they weren't prepared for the U.N. personnel either. They were
                    sovereignty-conscious to the n-th degree. Very difficult to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Geneva, and that was what, '47?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. The first session of the Economic Commission for Europe was in May, I
                    think, 1947. We had high hopes for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were on the American delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, on the U.S. delegation. Low man, far down on the ladder. We had, as I
                    said, pretty high hopes, especially when Trygve Lie, the first Secretary General
                    of the UN, named Gunnar Myrdal as the Executive Secretary of the Economic
                    Commission for Europe. Myrdal had a good reputation in the U.S. as the senior
                    author of “The American Dilemma.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Race.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, race. And as a sociologist and economist. He later won a Nobel Prize.
                    Both of them did, he and his wife Alva Myrdal. He took the ECE job on the
                    assumption that the UN would be the agency collecting and distributing relief
                    for the devastated areas of Europe. But the Russians made that impossible. It
                    was clear from the first session of the ECE. They were on the minority side on
                    everything and holding up decisions and action. They made long speeches, some of
                    which were irrelevant, some of which were relevant from their point of view, but
                    they did not want some other organization to have the say. The result was that
                    Clayton and the people at the head of the U.S. delegation were persuaded by the
                    end of the first session that if the U.S. were to get involved in a major relief
                    program, it wouldn't be through the UN. And that was not an arbitrary decision.
                    It was pretty well forced upon us by the behavior of the Eastern Europeans at
                    international meetings. The beginning for me was my experience at UNRRA, but
                    that experience was dramatically enhanced in the UN itself when that got
                    underway.</p>
                <p>The U.S. decision in a way set the Economic Commission for Europe adrift.
                    However, it not only stayed in being, but it became a model for the Economic
                    Commission for Latin America. And if those two regions had economic commissions,
                    there had to be an Economic Commission for Asia, and eventually, an Economic
                    Commission for Africa. That's how international politics works, even though
                    those others had to some extent less rationale for coming into being when they
                    did.</p>
                <p>The Economic Commission for Europe became somewhat of a backwater as the main
                    drama for European recovery moved to Paris and the Marshall Plan. Fortunately,
                    Averell Harriman was named both the US Special Representative in Europe and U.S.
                    Representative on the Economic Commission for Europe. So he called on us to keep
                    the two organizations from getting into conflict, and find things for the
                    Economic Commission for Europe to do that wouldn't get in the way of the
                    Marshall Plan, but were worth doing. Among other things, the ECE standardized
                    the road signs for Europe and the rest of the world. One doesn't realize that
                    all those symbols that go with “STOP, Dangerous Crossing, Slow-down, Pedestrian
                    Crossing” and so on, were not in being until the Economic Commission for Europe
                    got busy creating and standardizing them.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>After Paul R. Porter, our chief in Geneva, left to become Marshall Plan director
                    for Greece, I inherited the US Resident Delegation to the Economic Commission
                    for Europe. One day our road transport expert came to me with a wonderful idea.
                    He said he'd like to propose building a tunnel under Mont Blanc at a meeting of
                    the ECE Transport Committee. He told me all about it, I was incredulous at
                    first, not being an engineer, but he told me why this was perfectly feasible and
                    would only cost a few billion dollars. Therefore, could he propose it? I said,
                    “Absolutely not. That's a wonderful idea, but you get the Europeans to do it.
                    The first thing that's going to happen if you propose it, is that they're going
                    to believe that this is something the U.S. is ready to finance, and I am telling
                    you it isn't ready to finance.” In the end it got built, with European funds,
                    and this gentleman can rest happy that he was one of the first to see this
                    possibility. I have to live with the fact that I never let this come up in the
                    way it was first proposed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: No, I think in the early part the French were fine. Their first
                    representative to the Economic Commission was Andr� Philippe, who was a
                    socialist. The British had socialist members in their delegation. We had ex-New
                    Dealers in the American resident group. We all got along very well. And the
                    Dutch were very helpful. They were a small country. And Norway and Denmark too,
                    couldn't be accused of trying to dominate anything and they tried to provide
                    good personnel and used them to work constructively. It was interesting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: What Harriman wanted was for us to come to Paris for the periodic meetings
                    of his country Marshall Plan directors. Paul Porter and I both went to all
                    Marshall Plan chiefs' meetings. We reported on what was going on in Geneva and
                    we got the benefit of 16 very encouraging reports on what was going on in each
                    Marshall Plan country. To the extent that we could absorb and understand it, it
                    became part of our expertise in Geneva. Harriman himself came to the full annual
                    meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe. He didn't like Geneva
                    particularly, he couldn't wait to get out of it usually, but he did come. He
                    gave us stature, so to speak, in Geneva. In 1950 I came home to work in the
                    European Regional Affairs Division in the State Department.</p>

                        how diyou find both Switzerland and the Swiss?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>ASHER: Well, Switzerland was absolute heaven after London. It was undamaged, it
                    was a well-run little country, its food was absolutely delicious — London at its
                    best was not then known for its cuisine —and the Swiss had spectacular scenery.
                    Wonderful little inns and hotels all over. Wonderful transport system. One
                    Sunday when we were going skating at one of those mountain resorts near Geneva,
                    I accidentally left my billfold on the ticket-counter at the railroad station in
                    Geneva. I was naturally terribly worried, we were already on the train. When I
                    came back in the evening I rushed back to this window and asked whether anyone
                    had heard of a billfold that had been left there, and I described it. The
                    ticket-seller said, “Yes, of course. We have it.” I said, “Thank you so much, to
                    whom do I owe my thanks for this?” And he said, “Why shouldn't you have it? It's
                    yours.” He couldn't understand. It was an honest country. This couldn't happen
                    in Italy at that time, or France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Swiss as hosts for the
                        organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: They were stand-offish. They had had the League of Nations and they were
                    pleased to have the successor organization. But they were neutral themselves,
                    proud of their neutrality, and not members of the UN. We tried to start, with
                    some success, a Swiss-American Society or something like that. But the Swiss
                    members tended to be those who had an American wife, a brother in the U.S., or
                    some other relative. We had some social meetings. Our landlords, of course, the
                    property owners, were Swiss, willing to make more than a buck out of the influx
                    of foreigners. So, it was mixed. I don't think we really made many close Swiss
                    friends. I had from Lend-Lease days in North Africa, an expatriate Swiss friend
                    who had been at the university in the U.S. and stayed there. Although you never
                    lose your Swiss citizenship, you know. He had told me he had a sister living in
                    Geneva and she and her husband were prominent there. Of course I looked them up
                    and out of obligation to their brother they had us over for a great dinner and
                    treated us very nicely, but it was clear that they had their social circle and
                    they were not about to bring us into it. And I must say, we weren't all that
                    fluent in French. It wasn't surprising to me that they went their own way.</p>
                <p>Shopkeepers were a different category, they were of course delighted to have
                    people with purchasing power coming in and out. I took many people to watch
                    companies in Switzerland and those companies were glad to sell watches but very
                    secretive about their production processes. In the end, it cost them their watch
                    business because Timex and people like that made watches that cost 15 or 20
                    dollars and kept better time than 150, 200 and 400-dollar Swiss watches. But
                    buying a Swiss watch was the aim of every visitor who came to Switzerland
                    between 1947 and 1950.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1950, you came back to Washington and you were a part
                        of thState Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. European Bureau. We had one unit called European Regional Affairs. It
                    was headed by Ed Martin and Doug MacArthur II. They were concerned with the
                    Marshall Plan, NATO, the Economic Commission for Europe and general regional
                    affairs. It was an interesting business to get back into Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Cold War was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It was very much there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Czechoslovakia, and Berlin airlift and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Well, the Berlin air-lift and the Czechoslovakian crisis wergoing on while
                    I was still in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I was saying, these already set the stage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. Divided Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your concerns in this Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: They were concerned, inter alia, with keeping track of the general
                    progress of the European economy. The Marshall Plan as you know was administered
                    by a separate organization. As Europe grew richer, we were beginning to plan for
                    some of the so-called “less developed countries,” then just coming out of the
                    colonial status. I went to the first meeting, I guess I was appointed, I don't
                    know who arranged the delegation, but I went from our part of the State
                    Department and the Economic Affairs Department to the first meeting of
                    thEconomic Commission for Asia and the Far East and the Economic Commission for
                    Latin America. Another job within Regional Affairs was to be sort of liaison
                    with the UBureau of State insofar as Europe was concerned. The UN Bureau was
                    headed by Francis Wilcox and then by Dean Rusk who later became Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rusk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Rusk! When was he Secretary?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '61-'60-something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, I was out of State by then. But he had been head oUN Affairs. A very
                    solid guy, who had come from the Rockefeller Foundation, I think. Impressive.
                    Later I came to disagree with him substantially on Vietnam, he was the greatest,
                    last-ditch defender of the U.S. position on Vietnam. But the Regional Affairs
                    section of the European Bureau, I think, was effective and respected. It had
                    some very able people while some of the other European units had people who were
                    still trying to find their role in the postwar world. Ed Martin, Doug MacArthur,
                    Miriam Camps, Ruth Phillips, Lou Boochever and others constituted a very good
                    group. Young people for the most part, energetic, and they got involved in all
                    sorts of problems that strictly speaking may not have been European regional
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>Another problem was that NATO was being established. North Atlantic Treaty
                    affairs were a regional problem and Doug MacArthur was our expert on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, one of the great accomplishments of American
                        foreign policy was the sponsoring and pushing of what eventually became the
                        European Union. Jean Monnet and the Coal/Steel Community which grew into the
                        European Community which grew into the common market and all that. Was
                        that...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. That was incubating in that period. It was a very exciting part of it
                    and it was a divisive part. Because the “one-worlders” in the UN part of the
                    State Department and the old-time nationalists in other parts of the State
                    Department were very concerned about this establishment of supra-national ties
                    within Western Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Building up a rival to the U.S.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes and to the UN. Jean Monnet was, as you know, a brilliant spokesman,
                    very effective and well-connected throughout the U.S. and Europe. It was his
                    vision, his drive that was largely responsible for the early progress of
                    European integration. NATO brought European governments together, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you fit in personally in this spectrum of
                        “nationalist”“one-worlder?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>ASHER: I was a one-worlder until the Russians disillusioned me. And very much so.
                    I was an enthusiastic supporter of the global organizations, but I became
                    persuaded that building smaller blocks was in certain respects a better way to
                    approach integration than to try and do it all at once, when we were obviously
                    living in a divided world. It was further divided between the developing
                    countries and the so-called developed ones. That too became, as you know, the
                    source of a lot of tension in international agencies. I became a willing, eager
                    convert to European integration first, and globalization as a longer term
                    visionary thing which we could work at but which wouldn't come into being for a
                    lot of years. It was reasonably clear, once we got the issue of Germany more or
                    less settled, that European cooperation could proceed rapidly. Monnet, of
                    course, saw immediately that integration of the German economy was essential to
                    the rebirth of Europe and the ending of Franco-German wars. I was glad to work
                    on the OEC[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] which grew out
                    of the Marshall Plan and is still functioning today. As for the Western European
                    Army versus NATO, I was more protective of NATO and I didn't see much
                    opportunity for another international army within that NATO framework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with these European Affairs 1950-what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I was formally in the European Regional Affairs shop for only about a
                    year. Then I became a special assistant to Willard Thorp, the Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. He already had one very competent
                    special assistant, Bob Schaetzel. We became good friends. I worked for Willard
                    Thorp and his successors until 1954, when I left the State Department for
                    Brookings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about leaving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. Our Economic Affairs area was very active untiSecretary Dulles came
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1953, Eisenhower administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. I was a great admirer of Dean Acheson. He was a tough, clear-seeing,
                    articulate State Department spokesman. I had been in Paris with the first U.S.
                    delegation to the UN General Assembly in the fall of 1948, when Mr. Dulles was a
                    part of the delegation. He was absolutely confident that the '48 election would
                    bring in a Republican president, namely Dewey, and that he would really become
                    head of the delegation. There was an embarrassing period when he was just there
                    and Acheson remaineSecretary of State and Truman was elected President.But after
                    Eisenhower's election in 1952, Dulles became Secretary and brought with him his
                    passion for security pacts with every “free” country in the world as an
                    anti-communist measure. I couldn't see this. Partly because of my broad
                    international outlook, and partly because it seemed too much like an elephant
                    and a rabbit being harnessed together. A U.S. security and mutual defense treaty
                    with Ecuador or a small weak country elsewhere just didn't seem to me a very
                    realistic thing. Dulles talked to departmental employees about “positive
                    loyalty” and getting behind him. I think he rightly had reason to expect that
                    State Department employees would fall in cheerfully with his views. I felt that
                    if I didn't, it was not a good idea to stick around and, if I could go
                    elsewhere, I would be happier and so would the State Department.</p>
                <p>Brookings had just committed itself to a big five-volume series of books on the
                    United States and the United Nations. They were doing a fat volume on the UN and
                    economic and social cooperation. They called it “The United Nations and
                    Promotion of the General Welfare.” They offered me a temporary job, a contract,
                    to produce a couple of chapters for that. That gave me a bridge at least to get
                    out of the State Department and still have something to do.</p>
                <p>My old boss Willard Thorp, who had been the Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Economic Affairs, was administering a large grant from the Merrill Foundation.
                    Charles Merrill of Merrill Lynch had given a lot of money to Amherst College and
                    along with it, Mr. Merrill had given a base on Long Island, a wonderful summer
                    home, which was to become the Merrill Center for Economics with Willard L. Thorp
                    as Director. Willard invited me to the first and second summers there, in 1954
                    and '55, to be a kind of secretary for the distinguished rotating group of
                    economists who were invited to come there and discuss inflation and other world
                    economic problems. They ate well and they talked well and none of the problems
                    were solved, but considerable light was shed on them. And I was provided with a
                    nice place to live and work and learn.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did McCarthyism hit you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. Tangentially and via friends, who were targeted much more openly than
                    I was. I was served an interrogatory, I think that was the first stage. I had to
                    put down all the organizations I ever belonged to, what I did in them and so on.
                    The charge of associating with communists was based on my wife's brief
                    membership in the Washington Bookshop. She had taken some graduate courses in
                    labor economics at American University, and she bought where the books were
                    cheapest. What was very fortunate was that we were both sensitive to the
                    communist issue from our Chicago experience with the Workers Committee on
                    Unemployment. My wife discovered very quickly that the Washington Bookshop was
                    sort of a communist front, that they pushed the books that were written by
                    fellow travelers. She had written them a letter saying, “I want to resign from
                    the bookshop, I am not in sympathy with the way things are going. Please take me
                    off your mailing list, cut me off.” She had saved her pencil draft of this
                    letter, which I was able to produce and show that we were on to it and that we
                    were very sophisticated about fellow traveling organizations. Also I had been
                    involved in the pre-war period in some anti-communist, liberal organizations,
                    including a forerunner of Americans for Democratic Action, the Union for
                    Democratic Action. Ethel and I were involved in the Washington office of it. One
                    of the objectives was to get clear of some of the communist baggage that was
                    involved in the early New Deal period. Anyhow, I went through a few weeks of
                    extreme discomfort, but I was cleared. I guess I could have stayed with the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it help to sort of sour and encourage...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. It did not help my feelings and the Secretary of State was talking
                    about positive loyalty. Our new Secretary for Economic Affairs, Sam Waugh, who
                    was a Nebraska banker, was a very innocent person and a very nice person. I had
                    been a special assistant to Willard Thorp, so Mr. Waugh sort of inherited me and
                    Bob Schaetzel. I went in the first day he was on duty and said, “Have you been
                    sworn in yet?” He said, “No. What do I have to do? Get a notary public?” I said,
                    “No, there's usually a ceremony in the secretary's office or assistant
                    secretary's. Let me see what I can arrange.” He said, “Can I look at State
                    Department papers until then?” “Not classified papers, but you are here and I'd
                    be happy to talk to you and everyone else will, too.”</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I called Dulles' office and they were very decent and we set up a time for the
                    swearing-in in a few days. I told Mr. Waugh, “This is a good chance to send your
                    wife a corsage and to invite your friends.” My God, he invited everybody from
                    Nebraska, it became embarrassing. I'd been to several of these things under
                    Acheson and he was always very gracious, even though he may inwardly have
                    resented the time and energy spent on these ceremonial occasions. With Mr.
                    Waugh, his wife, his friends and some staff, we assembled in a large room
                    adjoining the Secretary's office. Mr. Waugh had asked me just what would happen
                    there, I had said, “Well, the Secretary will make a gracious speech about good
                    it is to have you on board and how important the economic affairs job is, and so
                    on.” I didn't realize then that Dulles didn't give a damn about economic
                    problems. And you will have to say, how pleasant it is to be aboard, how much
                    you look forward to working with him on important economic problems, etc.” He
                    said, “Will you write it down for me?” I then gave him a page and a half, mostly
                    generalities.</p>
                <p>He had this in his pocket oyellow paper when he went up to the secretary's office
                    for the swearing in. His wife came along and all these Nebraskans were there.
                    After we'd been waiting long enough to get little impatient, Secretary Dulles
                    came out of his office with Mr. Simmons, who was then the Director of Protocol.
                    Dulles said to Mr. Simmons, quite audibly, as they were coming out of his
                    office, “What are we here for now?” And Simmons said, a bit less audibly,
                    “Swearing in of Sam Waugh.” “Oh that!”, said Mr. Dulles. After the oath of
                    office had been administered by the Chief of Protocol, Secretary Dulles said,
                    “We're glad to have you on board.” Long pause. “You'll be here as Assistant
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs and there's plenty of work to do.” Period. End.
                    Mr. Waugh looked at me and reached for his speech and I shook my head. He got
                    the idea and simply said, “I am very glad to be aboard, Mr. Secretary. I am
                    hoping to work with you and the other people here.” It was a disaster. It was a
                    flop. That was early in my experience of Mr. Dulles. I really sort of held that
                    against him as a singularly ungracious welcome for a man who was eager to work,
                    who didn't know the Washington routines, and who deserved a warm public welcome.
                    But then I really felt more badly about Dulles's demand for what he called
                    “positive loyalty.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did that when he first...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: His first speech to us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Positive loyalty.” That rings to... everybody who lived

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That's right. That's exactly right. It was particularly humiliating in
                    economic affairs, because Dulles simply did not think our work was very
                    important. We had perhaps grown complacent, maybe arrogant even, thinking that
                    doing something about the economic situation in Europe particularly, but also in
                    the less developed countries was virtually the number one job for the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Brookings for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Nineteen years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, this moves beyond, but I'd like to catch a bit.
                        How did you see, during these 19 years, '54 to '73, what was the role of one
                        of these think-tanks, such as Brookings, what were you doing in it, as
                        regards to foreign policy mainly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I had several leaves of absence for international agency assignments. Did
                    at least a six months job for the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome,
                    when they were trying to put together a regional, largely agricultural,
                    development scheme for the entire Mediterranean region. And having been in North
                    Africa before, they put me in charge of the Morocco-Tunisia team, to design a
                    program for the agricultural development of those two countries, in concert with
                    other Mediterranean country teams. Because one of the dangers foreseen by FAO
                    was that Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, everybody, would say, “We
                    can export oranges or olives or both. We can grow them, we can export them.” But
                    you can only produce a certain number without flooding the market. If Spain
                    could market in late spring and Morocco in early spring, that would be
                    reasonable. But, it's not reasonable to have all the countries moving into the
                    same agricultural commodity for export at the same time.</p>
                <p>I had that leave of absence. I had two or three other shorter leaves to do other
                    special jobs. I went back to State to serve for a couple of weeks on a UN
                    committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Brookings was a research organization. It took us quite a while to get out our UN
                    series. Ruth Russell's volume on the UN Charter may be the most enduring part of
                    the multi-volume series. We worked very closely with people who had either
                    recently been in the State Department or had been professors of international
                    relations in universities. We had a Foreign Policy Studies group in Brookings,
                    and an Economic Studies group. They overlapped. Basically, Economic Studies was
                    thought of as concentrating on our domestic economy. And we also had a political
                    science group, which was called Governmental Studies. Brookings at that time was
                    the only think-tank in Washington that I know of, other than the National
                    Planning Association. It was relatively small. It had an endowment. It was
                    founded by Robert Brookings, who was a St. Louis businessman who came to
                    Washington during the First World War and was appalled to discover how little
                    the government knew about the economic affairs of the country and vice-versa,
                    how little the industrialists knew about government. He dedicated a large part
                    of his fortune, and his personal interest, too, to the establishment of an
                    institution that would do more to make the public aware of the problems of our
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have a cast of as being sort of the democratic one,
                        or wait...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it sort of seems to be considered as heritage of
                        thfoundation, a bit on the liberal side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes. At the time that I first went there it had a cast of people who were
                    not involved in the New Deal at all and were in fact opposed to a lot of it. But
                    with the shrinking of the New Deal economic and social agencies, and the broad
                    shake-down of government after World War II, Brookings did get a lot of former
                    New Dealers. Another thing is that the people who came from the government,
                    unlike the academics who had been at Brookings before, were activists. They
                    wanted Brookings to produce something that would have some effect. Originally,
                    Moulton and Ed Nourse, the first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors,
                    thought of Brookings as just a study group. They produced two monumental works,
                    certainly, in the early days of Brookings, long before I came there, namely,
                    “America's Capacity to Produce” and “America's Capacity to Consume.” Two studies
                    that were very important and influential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way some of these think-tanks have served to be,
                        maybe it's not the best term, but half-way houses between people who were
                        leaving government, but waiting to get back in. I am sure right now, we are
                        talking about the end of November 2000, we don't even know who is going to
                        be our president yet, but the think-tanks all over town here, you got people
                        who are wearing a dark suit and a conservative tie every day to work just in
                        a case they might get the call.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>ASHER: You are absolutely right. When the Kennedy administration came in, in
                    1961, it was to some extent the beneficiary of this half-way house notion.
                    Brookings and others had sheltered a number of people during the Eisenhower
                    years and released them back to the Kennedy administration. But the think-tanks
                    also have a function of their own, I am convinced, that's worth doing. To some
                    extent I think the labels liberal and conservative are unfortunate, although
                    probably unavoidable. We tried hard and I thought succeeded to a considerable
                    extent to tackle a problem, see how it shapes up, give all the facts and
                    arguments against whatever solution would be proposed and, of course, those in
                    favor of it, so that the reader who doesn't come to the same conclusion as the
                    writer has at least the facts on which he can base a different conclusion. I
                    thought that was a fair way of doing things. But it's hard to state the
                    rationale for something one doesn't believe in as cogently and as persuasively
                    as the rationale for the side one does believe in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Brookings institution faced both ways, one towards the
                        political and the other towards the academic, or was it more towards the
                        political?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: I think it is both ways. Some of our finest people were still associated
                    with universities, on leave or sabbatical, or even people like Charlie Schultz
                    or Art Okun. Art, who had taught at Yale, started Brookings as a full time
                    member of the senior staff, but Charlie kept on teaching at the University of
                    Maryland. Certainly many of them come from universities and in some cases go
                    back to universities. I came without academic ties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it really is a genus type-thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: That's exactly the right word. We, at least I, felt should be careful
                    about making our people too accessible to government. Otherwise government would
                    think of us as a holding company, to produce personnel for them needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until into the '70s, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Until '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Kennedy administration, how they used it.
                        What about the Nixon administration? Were you still a player, were you sort
                        of ignored, or how? I mean you as the Institution.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>ASHER: Nixon wanted our files rifled. At the time of Watergate, one of the places
                    that he wanted to get the records of was the Brooking Institution. We had a few
                    people who actually went into or came from the Nixon administration, but it was
                    a much cooler relationship than under even his predecessor Eisenhower, because
                    Eisenhower was not a politically partisan person at all. Another tension at
                    Brookings was between long-term studies and short-term things. Should you try to
                    influence next week's or next year's policy decision on something, or is the
                    bigger problem to understand the whole American tax system and to design
                    something that will be more equitable, more manageable, and a better tax system.
                    When I first came to Brookings it was producing fat books. They were not popular
                    in academic circles, but they were basic reading matter, particularly for
                    faculty members, who then could regurgitate them in more palatable doses to
                    their students. But the pressure was to be relevant, in order to raise money,
                    which Brookings had to do, too, for its studies and you couldn't do that as
                    easily for a long-term project as you could on matters that would be next year's
                    problems.</p>
                <p>I ask myself now, when I go back for retirees meetings and dinners and so on, and
                    I am on their e-mail list, a troublesome question: Brookings has somebody ready
                    to pronounce a view on television almost every day of the week. We get email
                    notices of this, and invited to participate in a conference call at 12 o'clock,
                    and I worry about whether the Brookings experts are getting sort of myopic and
                    too busy with the short-term stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the wish food of messing with present day policy
                        is totempting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: It's too tempting. And it is true, initially the endowment plus Ford
                    Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation funds enabled us to do those three-year
                    studies. But that kind of money has dried up, so what are you going to do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you sort of retired in '74? You've been doing all
                        sorts othings since then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, just about as busy ever since until quite recently. After producing
                    with Ed Mason oHarvard a big book on the World Bank called “ The World Bank
                    Since Bretton Woods,” which was one of those longer-term projects, trying to put
                    into perspective the work of the World Bank, I retired from Brookings. One of
                    the first things that came along was that the World Bank was interested in
                    starting an Oral History Program and I helped launch that. I did a half a dozen
                    interviews, got paid for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zechler or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, begins with a Z.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember meeting him 15 years ago, seeking his advice on
                        how tdo these things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Zlatech or something like that. He is a very nice fellow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very nice guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ASHER: Yes, he gave me a chance to go right back to the Bank wherI'd been hanging
                    out for three years, with an Oral History Program.</p>
                <p>Then a totally different kind of thing came along. The University I think it was
                    of Southern California, wanted to establish a public administration
                    degree-granting branch in the District of Columbia. And the organized academic
                    community of the District, by which I mean George Washington University, Howard,
                    the University of Maryland and so forth, was not eager to have another
                    degree-granting institution available locally. Somehow, I don't know how, the
                    District of Columbia decided to establish a committee to advise them on this
                    question. They got somebody from the University of Maryland, somebody from
                    George Washington University and from Howard U. and then they thought, “Maybe we
                    should turn to Brookings for an objective chairman.” So I got tagged for that.
                    It was a very short job. The chief problems were: does the new institution have
                    an adequate library, is it a well-rounded institution, and so on. We were pretty
                    uneasy, it really wasn't an institution that should be granting M.A.s and
                    Ph.D.s. But they provided that it would really be just a way-station of the
                    University of Southern California. And the people would really get their degrees
                    there and they would come here for such work as involved them in the national
                    capital. We compromised on letting them give master's degrees, waiting till
                    later to rule on Ph.D.s. It was a job for which I had no particular competence,
                    except I had been around universities and I knew enough to work closely with my
                    fellow committee members.</p>

                <p>Also, Brookings hired me right away as a consultant for a wonderful job. I was to
                    go around and look at schools of public policy. They were a relatively new
                    phenomenon in the early '70s, and I was asked to find out: a) what they were
                    doing, and b) whether there were ways in which Brookings and they could work in
                    harmony on joint projects. I got to see Michigan, Stanford, Berkeley and other
                    fine institutions. It was a great trip. Also very interesting, because there
                    were established schools of public administration which had basically just
                    changed their names to public policy and introduced one course called Policy
                    Making or something like that. There were places that capitalized on the fashion
                    for schools of public policy and really had two people from their political
                    science department established as a center, trying to get money separately for
                    that. All of them were eager to get from Brookings a Joe Pechman, who was the
                    country's best expert on tax policy I guess, and Arthur Okun, who was a highly
                    respected economist and ex-Chairman of the Council of the Economic Advisors. In
                    exchange, they would offer from their faculty what I described in my report as a
                    promising young shortstop and a utility outfielder. But the main thing that
                    killed my report, because I thought that there were quite a few possibilities
                    for collaboration, was the feeling of the directors of foreign policy and
                    governmental studies and economic studies that “We can get Ph.D.s who are
                    qualified and experts in our fields, why should we fiddle around with somebody
                    the University of You-name-it can release for a little while,” and so on. We did
                    develop one or two projects in which work could basically be farmed out to some
                    university. Or we could take a young student and be a host to him while he
                    worked on his Ph.D. on a subject of interest also to Brookings. He would, of
                    course, acquire access to our foreign policy experts, or tax experts, or
                    anti-trust personnel. But, basically, I got six or eight weeks paid vacation
                    going around to these places, coming back and writing a report, on which the
                    Brookings trustees complimented me. Nothing happened that I know of. Since then
                    I continued till recently to pick up paying jobs of a short-term nature.</p>
                <p>To summarize, I've had 20 wonderful years working for the US Governmenabout 10 in
                    domestic service and 10 in foreign service; 19 years with a great research
                    institution, Brookings; and 13 or 14 years as a free-lance consultant. I've
                    enjoyed almost every minute of my working life. Government service can be
                    frustrating, but it can also be very exciting and satisfying. At the moment, it
                    may not have much appeal for bright young graduates but I urge them to consider
                    it seriously.</p>
