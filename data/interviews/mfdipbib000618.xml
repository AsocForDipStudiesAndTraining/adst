                <p>STEPHANIE SMITH KINNEY</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Monique Wong</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 8, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Monique Wong on November 8, 1992. I'm interviewing
                        Mrs. Stephanie Smith Kinney in Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mrs. Kinney, I'm very glad to be here. I understand that you came into the
                    Foreign Service with your husband in 1971. Perhaps you can tell me how you two
                    arrived at the decision of coming into the Foreign Service. Any discussions?</p>
                <p>KINNEY: Okay. When we were introduced at a cocktail party in Cambridge in the
                    latter part of 1969, I guess, Douglas was introduced to me and made the comment
                    that he was hoping to go into the Foreign Service. And I laughingly said yes,
                    that's what I thought I'd do one day too. He didn't ask me at the time, but as
                    we courted and eventually got married, he took the exam and was offered an
                    appointment to the Foreign Service. We had to face the decision about whether
                    this was what we wanted to do. It was a choice between the Foreign Service, City
                    Bank, or AID. There was some lengthy discussion.</p>
                <p>This was in 1970, a little time short of the famous '72 Directive on Spouses. But
                    there had been announcements in the paper in 1971 that there were changes coming
                    in the Foreign Service and after much discussion, we decided that we would do
                    it, my assumption being that, “Well I'll take the Foreign Service exam and come
                    in and be a Foreign Service officer. We'll go around the world being officers
                    together,” it never occurring to me that things might not turn out that way. In
                    part because this had been a long-term interest of mine and ended up somewhat as
                    a vindication for my aspirations that had been thwarted as a 16-year old.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My high school in central Florida in the early '60's, 1961 to be exact, taught us
                    to write research papers by giving us a really dumb topic. The topic was “What I
                    Want to Be When I Grow Up.” For reasons that I don't remember, it occurred to me
                    to write about being a Foreign Service officer. So I sent off to the Department
                    of State and got all sorts of information and gathered pamphlets and read books
                    and found a person in Winter Haven who was a retired Foreign Service officer and
                    interviewed him. But the fruits of my efforts and my research were discouraging
                    as I recorded in the last paragraph of the research paper which went something
                    along this line. “And so if you're a young girl who hopes to have both a family
                    and a career, it would appear that the Foreign Service is not for you. It
                    appears that the only way for a married woman to make it in the Foreign Service
                    is to marry a successful officer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: That was in 1961. So I didn't think anything of it. I thought, well
                    that's the way the world is, and I put that aside as a possible career
                    possibility and went about my merry way. I went to Vassar College and spent my
                    junior year in Spain where I became quite enamored of things international and
                    knew that I wanted to work in the international area but figured that probably
                    teaching Spanish or history and working as an academic might be the only
                    particular route. I met Douglas some years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's when you were in Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>KINNEY: It was after Harvard. I was teaching at a private school in Boston and he
                    had just come back from the Peace Corps in what was then Upper Volta and had
                    returned to the Kennedy School to get an MPA, Masters of Public Administration.
                    We courted for a very short time, were married, and the next year he finished up
                    school and we had to make career decisions. And I was absolutely elated because
                    word had just come out in the newspaper that the State Department was changing
                    its directive on married women and married women would indeed be allowed to join
                    the Service. So we came to Washington in I think it was September of '71 and he
                    started his A-100 class and I took the Foreign Service Exam in October, the old
                    exam when it was given on a predictable date. I was elated some month or so
                    later to be told that I had passed. I took the oral exam and was thrilled to
                    death to be told that I was the second married woman who had ever been admitted
                    into the Service at that time. So I was thrilled to death, but I had to wait on
                    the list the same as everybody else, and I had been interested in USIA, being a
                    water lily floating on the sea of culture, essentially I thought that would be
                    the metier for me. But President Nixon at that time, having little faith in the
                    younger generation, put a freeze on hiring for junior officers. This was the
                    period of Vietnam and he figured he didn't need any more rabble-rousers in the
                    government than he already had and was interested only in hiring mid-level,
                    reliable journalist-types that he felt would tell the kind of story he was
                    interested in about the War. So I accompanied Douglas to Mexico, which was his
                    first assignment and kept myself busy down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had already passed the exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I had passed the exam when we went to Mexico, yes. And I was waiting
                    essentially to be called, but then this hiring freeze was put on. I didn't know
                    how long that would last, but I figured I would have to find something else to
                    do in Mexico. I set about getting the house set up and after I'd done all that
                    and gotten to know the city and so forth, learned a very important lesson which
                    is a family rule now. When in doubt, go. Because Douglas wanted to drag me to
                    some American Veteran's do one evening, and I wanted to go to that about as much
                    as I wanted a toothache. But he said, “Oh, please, come on. It's very important
                    to them. We have to have some representation from the embassy.” He was the
                    ambassador's staff aide by this time, for Bob McBride, who was really one of the
                    wonderful old-style ambassadors. So I reluctantly went. I happened to meet a
                    marvelous woman by the name of Louise Honey at that party who, finding out my
                    background, my interest and desire in working immediately offered me a job as a
                    history teacher at the Colegio Americano. There was just one problem. Diplomatic
                    spouses weren't allowed to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? In Mexico.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: In Mexico. In any place, but particularly in Mexico. They had worked
                    unofficially and under the table from time to time. This was before...</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The bilateral agreement and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Oh, yes, you'll see why the bilateral agreements were so important to me!
                    So therein ensued about six months of intense hustling and maneuvering and
                    manipulating to try to gain official permission to work as a diplomatic spouse.
                    My husband being the ambassador's assistant, there was no choice but for me to
                    be legal. With the help of a really wonderful executive officer, Vic Dikeos, who
                    was a progressive and forward-looking soul, we started conniving to find a way.
                    As in most cases when people really want something, and in this case Louise
                    Honey really wanted a cracker-jack history teacher and she knew she had found
                    one, she used all of her good offices and means to work the Mexican side of the
                    deal and Vic Dikeos used all of his good offices and means to work the embassy
                    side of the deal and eventually I walked away with the proper and proper
                    consideration (sic).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: It hinged primarily on my leaving the country on my diplomatic passport
                    and coming back on my civilian passport, counting on the fact that Relaciones
                    Exteriores would never check with what Hacienda was doing and vice versa, and
                    they would never know that I was one and the same person. I also had to waive my
                    diplomatic immunity for purposes of transporting myself from and to the school.
                    As long as I was going to work and from work, I could not claim diplomatic
                    immunity. But it was also tacitly agreed with Vic that if anything ever did
                    happen and if anyone ever did ask, I, of course, was coming back from the
                    grocery store.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. You would be protected.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: (laughs) Right. But the fact of the matter is I finally got the papers
                    just in time to start teaching in September in what was my second year in
                    Mexico. I was only able to teach one year because it was a two-year tour, but I
                    had a wonderful experience. At least I was busy and happy and I had wonderful
                    kids. I started the Model UN program there which I have been tickled to death
                    still exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard it exists elsewhere also.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. But it's a big program in the Colegio Americano and the Mexican
                    teacher with whom I worked came to visit me about three months ago and I hadn't
                    seen her in almost twenty years. Again with tales about the program and how it
                    had prospered and what she had done to carry on the work, so that was very
                    satisfying. But having gone through all that rigmarole and all that frustration
                    and, to my mind, foolishness, all of this to earn $5,000 a year as opposed to
                    the $13-15,000 that I would have been earning for the equivalent work in the
                    United States. I came back thinking, “This is really crazy. Either he chooses
                    between his career and me or I have to choose between something for me in my
                    life and him or we have to change the Foreign Service.” Of the three options,
                    the last one seemed preferable! So I took my frustration and fury at the system
                    and marched myself off to Dorothy Stansbury's what was then called “Seminar for
                    Spouses” or the “Class for Spouses” or something like that. And I figured I'd
                    just go hang out there and see if I could meet people that I thought might be
                    interested in the same thing I was interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: This would have been in the summer of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything about the Directive that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well the Directive had come out in '72. I didn't affect me. That's not
                    true, that's not true at all. The fact that it had come out was what made it
                    possible for Vic Dikeos to support my efforts to work in Mexico. Had that
                    directive not come out, he would not have felt at liberty to support my efforts.
                    And so the '72 Directive was very important for me in an indirect kind of way.
                    But not being a member of the Service, being new to it, so I didn't have any
                    sense of the way things used to be, we were still very much in a traditional
                    regime in Mexico. Senior wives - they weren't dragon ladies. To my mind they
                    were doing what was appropriate and what was proper and what was necessary from
                    the standpoint of providing leadership for the younger generation. I mean to
                    tell you, you learned how to do your calling cards, you were given serious
                    protocol, you were told to show up at parties fifteen to twenty minutes in
                    advance. No, you may not talk to Americans and if they caught you spending too
                    much time or sitting down would come over and nudge you and say, “Circulate,
                    circulate.” They were not doing that in a tyrannical or authoritarian way but
                    simply tending to what was at that time understood and properly, and still in my
                    opinion today, is the proper business of good diplomacy, something that I think
                    today we've lost. I don't think we do a very good job. That's another topic. But
                    I was brought up in that context and in that experience in what you could call
                    the last gasp of the old traditional regime. It didn't bother me. People did
                    things properly, they did it well and one took a good deal of pride in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it affected a lot of the ladies then or not?
                        Was it welcome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: That was all anybody knew then. It didn't occur to people to question it
                    particularly. It was good manners. It was good proper behavior as a U.S.
                    representative. It was needed because there was work to be done, there was
                    entertaining to be done. As junior officers we entertained tremendously. We had
                    a large house. I remember one Thanksgiving in particular that I just loved
                    because I had the head of the Communist Student Leadership on my right and I
                    forget who was on my left. But I remember Eduardo particularly, somebody we had
                    met at a cafe and struck up a regular acquaintanceship with and he had become
                    sufficiently impressed with our honesty and our intellectual mettle and we with
                    him that we established an uneasy friendship. We invited him to the house for
                    Thanksgiving and he was absolutely blown away. He had never seen America in that
                    context and in that image and it changed his mind about...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you say “uneasy?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well because he was an ideological Marxist and we were representatives of
                    the great Capitalist Satan to the north, you know. (laughs) He was skeptical
                    about us. Security made it clear that we had to be careful about him. There was
                    terrorism in Mexico at the time. Leonhardy was captured, kidnapped. Our consul
                    general in Guadalajara was kidnapped. A young officer, John Paterson, was
                    kidnapped and killed and, in fact, I substituted for his wife in one of the
                    drops with the FBI and Security boys because Andrea... The kidnapper was running
                    her around from pillar to post saying, “Meet me in X city and have the money and
                    you'll get him back.” And then she would go there and they would say within two
                    hours you have to be in another place. Well there was no way for her to make the
                    drop from where she was in Mexico City. She couldn't get back. So I was asked to
                    substitute for her. And I remember I had terrible fever and flu and the Chief of
                    Security called and said, “Would you come down to the embassy urgently?” They
                    called me out of school. No, I was home sick, that's what it was. Had the flu
                    and they were able to get me at home. And he said, “I hate to do this to you,
                    but will you come down to the embassy urgently. We need to talk to you.” And so
                    I said, “All right” and went into his office and they closed the doors, put on
                    all sorts of equipment and I thought, “My God, what's going on?” And the first
                    thing they said, “Now you are under no obligation to do this. You may walk out,
                    we don't want to put any pressure on you, but the deal was we need somebody to
                    substitute for Andrea. Would you stake out for her with the FBI waiting for the
                    kidnapper?” So it sounded kind of exciting so I said, “Sure, why not?” I went on
                    out with them and we went to a hotel and I waited there. The head kidnapper
                    never came. It was kind of a let-down at this point. (laughs) It was shortly
                    after that that we found out that John had been killed and that was very
                    sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was the incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KINNEY: It went on for the better part of - gosh I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Months, weeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Weeks. But this was under the administration of Luis Echeverria, a
                    leftist, a very decided anti-American and something of a rabble-rouser. It was
                    also in the early '70's when liberation movements and terrorism and all that
                    sort of thing were quite popular and means of advancement particularly in the
                    Third World among “Revolutionary” groups. So Mexico was just one more place on
                    the map where terrorism was a problem and you had to be careful about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever in danger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I didn't feel that I was, no. Street crime was probably a greater
                    difficulty, although we did have one very scary moment in the spring of '72 I
                    guess. Some friends of ours invited us to go on the Descent of the Balsas River
                    - the Decenso de Rio Balsas. We didn't know what this was but it sounded kind of
                    interesting and we loved the outback and we loved pre-Colombian archaeology and
                    we were out all the time. We didn't have children. And they said, “Look, it's
                    down in Guerrero. It's kind of rough to get there. It's like a half an hour of
                    not-so-good road and then another half-an-hour of really pretty bad road. We'll
                    meet you at Estopa and we'll go down together “ This turned out to be an
                    adventure of larger proportions than we had counted on because first of all, we
                    had a flat tire, so we missed the connection at Estopa. So we knew more or less
                    where we were going so we started out intrepidly in our little Town station
                    wagon which fortunately had a heavy-handling package on it because it turned out
                    to be three hours of bad road and three hours of no road at all before we met
                    anybody we knew again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a four-wheel...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: No we didn't have four-wheel. It was just a heavy-handling package,
                    through corn fields, ruts. The car got stuck three times up to its fenders.
                    About three hours, four hours into this journey, and by this time I was
                    practically in tears because we were too far forward. You know we couldn't go
                    back, but we didn't know where we were going. We didn't know if this would ever
                    end.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>About four hours into what turned out to be a six-hour ordeal, we finally
                    stumbled upon a little town out in the middle of nowhere with our diplomatic
                    plates on the car. And I got out and grabbed the first person I could find and I
                    said, “Senor, donde estamos?” Can you tell us where we are? And he looked at me
                    up and down, obviously a gringa. And he looked at the car and he said, “Platas
                    diplomaticas.” Diplomatic plates. And I said, “Yes, we're trying to get to the
                    Rio Balsas to see the Decenso de Rio Balsas boat race. Kayaks down the river.”
                    And I said, “We don't know where we are. We're lost and we're supposed to meet
                    our friends, but it's been a hellacious day already. Can you tell us where we
                    are and how to get to the Rio? Do you know about this event?” And he sort of
                    laughed and he said, “Bueno, senora, donde esta es en el comodore de Luis
                    Cabanas.” Luis Cabanas was the main guerilla leader of southern Mexico at the
                    time and what he told us was, “Well senora, you're in the dining room of Luis
                    Cabanas.”</p>
                <p>Well I went back to the car and reported this duly to Douglas who freaked out and
                    said, “Oh, my God, let's get out of here,” and off we went down the only trail
                    we could find and about two hours later, after almost falling off the side of a
                    mountain because the road was so bad and it was so steep, we finally showed up
                    in our Town Car to huzzahs and shouts of disbelief and congratulations from
                    these other intrepid types, all of whom of course had come with four-wheel
                    drive. And then we proceeded to gleefully try to murder our two friends who had
                    said, “Oh well, it's just a half-an-hour of not so good roads and a half-an-hour
                    of a road that's a little worse.” They didn't have the foggiest notion of what
                    they were talking about.</p>
                <p>Everyone was very impressed that the gringos had come up. This was a Mexican
                    operation, basically, and they were very impressed that the gringos had found
                    their way out from Mexico City and actually shown up and acquitted themselves
                    very well. That was the only time, though, that I think I ever felt endangered.
                    (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I would say. After that long drive and not knowing
                        where you were. And then you came back and you joined the classes with
                        Dorothy Stansbury. Was that sort of the beginning of all these events that
                        lead up to FLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. I went to Dorothy and complained bitterly, cried on her shoulder,
                    said how awful I thought this was. And she said, “Well, there's somebody you
                    ought to meet who might be interested. You might be interested in getting to
                    know her and maybe you all could do something together,” and she directed me to
                    Hope Meyers. And Hope and I met. As I recall we had tea at her house on P Street
                    and commiserated. She was, I think, touched by my fervor and energy and the
                    younger generation coming on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KINNEY: That was in '73, yes. And I don't remember exactly how the working
                    committee on spouses came about, but at a certain point in time... Oh I do
                    remember. In the meantime, I passed my thirty-first birthday, I discovered I was
                    pregnant, came back to Washington, and had to start all over again. My
                    frustration level was, needless to say, high. And I was going through a major
                    transition in addition to the work issue and all of this other just gave fuel to
                    the fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to your exams? The Foreign Service exams
                        that you passed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, yes. Mr. Nixon lifted the freeze two months after my eligibility
                    ran out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nice guy, huh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: So that also added to my frustration. Just everything. That year. I just
                    remember that summer was so awful. I just hated everything. I was furious. “Hell
                    hath no fury” and I was really fit to be tied. I thought, “Well, you can go
                    around being angry, but I've always been somebody who was taught that you have
                    to find something to do about your anger, so.”</p>
                <p>I thought, well, I was pregnant. There was no chance of my getting a job knowing
                    I was going to quit nine months later. I felt obliged to tell them. I remember I
                    interviewed out at Madeira and I blew the interview because I knew I was
                    pregnant at the time and my heart wasn't really in it. So I decided, “Well, I'll
                    do volunteer work.” So I got a job as issues analyst at Common Cause on energy
                    issues and went to Dorothy's class and decided, maybe I would meet some people
                    there who would be helpful to me. And I met Hope [Meyers].</p>
                <p>And then the next thing I knew we were meeting in what became known as the
                    Working Committee on Spouses. There were six of us as I recall. It was Hope and
                    Anna Ralph, Cynthia Chard, myself, Molly Kux and I can't remember the sixth
                    person. I can see her, but I can't remember her name. (Cecile Ledsky?) We would
                    meet every Tuesday in the Department, initially to complain to each other and
                    talk about all the things that we didn't like, and then to start identifying
                    things that we could do to change things. One of the things that we learned from
                    each other was that the so-called “regulation” that required married women to
                    resign never existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was never on paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KINNEY: It never existed. It was just practiced. We got information from the
                    Director General, we talked to people, we learned as much about management as we
                    could. We tried to learn about why people were opposed to these changes
                    involving women that were beginning to take place. We talked about the problems
                    that resulted from taking away the old structure without putting anything in its
                    place.</p>
                <p>Our frustration derived largely from the fact that, although we had been declared
                    “private persons” from the '72 Directive, there was nothing private about our
                    lives at all. Our lives were totally circumscribed by our husbands' professions
                    and their vagabond existence, dragging us from pillar to post with no chance of
                    career continuity, pay or anything else. And so out of that frustration came the
                    sense that, all right, there was one thing worse than being an adjunct to your
                    husband. It was being a non-person. That private persons weren't really private
                    persons at all, they were just non-persons because we didn't exist at all. At
                    least before you existed. You were recognized in OERs. There was a certain
                    responsibility owed to you because, although you weren't paid for your work, it
                    was recognized that you did certain things and therefore the Department in
                    general dealt with you. Now nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were referring to the fact that spouses were evaluated
                        on their husbands' reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: That's correct. On their husbands' report up until 1972. The Research
                    Committee on Spouses became somewhat loosely allied with the Women's Action
                    Organization. The more we did, the more WAO, the Women's Action Organization
                    identified themselves with us and would point to us and say, “Ah, they're part
                    of our group.” I don't ever recall feeling all that close to WAO. Basically my
                    recollection and my feelings at the time were that it was the six of us against
                    the world trying to gather information. It was WAO and our nominal association
                    with WAO that did enable us to get in the building, and that was important, and
                    get the room so we could meet every Tuesday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a conscious decision that you were meeting
                        regularly and at the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. I think Hope was the one who arranged the relationship with WAO. I
                    don't remember. I'm sure she must have. But the thing that I remember most about
                    that experience was this growing sense of empowerment by gathering information
                    and being together, sort of solidarity. Getting increasingly fatter as my baby
                    grew in my tummy. The wonderful sort of irony of being an impending mother
                    starting this little nascent revolution with the six of us.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Organizing a study - it wasn't a study, it was really a questionnaire that
                    Cynthia Chard and I did that to my mind was one of the most seminal acts of the
                    Research Committee on Spouses. It was a very unscientific questionnaire. It was
                    designed for the simple-minded to get simple answers and it was about two pages
                    long with considerable space after each question. It was distributed to as many
                    men as we could get our hands on in the Department who were officers.</p>
                <p>The single most important thing we learned from it was that - One, we got a
                    tremendous response back. As I recall, about 33 percent which is very high for
                    any kind of questionnaire like this. Two, 25 percent of the respondents
                    indicated that the working status of their wife would influence their next
                    assignment. And at that point, I said, “Aha, this is our handle. This is not a
                    women's issue. This is not a malcontent's problem. This is a management
                    concern.” And from that point on, we started attacking the issue as a management
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fact that it affected the husband.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: It affects the Service and so forth. We collated the information, pulled
                    it together, sent it in a small report to Carol Laise who was Director General
                    of the Service at that time. I think we met with her. I don't remember all that
                    clearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hope Meyers indicated that you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. I remember being periodically disappointed and indignant because
                    Carol didn't seem to give us the support that we thought we deserved. But
                    basically we kept at it. In that same time frame, Cynthia Chard also did the
                    first effort at putting together a spouse skills talent bank. One of my memories
                    of that is afternoons over at Cynthia's house addressing thousands and thousands
                    of these forms to send out. She financed it with her own money. Maybe we put in
                    some contributions, I don't know, but that was where that started.</p>
                <p>We did that work in this format for about a year and then I remember Hope coming
                    into one of the meetings and informing us that new leadership was coming on at
                    AAFSW. She asked me in particular to please come. She was a stalwart member of
                    AAFSW which was the old traditional lady's aid society kind of organization for
                    Foreign Service women, although they would not have appreciated that
                    description. That was the way I looked at them. Hope asked me to come to one of
                    the meetings and to explain my concerns. That this new president was coming in
                    and she thought maybe there was a chance of doing something. And I remember her
                    saying, “Stephanie, you must work. You must give the traditional organs a
                    chance. You can't just dismiss them. You can't act as though they don't matter
                    because they do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who the president was at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>KINNEY: I think it was Mary Buell. Lesley Dorman was coming on as the new
                    president, and what I remember about that meeting is that I walked in and it was
                    in a Georgetown home with lovely antique silver. Tea and crumpets crowd to beat
                    the boots. Pearls, real big fat ones all over the place. This was old-style
                    Foreign Service. And what I remember about that meeting is being asked to speak
                    and never in my life having used the conditional, the subjunctive mood as much
                    in my life because I proceeded to suggest to these dear ladies that while as a
                    young spouse I was concerned about x, y and z because this was how I felt about
                    it and perhaps this might indicate that there could be - notice the use of the
                    subjunctive - difficulties and concerns, particularly among the younger women in
                    the Service that might be of interest to AAFSW such that AAFSW might feel
                    inclined to investigate whether or not there was a possibility that there was
                    something they should be doing.</p>
                <p>I am stepping on eggs and being as diplomatic as my poor, bedraggled little mind
                    knows how to do at this point and getting bigger and bigger. So, much to my
                    delight, there was a subsequent lunch, I think at Hope's house, with Lesley
                    Dorman. And Lesley, ever skeptical about young whippersnappers and the
                    obstreperous younger generation was quite tart and quite the disciplinarian to
                    make sure that I understood that I could not just go off popping off and being
                    radical. That I had to give her and everybody else a chance. And that there was
                    a proper way - a “proper” way to do things.</p>
                <p>But that was the beginning of, I think, a warm and affectionate, mutually
                    respectful relationship over the coming years that proved to be a very good
                    synergism and very productive one. Lesley was usually holding onto my coattails
                    and trying to keep my feet on the ground when I would go orbiting off into
                    furious space and I would get frustrated from time to time. But basically we
                    provided a happy balance for one another and accomplished some very fine things
                    together.</p>
                <p>She was very skeptical in those early days and not at all sold, and it used to
                    amuse me tremendously. Or at least that's my recollection because I know when we
                    would talk about it afterwards, that there was never any question but what she
                    was leading the charge all the way. (laughs) But it was very courageous of her.
                    It was an extraordinary departure for the president of AAFSW to engage in this
                    kind of activity because what I proposed to them and what Lesley accepted was
                    the formation of the AAFSW Forum on the Concerns of Foreign Service Spouses and
                    Families. And that was the beginning of the Forum.</p>
                <p>I became the Chairman of the second committee, I think. We were divided up into
                    chapters. What I did essentially was to provide the philosophical and
                    ideological underpinnings for the group and chapter two was The Foreign Service
                    Woman or the New Foreign Service Wife - I don't remember the name of it. But it
                    was the philosophical basis for what we were doing and sort of the concept for
                    the report.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been 1976, wouldn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, let me see. The Forum '73. We moved in AAFSW, must have been the
                    end of '74. Mercier was born in July of '75 and I think we were moving into the
                    Forum by then. The Forum was in '74 because it was published in '75 and a year
                    later to the date - you'll have to check the publication date on it. What I
                    remember is that exactly one year after its publication date, the FLO was opened
                    and inaugurated by Secretary Vance. Was FLO in '77?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: March, '78.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Okay, well then the report must have been published in '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are referring to the Forum Report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes the Forum Report would have been published then in '77 because one of
                    the really miraculous things was that we moved from the publication of the
                    report to the inauguration of the office in one year. So we must have started
                    The Forum in '76. Mercier was born in '75. Yes, that would be about right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little bit more about the Forum
                        Report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: You mean what it consisted of or how we did it? We had meetings at George
                    Mason. I remember the first time we wondered whether anybody was going to show
                    up and we were stunned that there was a roomful of women and they were just all
                    over the place. Vocal and candid. We sent out a very open-ended questionnaire,
                    again Cynthia and I cooked this up, to get the Forum started. The report itself
                    was written in response to letters and phone calls and anecdotal information
                    that we received as a result of another questionnaire. This one was a one-pager
                    and again I remember being over at Cynthia's house until I thought we were going
                    to go crazy. We sent out over a thousand of them overseas this time. The other
                    one had been done in the Department. This was sent exclusively overseas. It was
                    very open-ended. We in essence said, “Tell us what you're worried about. Tell us
                    what's good. Tell us what's bad. Tell us if there are any particular problems
                    that you're facing as a result of being the wife of a Foreign Service
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this directly addressed to the wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KINNEY: It was directly addressed to the wives. You know, Mrs. Harry Barnes, Jr.
                    We had the Stud Book and we had an assignment print-out that we could filch from
                    someplace. And a lot of people had changed, you know. But again, we got a
                    phenomenal response back to these one-page, open-ended questionnaires. People
                    would write seven and eight-page letters.</p>
                <p>There was nothing scientific about it. It could only be described in scientific
                    terms as anecdotal information. But there was a distinct pattern, and as we
                    would read through these things, we would begin. One, we saw and heard echoes of
                    our own experiences and anxieties and anguish and frustration and so forth. We
                    were gratified that there was a lot that was positive in it and we wanted to
                    make sure to emphasize that portion of it. But there were a lot of problems and
                    they began to fall into a pattern.</p>
                <p>And so as we began to read these responses, that's how we formed the basis for
                    the organization of the report based on what we got back. We met with women in
                    Washington. We had these meetings at the George Mason Center and took notes and
                    listened and so forth. We consulted the wives' senior generation. I remember
                    Betty Atherton and Jean Newsom. The really splendid senior wives at the time who
                    had lived the traditional lives of Foreign Service wives, but wanted something
                    better, something different for the younger generation and were very supportive.
                    Many of them had worked in their own way, had been career people, had to give up
                    careers, one thing or another.And then I remember writing sessions. We would
                    write at home and we would bring our drafts to Jean Vance's house. I remember
                    one session there. And I remember being devastated because Janet Kennedy
                    absolutely tore up my first draft. She just marked it up one side and down the
                    other. She's a very good editor. And it came out a better product as a
                    result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom was this report submitted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: The report was submitted to the Secretary of State. It was also submitted
                    to the Director General. The ironic and curious thing where I was concerned was
                    that in 1976, in the midst of all of this, I had taken the exam again in 1975,
                    passed, took the orals, passed, and came in on my own in September of '76. The
                    first year I was in the Service, I still spent more time promoting and helping
                    direct the revolution than I did working as a Foreign Service officer because by
                    this time I was in full swing with Hope and Lesley and a couple of other people,
                    moving this thing along.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>And by this time it really had assumed quasi-revolutionary proportions. We were a
                    force to be dealt with. Everybody knew it. You came anywhere within 50 yards of
                    me, at least, and you were very likely to get the latest report from the front.
                    (laughs) I was expending a tremendous amount of energy on it. This was something
                    I felt very, very deeply about and with a certitude that I look back, and I
                    remember after the FLO was up and everything, looking back on it and thinking,
                    “My God, how did I have the audacity to assert with such certainty these things,
                    because what if it hadn't been that way? What if I hadn't been right?” (laughs)
                    But fortunately, I never questioned it. But the first six months or so in the
                    Foreign Service, I was very involved and I started working it from the inside
                    because now I was inside the Service and I was able to provide the link between
                    the outsiders and the insiders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't suppose it was planned, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well no it wasn't. I had followed the entry into the Foreign Service on a
                    separate track. They offered me the position in September and I figured I'd
                    better take it now or never. I really didn't want to go back to work. Mercier
                    was about 15 months old at the time.</p>
                <p>I came in September of 1976 and I remember I got to know Steve Pzierchinik, a
                    rather well-known psychiatrist. He was Larry Eagleburger's shrink and was
                    working in the Department. He's come in and out since then. He does a lot of
                    terrorism stuff. He's also the author of spy novels and is still in and out of
                    the Department in shadowy ways, but I remember Steve encouraging me to stick to
                    my guns. He, as a psychiatrist had very definite opinions about the affect of
                    all of this on women and spouses.</p>
                <p>In my A-100 class, the representative for the Director General was somebody by
                    the name of Bill Bacchus and he came over and talked to us. And I remember going
                    up to Bill afterward and saying, “You work for the Director General. I have
                    something that I'm very concerned about and if she ever decides to do anything
                    about it, would you please remember me. I would be interested in working on it.”
                    The issue was spouses. That must have been around October or November of
                    '76.</p>
                <p>The great again curiosity is that I was assigned to work in Cultural Affairs for
                    West Africa when CU was still in the Department and that was a wonderful job
                    because it was a nothingburger job and I was able to devote my time to what I
                    considered to be my serious work which was moving the revolution forward.
                    (laughs)</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>But at a certain day, I remember Margaret Sullivan and I were called by Shaw
                    Smith and asked to have lunch over at the Foreign Service Club. And I called
                    Margaret and Margaret called me and we conversed on this and I said, “Margaret,
                    something's off. I don't know quite what it is, but I think this is an important
                    lunch.” We were introduced to Charles Hill, Charlie Hill, who later became the
                    Executive Secretary for the Department with George Shultz. But Charlie was
                    working in Carol's office at the time, the Director General's office at the
                    time, and the two of them sat on this side and Margaret and I sat on this side,
                    and we talked about many things, and at the end of the lunch, I remember
                    Margaret and I walking back to the Department and my saying to her, “I don't
                    know which one, but one of us has just been interviewed for a job.” We were both
                    very excited. It was just splendid. Because we had heard that something was
                    afoot, that we had made enough trouble and caused enough uproar in the
                    Department that now it was going to have to deal with the problem.</p>
                <p>It turned out that I was the one who had been interviewed. Shaw came to me a few
                    days later and indicated that the Director General wanted me to come up and
                    “solve the spouse problem” on which I was known to have just a few opinions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was working with Carol Laise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: This was working with Carol Laise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember you saying earlier that she was not all that
                        excited about the original contacts with the spouse groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that change, and what was your relationship like with
                        her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: My relationship with her was very good, very respectful, very
                    appreciative that One, she was dealing with the issue, and Two, she had given me
                    an opportunity to help address it. Politics mattered and politics had made
                    addressing the issue unavoidable. It was also the right timing, because what
                    Carol really wanted to do was some very serious managerial and organizational
                    reform within the Department of State. And at a certain point in time, she
                    couldn't do that, but what she could do was address the spouse problem, and
                    that's what she did. It was something.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>But there were problems because the position I was supposed to take over belonged
                    to Terry Heale who was an FSO-2 and I was an FSO-7 and the system didn't think
                    that this was appropriate. I learned many things in this job, among them how
                    everything is fungible in the Foreign Service personnel system and probably
                    should be if you really want to get the job done. Shaw left Carol's office
                    before I arrived, and Charlie Hill was my boss, the head of a small unit called
                    Policy Coordination. And enter again Bill Bacchus. Because it was Charlie Hill,
                    Bill Bacchus, Torry Whitman, and Stephanie Kinney. The four of us were Carol's
                    policy people and operatives and formulators for the management reforms that she
                    was trying to undertake.</p>
                <p>For a variety of reasons, we were able to make the most progress in the spouse
                    area. There was the class action suit of women which Torry dealt with. There was
                    reform or changes and modifications of the evaluation system of the Cone System.
                    There were many, many things going on. But my particular brief was spouses and
                    in that connection, I had a unique opportunity because on a certain day, word
                    came down and I was asked to write the Secretary's response to the Forum Report
                    in which, needless to say, I had had a very large hand in formulating and
                    developing the recommendations. So there was no question as to what the
                    Secretary's response was going to be! The question then became, “Well how are we
                    going to get it to the Secretary?” And therein lies another interesting
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to Secretary of State Vance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Vance. Secretary of State Vance. Therein lies another interesting story
                    about the importance of networking and the power of women. Once I went up to the
                    Director General's office, the spouses then had a fox in the chicken house. And
                    I spent most of my time acting as liaison between the external spouse
                    organizations and militants and internal management, translating for one and
                    another, trying to keep confrontation at a minimum, unhappiness at a minimum,
                    and incremental progress forward maximized. Meeting, networking, conversations,
                    cocktails parties, talking to the right person, planting the idea, seeing it
                    come back to you.</p>
                <p>The same thing among the spouses. I would very often see something we were going
                    to need two or three weeks hence and have a conversation with the right spouse
                    leader so that they would come up with the idea about the time we needed it, or
                    they would come forward with whatever action it was. But spending a lot of time
                    suggesting or planting ideas in people's heads as to what we needed to do next,
                    what had to happen next. And part of this was facilitated through something
                    known as the “Lunch Bunch.” When Carter was elected, Jean Newsom, whose husband
                    David was a very old friend of my father-in-law, both of whom...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jean Newsom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KINNEY: She was the wife of the former Under Secretary for Political Affairs,
                    David Newsom. David and my father-in-law, Sheldon Kinney had gone to the War
                    College together and had been in London together in the '50's. When Douglas came
                    into the Foreign Service... Well, David had provided Douglas with information
                    when Doug was a teenager about the Foreign Service and when Doug actually came
                    into the Foreign Service on his own, they were both very thrilled and sort of
                    looked after us as young chicks that they would nurture and take care of.When
                    Carter was elected, Jean called me. She had been interested in what I was doing
                    and she had been supportive of the spouse movement. And she said, “Stephanie, I
                    was wondering if you could come and have lunch with me and some friends” on a
                    certain day. And she had gathered together the senior spouses: Gay Vance and Nan
                    Read, Betty Atherton, Jean - who else was in that group - Barbara Hoganson from
                    the Overseas Briefing Center from the spouse course, Joan Wilson from FSI. Who
                    else was in that group? Those were the people that I remember most, who stand
                    out most to me. I think Hope might have been there, but I'm not sure. I don't
                    remember.</p>
                <p>The basic idea was that the senior wives of the Department, the wives of senior
                    officials, needed a good project and this was going to be it. And so we would
                    meet every Thursday in the Secretary's conference room upstairs and we would
                    bring a bag lunch and we would invite speakers in to learn from the speakers. We
                    would invite people from management in the building in to educate them. Also
                    very decorous, also very purposeful, and always full of good fellowship and
                    friendship among us. I was the youngest one in the group and the only one who
                    was an official of the Department, but again it was serving as this link between
                    the official and the unofficial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was perfect, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: It was wonderful. The best thing, in addition to being able to write the
                    Secretary's response to our recommendations, the other good part of that story
                    was that when the memo was ready, which, of course, recommended the
                    establishment of the FLO and a number of other things, I announced with great
                    glee at the Lunch Bunch the first Thursday after the memo was finished. I guess
                    I'd finished it on a Wednesday, as I recall, and I announced to the Lunch Bunch
                    that the memo was ready and it was ready to go upstairs, but we were expecting
                    problems because it was well-known that the administrative officers, the
                    executive officers both in the Department and at the Cone loathed this idea.
                    They had opposed us all the way. They had no use for spouses, they had no use
                    for families, they thought that this was evil, pernicious stuff. There were one
                    or two enlightened ones, but as a group, the administrative officers of the
                    Foreign Service were not enthusiastic about what we were doing, much less about
                    what we were proposing. A new office that we would control, would have a direct
                    link with management and they would have no say in, but it would make for all
                    sorts of things overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I was worried about the memo getting through SS because I knew it had to have all
                    sorts of clearances. I had to have the clearances from all of the executive
                    directors. And I expected them to hold it up. Which in effect, began to happen.
                    And they said, “When is Cy going to get it?” Cy Vance, the Secretary. And I
                    said, “Well, Gay, I don't know. We're having some trouble with clearances from
                    the executive directors, but it'll get there eventually.” And she said,
                    “Stephanie, you do have an extra copy of it, don't you?” (laughter) And I said,
                    “Well, I suppose that could be arranged.” And she said, “Well, you know, I think
                    Cy would be very interested in reading this tonight.” So I got her an extra copy
                    of it and she took it home and tucked it under his pillow. And within 24 hours,
                    we had the Secretary's blessing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful. This is the blessing for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: For FLO. So therein ensued about a year's worth of work of how you
                    actually implement what we had proposed, and I was intimately involved in that.
                    We had a very open and highly publicized talent search for the first
                    coordinator. Janet Lloyd was chosen. And then once Janet was chosen, I sort of
                    took her under my wings and started introducing her and tutoring her in the
                    wiles and ways of the Department. And we would have wonderful times roaming the
                    building and plotting and conniving to get what we needed for this, that or the
                    other. She was more than a quick study and an apt student. She was very talented
                    in her own right and as soon as she got her feet on the ground and got sort of
                    oriented to things, she took off on her own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: She was a counselor in high school counseling. She was a Foreign Service
                    wife of years and years. She had worked on school boards. She was a very
                    traditional wife. She had four children. She and Wingate left the Service some
                    years ago now, but Wingate was still in the Service when she became the first
                    head of FLO. And she was wonderful. We couldn't have had a better person. I just
                    remember such marvelous, giggly, fun times with her, sort of introducing her to
                    how to get things done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she hadn't been that involved prior to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: She hadn't been that involved prior to that. She had little if any
                    knowledge of the Department as a bureaucracy. This was really the shift, and
                    with some difficult moments because it was hard for the spouses to turn it over
                    to the Department from the unofficial to the official, just as it was very hard
                    for me a year or so later to let go of it and go on my way in my own career in
                    other areas of the Department and other worries and concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Because projects like this are really like having babies. There's a gestation
                    period, there's intense labor, pain, anxiety and effort to produce it. Then
                    there's nurturing it to get it off the ground and actually make it happen. Then,
                    like children, you have to let go and it either succeeds or fails on its merits.
                    Either you were right and you've designed it well and you've prepared it well
                    and laid a good foundation and it thrives, or you didn't and it won't survive.
                    So one of my great satisfactions has been the fact that I was very involved in
                    it from the concept to the implementation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That ought to give you some great satisfaction then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: And that it survived on its own merits. We were right. It was needed,
                    there was a role for it, it was well-designed to help people help themselves,
                    not do it for them, but to help them help themselves on one hand, and to be a
                    management tool and research and mechanism on the other. To have direct links to
                    management, to get families recognized as significant elements of this business.
                    To exact and exhibit a certain social responsibility to those people whose lives
                    are circumscribed and affected by this business. And in turn, to reap the
                    benefit of the freeing of their talents and the enrichment that that ultimately
                    puts back into the system if you nurture it and encourage it to grow, as opposed
                    to ignoring it and watching it wither.</p>
                <p>I remember (laughs) swearing to the Secretary on a stack of Bibles that if he
                    would just let me have that little space right down there as you come in. It was
                    a cloak room. It had a window that lifted up like this. It was a coat check
                    place. I remember promising them, “We just need three officers and just that
                    tiny little space. You just turn that coat check place into an office and that's
                    all we'll need and we promise we won't ask for anything more.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they gave it to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: They gave it to us. And within seven months, I think we had requests for
                    new people. You know, the empire was expanding. I don't know how many people are
                    hired down there today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you how many people were hired
                        initially with Janet.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Initially? Janet, a secretary, a deputy. Three people. When we were doing
                    the design, one of the fun things was that I had a network of folk overseas.
                    Marilyn Holmes was very important, Molly Whitehouse was very important. People
                    who were overseas who were watching this with great interest. Again, senior
                    wives who were sympathetic who were just waiting for the FLO to be established
                    so that they could come in and request overseas branches. And Marilyn and Molly
                    were two of the first people. I remember Molly was in Bangkok and Marilyn was in
                    Portugal, I think.</p>
                <p>As soon as the FLO was up and running and had been inaugurated by the Secretary,
                    about three months later, we started getting these requests from overseas to
                    establish overseas branches and that was the beginning of the CLO program. And
                    with much discussion over whether you kept the name FLO or CLO. It was felt that
                    overseas, it needed to be “community.” But one of the political factors on which
                    the establishment had turned... I must say that when Carter was elected in '76,
                    from that time on I never doubted that there was going to be this office,
                    because my political sense...</p>
                <p>One of the reasons that I was so intense about it was that Carter had a big
                    family theme and I just knew it was the right issue, the right time, and we were
                    going to do it the right way. It was a win/win situation. It was a way of their
                    implementing their agenda and their plan. It just never crossed my mind from
                    that point on that this wasn't going to happen. But having put all that emphasis
                    on family...</p>
                <p>I remember Janet Eagen was the person who thought up the name. We were over at
                    Jean Vance's house one afternoon and were playing around with acronyms and
                    titles and everything. And Eagen was the one who came up with “FLO” and she
                    said,”Family Liaison Office, FLO. Like it makes things flow and it's like Flo,
                    my old friend that I can tell anything to. My buddy, the person whose shoulder I
                    can I always cry on. Good old Flo will always take care of me. You know, Flo the
                    beautifician, Flo my friend, Flo the secretary or whatever.” And we all said,
                    “Absolutely right. That's it.” And so it never changed from that afternoon. But
                    the concept of family, the word “family” was crucial to the political selling of
                    it, because it was a political idea as well as a necessity and a management
                    resource. And we had sold it as “family” up on the Hill as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you about that. Tell me a little bit
                        about that. Marching up to the Hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, gosh, I don't really remember. I remember I testified. I had never
                    testified in front of Congress before. I just remember being awed. I'd done a
                    lot of public speaking. It doesn't bother me. I love getting up and moving
                    people. But I remember walking into that hearing room and looking up and there's
                    something about those Senators behind that hard-wood dais sitting up there
                    peering down at you with their little plaques in front of them and you're at the
                    table. And you're sworn to “tell the truth, the whole truth.” And all of the
                    sudden my knees felt like they were going to give out from under me. And I got
                    cotton mouth and my stomach started churning. The worst stage of stage fright. I
                    don't normally have nerves like that.</p>
                <p>But I just suddenly realized I had been in the Service probably less than a year
                    and this was pretty heady stuff. I mean you don't normally testify before
                    Congress unless you're at least a Deputy Assistant Secretary. (laughs) I had
                    written my testimony and I remember thinking, “Oh my God, thank heavens I've
                    written it because I just couldn't bear to do this extemporaneously.” I normally
                    speak extemporaneously. I don't usually talk from notes. I can't remember
                    whether I read it or not. I think I probably didn't because you usually have to
                    give this sort of precis. And then they asked me some questions.</p>
                <p>And I remember there was one question that kind of threw me because I thought it
                    was kind of antagonistic and it was supposed to be all friendly. I had to
                    respond back. I don't remember what the question was, I just remember thinking,
                    “Ooooh, I hope I don't say the wrong thing!” I was trying to be so diplomatic
                    and so cool. But the hearing went well. It was basically a softball because as
                    most good hearings go, this was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pro forma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, not pro forma, but you should know in advance what the outcome is
                    going to be. And in this case, the hearing was arranged so that we would be on
                    the record, so that there would be a legislative and statutory basis for the
                    office so that nobody else... Because our main concern still were the
                    administrative officers in the Service. The Secretary had mandated this thing
                    from the top down. This was regarded as an outrageous coup on the part of the
                    spouses. And there were many people who were very irritated and resentful of it.
                    And the concern was that as soon as Secretary Vance goes, that somebody might do
                    it in.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>And there was also the issue that was beginning to brew and that we were
                    beginning to work on of compensation for Foreign Service spouses through the
                    annuities. Spouses who were divorced lost any entitlement to the annuity and
                    that was really unfair because here they had served all this time overseas, and
                    these men would run off with these young chickies at a certain age, and the
                    Foreign Service wife, who had served all the years overseas, wouldn't get a
                    penny of the annuity and the young chickie would get the whole thing even if
                    she'd never turned her hand or done the first thing or suffered the first
                    sacrifice. So people were pretty steamed about that.</p>
                <p>We worked with Pat Schroeder and a number of people on the Hill. Ginny, what was
                    Ginny's name? She was Fossel's staffer. But that started a period of very
                    intense and effective lobbying at the staff level particularly and it became
                    very regular for five or six years after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else went with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I don't remember. I really don't. I think I went as the spokesperson from
                    the DG's office. But I really don't remember. I remember the emotions attached
                    to it and I remember being very glad that it was over. Because I was surprised.
                    I didn't expect to be affected like that. That has always stayed with me. How
                    the power, how the weight, the seriousness of institution, of the Constitution
                    bears down on you when you are called to testify before Congress. It's a very
                    interesting dynamic.</p>
                <p>Many people testified after that. The spouses became very, very effective in
                    organizing their Congressional networking and they were successful in getting
                    language and in getting laws changed. The annuity problem was finally addressed,
                    to my mind, equitably. I think in large part because of this tremendously
                    empowering experience that coming together, organizing, documenting the problem,
                    pursuing the political and the social goals in a responsible way, and then
                    implementing the commitments demonstrated that spouses could exert some control
                    over their destiny. The Department was capable of change, institutions matter,
                    and we had taken an institutional, not a personal approach to it and made a
                    difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back to a couple of points. One was AAFSW's
                        stance on the spouse issues at the beginning. Why was there so much
                        resistance from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Resistance? In general terms, it was a generational thing. Women who had
                    dedicated their entire life to being Mrs. Foreign Service officer, whose
                    identity was founded on being Mrs. Foreign Service officer, were very hurt and
                    outraged that, in essence, what they were being told was, “You were wrong. You
                    were stupid. You're a damn fool.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being told by young wives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: No, no, they weren't being told by young wives. Implicitly what the 1972
                    Directive did to the older women was say, “You were wrong. You were foolish. You
                    don't matter. Your contribution doesn't matter.” So it was a double-edged sword.
                    And it's not fair to draw this strictly along generational lines because there
                    were older generational women who, as I mentioned - Jean Newsom and Betty
                    Atherton and Marilyn Holmes and I could list them forever - were very
                    supportive, were very forward-looking, were very encouraging to the younger
                    generation.</p>
                <p>But on the whole, it was the younger generation wives who were bitching, moaning,
                    complaining, criticizing, taking them to court, etc., saying, “This is not
                    right.” And in general it was the older wives who had lived their lives in the
                    traditional fashion, who had done everything they were supposed to.</p>
                <p>Take for example the wife who had spent fifteen or sixteen years in the Service
                    working her way up and was about to be Mrs. Queen Bee, Mrs. DCM or Mrs.
                    Ambassador, and suddenly was told she had no place anymore. She had no
                    authority, she had no respect, she had no status, and mostly she had no help to
                    get the work done so she ended up doing it all herself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is something that she had been doing for years for
                        other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Exactly. So I never faulted, and I don't think anyone should ever fault,
                    those who resisted, those who felt uncomfortable, those who were skeptical. The
                    psychological dimensions of this problem deserve consideration and generosity
                    and we tried, or at least I certainly tried to be very conscious of that and
                    sensitive to it. But the mere fact that you were asking for something else, the
                    mere fact that you were asserting the proposition that something else had to be
                    done was an implicit criticism of the way many other people had dedicated their
                    lives. That's very hard. Change is not easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. This was also a time when more and more younger wives
                        had careers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well one of the things that we pointed out in the report... A lot of this
                    had been couched in terms of women's lib or the Feminist Movement. The
                    association with WAO certainly gave it that cast and it was one of the reasons
                    I, at least, wanted to move it to AAFSW and I was very glad for the opportunity
                    to do that because feminism in the Department of State had a bad name. It was
                    associated with Alison Palmer and Class Action Suits and general cantankerous
                    rabble-rousing. That made it harder to get things done because that particular
                    style evoked opposition in what was a very male-dominated, basically macho
                    institution.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So what we did was play the old sweet Southern thing. I mean, I'm a
                    fifth-generation Floridian, bred and born and when I came into the Foreign
                    Service, in my autobiography I had to say why I was qualified to be a diplomat.
                    I said that I had been born and raised a Southern women and I knew there was
                    more than one way to skin a cat. (laughter) Well what we did was use female
                    networking - shamelessly played on our male counterparts to mentor and ram
                    through for the better good of womankind, dramatic institutional change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad you did that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: And there were those who, for feminist purity and ideological reasons,
                    might have found all of that reprehensible, but frankly I was more interested in
                    getting something accomplished, not the ideology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. The other point I was thinking was why was
                        there resistance in the Director General's office when they first brought
                        the reports of meetings to Carol Laise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: You mean from the Research Committee on Spouses?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I'm not sure that we appreciated adequately the imperatives of
                    bureaucratic process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is why I asked you because you've been on the other
                        side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. And I'm not sure that Carol initially appreciated how real the
                    problem was and how determined we were. What was being proposed was pretty
                    radical and she had already made one very radical move, the '72 Directive,
                    implementing it. I don't think she actually did. I think the DG before her was
                    the one who did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: But she was charged with implementing it. And you'll recall the '70's
                    were a very socially turbulent time. You had all of the angst and dissent and
                    division over Vietnam. You had feminism on the rise, a very vocal and strident
                    variety. You had concerns with Civil Rights and the rights of minorities.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>And Carol, in a very traditional... I mean, the Foreign Service diplomacy, they
                    say, is the world's second oldest profession, you know. She was responsible for
                    managing a venerable institution which was in some ways not adequately prepared
                    and suited to social revolution and the changes that were happening in American
                    society. Institutions change slowly. If the change is sound, a certain
                    deliberate speed is necessary. I mean a certain slowness, a certain considered
                    speed is necessary, because if it's too much and too fast, it's not going to
                    produce a good result. So I think, looking back on it, Carol probably had to be
                    convinced that One, we knew what we wanted.</p>
                <p>I mean in the Research Committee on Spouses, we had a general complaint but we
                    didn't have a proposal for a concrete action and a plan. It was sort of “Do
                    something!” And a policy-maker can't deal with that. A policy-maker can deal
                    with concrete recommendations A, B, C, and D. That you take a decision on. “Do
                    something, I'm unhappy” isn't something that you can really deal with. So it was
                    extremely important. I think we sensed intuitively the importance of evidence,
                    the importance of documenting the problem first and that was how we started out.
                    And that's what the research committee basically did. We sought to document the
                    problem and then we documented it further with the Forum Report.</p>
                <p>But having documented the problem, documenting helped lead us to how you solve
                    it. What the recommendations are. And then when you have concrete
                    recommendations, that's something that a policy-maker can deal with because you
                    can look at it in terms of what the impact is going to be on the institution,
                    what the legal ramifications are, what the political ramifications are. Part of
                    the problem is, “What happens if I don't respond?” It's as big a problem as,
                    “What happens if I do respond?” So I would say that in fairness to Carol, her
                    position evolved and she took action commensurate with the state of the debate.
                    When it was inchoate, poorly defined and devoid of specific proposals, she
                    rightfully...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rejected it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Not that she rejected it, but she simply was not enthusiastic. I mean she
                    never told us, “You're wrong.” But we just wanted her to say, “You're right and
                    I'll solve the problem for you tomorrow.” Well that's not the way it works.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was some question about how the report conformed
                        to the State Department format perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>KINNEY: No I don't think that was the specific issue. I would say that initially,
                    our perception, and I suppose if we had the good fortune to talk to Carol, God
                    rest her soul, today, her memories of us might be very different. She might have
                    looked at us as disorganized, not knowing what we wanted, whiners. I mean one
                    doesn't know. But the issue was young. The issue was still insufficiently
                    formed. The changes between 1974 and 1977 were dramatic in terms of the number
                    of women involved, the degree of organization of those women, the definition of
                    the problem, the supporting evidence, and concrete recommendations. We had all
                    that together. We were a force to be dealt with. The timing was right. And Carol
                    hired me and said, “Solve it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the group of four at the DG's office, were you the
                        only spouse or former spouse? There were four of you at the policy
                        coordination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you must have made a tremendous difference there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, I thought I did. There were very few women. I remember while I was
                    up there, I got commissioned the first study of tandems. My recollection is
                    probably a little imprecise, but I think I recall that when the first count was
                    done, there were thirty-four tandem officer couples, and most of those were
                    couples in which the wife had left the Service and had come back recently.
                    Because when they promulgated the '72 declaration and rescinded the non-existent
                    rule on married women, a good number of women came back into the Service. They
                    had been being Foreign Service wives in the intervening years, accompanying
                    their husbands overseas, etc., etc. And they were able to come back and work and
                    be their own officer, they took the opportunity. There were relatively few of
                    us, in fact there was practically nobody I felt I could turn to who was my age,
                    my stage in life, you know, young, small child, and married, and also an
                    officer.</p>
                <p>I remember when we went to Rome looking around, it was a huge embassy. It was
                    about 600 people. The country team was about 35 people and I remember being as
                    lonely as I had ever been in my life because I left the DG's office and went to
                    Rome, and when I left the DG's office, when I left Washington, I left all of my
                    women friends, all of my women support group. And I was utterly alone and there
                    was no one like me. I know how a minority feels when he or she goes into a room
                    and doesn't see him or herself in the group because I went into Rome and I was a
                    freak. There were women who had small children, but they weren't officers. There
                    were officers who were women, but they weren't married or they didn't have
                    children. There was no one that I could look at and see myself in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the first time you went overseas as a
                        tandem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. And candidly and openly share souls, experience, and exchange notes
                    on how you survive. So I basically had to figure it out on my own and it was
                    hard. It was very, very lonely, very, very conflicted because it's bad enough to
                    have the childcare situation such as it is in Washington, but then to take your
                    sweet little rosebud at age 3 � or 4 and transport her overseas and fall into
                    the hands of foreigners and long bus rides to the school and the chaotic city
                    that Rome was and everything. There were many wonderful moments and we all had
                    ultimately pretty happy memories of that time, but the conflict and the
                    loneliness of that first year, added to the fact that we didn't have a house to
                    live in, was as miserable as I ever remember being in the Service.</p>

                <p>KINNEY: Oh, yes, because I didn't have a wife. I very badly needed a wife to run
                    the house, take care of the child, worry about the schooling, and make life easy
                    for me. And the fact that we worked with a rather demanding officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I worked the first year as an assistant science attach� and the second
                    year I did six months on the visa line and six months as an information officer
                    in USIA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your husband?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: He was the ambassador's executive assistant. He had been brought to Rome
                    to “stop the firings.” It was a challenging assignment.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. And Open Forum. Did he do one year of UNP? I think he might have
                    done one year of UNP in order to get things in sync. God, my memory is failing
                    me these days. This is awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pretty happy to at least get that assignment
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Oh, no, it was an incredible, I mean... We were minding our own business.
                    We didn't ask for the assignment. It came to us. Richard Gardner was the
                    ambassador in Rome and the embassy was not a happy place. People kept getting
                    fired. And once again, he needed an executive assistant and so he asked three
                    people whom he should seek for the job. They happened to be David Newsom, Alan
                    Holmes, I forget who the third one was, and they all said, “Doug Kinney.” And so
                    we got a telephone call saying, “How would you like to go to Rome?” And we said,
                    “My God, are you kidding? Fantastic.” We were thrilled at the assignment.</p>
                <p>Little did we appreciate or understand at the time how challenging it would be. A
                    very demanding and challenging ambassador to work for. A city which is one of my
                    favorite places on earth, but the only Middle Eastern city without a European
                    quarter. Rome has its own very special- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Kinney, we were talking earlier on about the skills
                        bank that I think was Cynthia Chard's idea. That certainly was sort of the
                        beginning of FLO and I would like you to tell me a little bit more about
                        that. How that worked. Was Cynthia ever compensated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Cynthia was compensated. As I recall, we paid her $4,000 finally after
                    much agony. But the project at that point in time was a good example of the
                    conflict that an officer can face vis-a-vis making responsible decisions that
                    involve friends. One might look perhaps a bit more sympathetically on Carol
                    Laise as a trailblazer, as a woman, perhaps she was sympathetic to what the
                    women were saying - I don't know - early on. But I suspect as an official, as a
                    bureaucratic decision-maker and policy-maker, she had to draw certain rather
                    hard decisions and assessments about how far advanced, how well-developed the
                    debate was at a given point.</p>
                <p>I think the skills bank presented me with a similar problem. I don't really
                    remember the origins of that. I know that Cynthia and I both came together on
                    the Research Committee on Spouses very early. I know that both of us were very
                    enthusiastic about the concept of the skills bank. I do know that Cynthia could
                    claim motherhood to it in that she was the one who actually did the work. She
                    was not working at the time and she had the time to develop forms and write
                    letters and that was a connection with WAO. She is the WAO connection for this
                    project.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>It presented me with difficulties after I went up into the DG's office, because
                    on one hand here was a woman with whom I had been good friends, with whom I had
                    worked closely, but in whom I frankly and honestly did not have a great deal of
                    confidence at the time that she would be able to do everything she claimed. Not
                    because she was mis-representing or not because she wasn't capable, but because
                    it was my honest, personal assessment, which I did not share with anybody, and I
                    kept very quiet about, that the concept, the product wasn't ready for prime
                    time. The timing wasn't right. Notwithstanding all of the angst, notwithstanding
                    all of the demand and the whining and crying that was out there, it was very
                    clear to me that we did not have a critical mass yet to actually make the skills
                    bank work. You could put a tremendous amount of money into fixing up a very
                    expensive computerized data bank and you wouldn't have anything in it. Because
                    most of the women were still not in the working mode in 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you would have liked to see perhaps the office of FLO
                        get started first and implement these things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Absolutely. And Cynthia created the skills bank and pushed the skills
                    bank. It was her thing and she was very single-minded about it. There was no
                    question in my mind that if I had to choose between the two, the skills bank was
                    not viable in 1976. It didn't really become viable for another ten years. I
                    don't know how well it's working today. My sense is that it has a reasonable
                    product today, but my assessment in 1976 is that for all the idealism, for all
                    the energy that I had put in to help, that the idea made sense to me as
                    something that one wanted to work for, that the timing was not yet right.</p>
                <p>If you paid ten, fifteen, twenty thousand dollars, whatever it was Cynthia was
                    asking for it, or was proposing be spent, we were going to have a project that
                    would not have a successful outcome. Above all, success, I believe, was an
                    essential ingredient of future success. In other words, if we demonstrated that
                    we made bad decisions or we had poor judgement with regard to product and
                    timing, then we would never be trusted again. I remember agonizing over this,
                    feeling terribly uncomfortable, avoiding her phone calls. Never coming out. I
                    never wanted to hurt her feelings, I never wanted to say anything against her; I
                    felt like a traitor.</p>
                <p>The fact of the matter was I could not recommend to anyone in good conscious and
                    good faith in the DG's office that we should spend $20,000 on this at that point
                    in time. And as I recall, when push came to shove, mostly to get rid of her
                    because it went nowhere, but for her past time, I did manage to get $4,000 for
                    her. I felt like that was fair. It wasn't what Cynthia expected. It wasn't how
                    she valued it. But I felt that at least I had gotten her some recognition. We
                    had paid her something for her efforts. And it really fell to Susan McClintock a
                    couple of years later to start putting the thing together in a way that could be
                    integrated with the systems and the process in the Department itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your feelings shared by other people or were there
                        other people who supported Cynthia's idea more and tried to push that
                        forward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Speaking from the official side of the ledger, from the bureaucratic side
                    of the ledger, this was not a project that inspired confidence in anybody, so I
                    was the only person who was even charitable. And I did feel obliged to ensure
                    that she got some recompense for her efforts to be kind. There was no tolerance
                    for it within the bureaucracy at all. That changed in coming years as it grew
                    out of the FLO and it became more integral to what was going on.</p>
                <p>I don't recall among the spouses themselves - I know Lesley was always very kind
                    and very supportive of it, but the grandiose images of it were never matched by
                    reality and by actuality, and I think most people felt a little uneasy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe a little bit of your understanding of
                        what Cynthia Chard was thinking? What that skills bank would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well the idea was very simple and all you have to do... I don't know
                    whether any of the original forms still exist or not. It was one page and we did
                    it up over at her house and she got them printed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still one page!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: It's still one page. Basically the assumption was that there were lots of
                    women who were highly skilled and that those skills, if made known to business,
                    would be a resource for business to draw on, whether that business was
                    government business in an embassy, in a consulate, in the Department itself, or
                    whether that was private business. And so all you had to do, she said simply and
                    naively, was record who the women were and what they could do and make it
                    available to anybody who might hire someone and the two would come together.
                    Easier said than done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Advertising or getting people who needed to hire - how shall I say this?
                    The fundamental issue was one of market development. You had to provide a
                    service of reliable, accurate, centralized consistent information to over time
                    build a market of employers who would come to this source of information to seek
                    employees. That's a big proposition when you're talking world-wide. Because what
                    it amounts to is one job here, two jobs there, three jobs over there all the way
                    around the world. Maybe a half a dozen or so in the Department. And how much
                    does it cost?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put all that information on the computer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: To build that system and so forth and so on. How many jobs are you
                    actually going to get out of it? In 1976, my feeling was in my honest heart of
                    hearts that the cost-benefit wasn't there, as much as I wanted to support it, as
                    much as I liked the idea, as much as I had been a party to saying, “Hey, this is
                    what we need to do.” Thinking of my own future, basically, at that point. I
                    wanted to make getting a job easier for me and the skills bank seemed a logical
                    way to do it. But when you looked at the costs involved and the small benefits
                    initially, because of the timing - you know everything is in the timing - in
                    1976, I couldn't personally in my heart of hearts justify it. I think it's more
                    justifiable today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was the issue that there wasn't a place to house
                        the skills bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well no, once we had FLO, there was no problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But prior to that, that was an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: There was something of a contest. As I said I put all of my money on FLO
                    and there was never a question in my mind as to what the priority was and how
                    you had to start. You had to have a significant bureaucratic entity integrated
                    into the personnel management of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which FLO is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Which FLO is, to deal with these issues. Once you had that, then it could
                    grow in any number of ways and you have educational counseling, you have
                    self-help information, you had evacuation specialists, you have work and skills
                    bank functions, a variety of things that are needed by families. Aged parents,
                    counseling and advice on how you deal with that problem now is something that is
                    coming on that was not a major issue before. Single-parent households.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The Foreign Service had an abnormal number of divorces, not of bad marriages, but
                    an abnormal number of divorces relative to the American population in the early
                    '70's. We've now caught up and probably surpassed the national norm, but in
                    those days, while divorce was becoming more common and more acceptable in the
                    society at large, within the Foreign Service it was still something of a taboo.
                    It demonstrated you couldn't manage your affairs, and if you couldn't manage
                    your affairs, how could you be a good officer? If you're not a good officer, you
                    won't get promoted, and if you don't get promoted, end of career.</p>
                <p>So there was a lot of unhappiness, there were a lot of bad marriages, there were
                    a lot of women in what I consider to be deplorable and unbearable circumstances.
                    But they were tough. They were disciplined. They didn't question. If they
                    questioned, they kept it to themselves. You know, stiff upper lip and all that.
                    Sometimes they drank themselves under the table, but you know that happens
                    today, too. It's no big deal. We're just a little bit more open about it and we
                    have programs.</p>
                <p>One of the things that came out of that period of time when I was in the DG's
                    office that Betty Atherton was very involved in and I enjoyed working with her -
                    magnificent woman - was the mental health programs. And, again, those programs
                    and those support systems got a tremendous boost from that particular time and I
                    used every bit of influence that I could to push that from a management
                    standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't realize that the Director General's office had
                        such influence on that program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: The Office of Medical Services is under Management. It's not under
                    Personnel except Personnel hires the shrinks who are the regional psychiatrists,
                    etc. It's all part of a piece and we certainly used DGP in those days to push
                    that. In fact it's really funny that you should mention it because I was for
                    some reason looking at my old efficiency reports from those days and was
                    reminded of that, the work that we had done, very prominently highlighted the
                    last year I was there. Some workshops and seminars and working with Pat Hayes
                    and others to try to start getting profiles on Foreign Service officers and
                    families. And trying to ascertain whether this population, one, had a particular

                    example.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The spate of evacuations that occurred in '79, for example. We had recommended -
                    I think it was the eighth recommendation - maybe eighth or tenth, I don't
                    remember. One of the last recommendations of the ten that was on the Forum
                    Report had to do with evacuations and specialists and so forth. Here again, my
                    role, I'd ignored it completely. I never mentioned a word about it. Nothing was
                    done in '76. When I did the memo to the Secretary, I said, “Forget about it. You
                    don't have to do that. Just do this.” Because I knew I couldn't get all ten. So
                    you have to make some decisions. What do you start with? Well you start with the
                    office because again, in 1976, there was no apparent need. I mean there were
                    general complaints and so forth, but there wasn't a crisis.</p>
                <p>By '79, you had an evacuation crisis because you had Pakistan, you had Iran. I
                    forget how many others. There were four or five all at one time. Sudan, maybe? I
                    don't remember where they were. It was a clutch of evacuations that just
                    produced paralysis and chaos because they had so many people coming back from
                    overseas. Pets, dogs, children, everybody disoriented, no services and all the
                    rest. And suddenly everything that we had recommended in '76 was seen to be true
                    in spades. And so then those recommendations were acted on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I may, I'd like to go back to Carol Laise one more time
                        because she had an interesting background, and perhaps having worked with
                        her, you can comment on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: The significant thing about Carol was that she was a self-made woman. She
                    started out as a secretary and she made it to ambassador in the Foreign Service,
                    one of the few women ambassadors at that time. She ultimately ended up marrying
                    Ellsworth Bunker, one the great statesmen of this country. They had a commuting
                    marriage. She was in Nepal and was he in India - I don't remember exactly. India
                    or China, I can't remember exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had been in India in the beginning of the '60's, the
                        late '60's, but I don't know where.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: But she was ambassador to Nepal as I recall. And Bunker was ambassador
                    either to China - oh, he was ambassador to Vietnam! So they were really a
                    startling couple at that particular period in history. She married very late.
                    She never had children. I always felt very sympathetic to her because, as
                    disappointed as we were at her lack of enthusiasm and apparent empathy for our
                    problems, she was one of the women who had had to give up everything in order to
                    have a Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>Back to my introduction to the Foreign Service as a 16-year old. You could not
                    have both. You had to choose. And she chose the career. It was a difficult
                    career for a woman. There was no social underpinning and sympathy for it. She
                    could not get married in the terms of her time and did not and was solely and
                    exclusively dedicated to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>One of the things that I remember most about Carol and that has stayed with me
                    most, and I find myself interestingly enough in the last year or so repeating to
                    younger officers who I think need reminding of this. It was Carol who said to me
                    when I was furious one day and ranting and raving about all the things I thought
                    the Service should do for me who said, “But Stephanie, the Service is not here
                    to serve you. The point of this career is service to the U.S. Government and its
                    citizens. Your concerns are secondary and will always and should always be
                    thus.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: So she had as strong a service ethos, something that I think has been
                    significantly and unfortunately diluted, damaged, diminished today. But she felt
                    that dedication, she believed that the first obligation was to serve, and
                    anything personal came second.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did she make the transition from Foreign Service
                        secretary into the Foreign Service officer? They were separate, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Damned hard work. Talent and perseverence. At a certain point in time in
                    her career, there was an opportunity to shift systems and she simply lifted the
                    opportunity. Things had opened up enough that she could work as a mid-level
                    officer and she was talented, she worked hard. In her later years, she benefited
                    from the feminist movement because when they were looking around for token women
                    - there weren't very many - Carol was there and she exploited every opportunity
                    as the political overlords exploited her.</p>
                <p>I don't want to ascribe anything negative to either side. It was simply the right
                    time in history. She had the skills, she had the background, she had the ability
                    and she was a woman when they needed women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many of those women were there, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Very few. I mean we still don't have more than 1 or 2 percent in the
                    senior ranks of the Foreign Service. And I don't believe that's because the
                    Foreign Service is inherently evil, sexist, and discriminatory, I think it's
                    because most women are not willing to make the sacrifice that Carol made. Most
                    women are not prepared to be single-minded about it. Now that's not to say that
                    you have to be single-minded today. There are women at the top, ambassadors who
                    are mothers, wives, etc. But the career is a very hard one. It is hard enough to
                    be a working mother in Washington, DC. It is four times as hard when you
                    transport it overseas, have to move in and deal with a foreign culture and your
                    children the same.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>There are more models now certainly, and I think that makes it easier. The
                    younger generation I think, I hope is a little less conflicted than my
                    generation was, too. Such anguish, such pain, such “Oh my God, what am I doing?
                    Am I doing the right thing? Am I doing the wrong thing?” Just some days having
                    to close your eyes and say, “I have faith. This will all work out. I am not
                    damaging either my family, my daughter or myself. We are just very challenged.”
                    And hope and pray that something terrible doesn't happen as a result of the
                    decisions you've made.</p>
                <p>But having no support anywhere you turned to say, “You're doing okay. Don't
                    worry, it's all right.” At least today, a lot of the young mothers may still
                    have a very tough time. They may still feel very conflicted, but there are
                    sources of affirmation, there are sources that confirm them, all around them.
                    Whether it's the media or the television or other officers in the embassy or
                    just American society. But it's still tough because learning foreign languages,
                    learning foreign ways.</p>
                <p>I think the hardest thing for me about the Foreign Service is what I call, “Going
                    back to kindergarten.” That every three years, just as you achieve a certain
                    level of competency and accomplishment and recognition for that, you are
                    stripped of it and you have to start back at square one, proving to everybody
                    that you're worth it. And this doesn't change. It's the part that I just
                    hate.</p>
                <p>There are two parts I hate that are psychologically wrenching. One is that and
                    the other is having to leave good friends, relationships that you have worked
                    very hard developing and opening up, and then from day to night, that's the end
                    of them. Some people are better at writing letters. I don't seem to be very good
                    at carrying on long-distance relationships and so I've developed a certain
                    hardness about learning to be open and to love, if you will, to give, to share
                    while it's there, but moving on when it's over, because I just can't deal with
                    the... If I thought about it, I'd sit down and cry.</p>
                <p>And then coming back to Washington, you know you're not coming home. This place
                    is just as strange as going to East Wa-Wa when you come back because the
                    friendships, the networks, the support systems and so forth, don't necessarily
                    stay the same. When I left in '79, I left with a very heavy heart. Rome was
                    tremendously difficult. We did end up loving it, which was important and good.
                    Then we were sent to New York, very unexpectedly, to the UDoug was Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick's Latin American specialist. I was given a nothing job that they
                    hadn't been able to fill for nine months because nobody could afford to do it.
                    And here again, one reason we had that tandem assignment was because I was
                    convenient for them. They could slam dunk me into it because we would have two
                    salaries and therefore they could get the job filled.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>New York turned out to be great. We had a good time. Mercier loved it. It was a
                    satisfying assignment in the final analysis. One makes do and creates things and
                    I ended up having a good time. But then we came back to Washington and it was
                    like starting all over again because I couldn't really go back to my old spouse
                    network because that wasn't my primary identity, that wasn't my primary modus
                    anymore. I was an officer now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they see you? The people who were still
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: They didn't think of me all that much. Lesley and I occasionally have
                    lunch and bump into each other. We're very tied by the nostalgia and the
                    experience that we shared at a certain time in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they sort of joke that, “Well, you're an officer now,
                        you're not really the same,” or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I think they sense that I care, I hope they sense that I care, that I
                    remain interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: But that I simply don't have time anymore to devote myself to these
                    issues. And these issues don't need me anymore. There was a time when they did.
                    They have served several generations of women now as vehicles for their own
                    empowerment, their own advancement. These women have contributed to the issue in
                    their own way and when their contribution is finished, you're at a new stage and
                    another woman will come forward to add her contribution.</p>
                <p>There was the generation of women who did all of the work on the Hill on the
                    annuities. There was the generation of women who did the second Forum. There was
                    the generation of women who did the foreign spouse issue. There was the
                    generation of women who did the evacuation issue, so I remain interested and
                    caring because One, it's a period of my life that was wonderful and satisfying
                    and full of accomplishment and good friends. Because I am still a spouse,
                    because I care about women and women's issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>But beyond a certain point it's artificial for me because that's not my world. It
                    is a major part of the world for women who are involved in those issues now and
                    I look at it in retrospect as - certainly it was a form of self-help for myself.
                    It was a political conviction. After a certain point, a certain amount of
                    ambition. I have a lot of political instincts and leadership instincts and it
                    was certainly a vent for that element of my being and creativity and so forth.
                    It was fun. It was exciting. It was uplifting. But I go into the FLO office
                    today and I'm just another person. Some of the people remember me. I used to be
                    introduced as a founding mother and I always loved that and that was maybe five,
                    six generations into FLO. Now it's so far removed, the people who are
                    there...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May not recognize you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Probably don't even recognize my name; so time marches on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about some of the difficulties as part of a
                        tandem couple. It appears that you might not have gotten as good assignments
                        sometimes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: You can't have it all. You can have it all - how do I say this? I believe
                    that it is extremely difficult to have it all and make it big. Occasionally an
                    extraordinary person does it. Donna Rhinak, for example, married late in life to
                    a wealthy jeweler who was able to support her. She had a child and she's
                    extremely talented and Louis takes care of her and makes life work for her and
                    makes it bearable. She's fantastic. A very bright woman, and she's a deputy
                    assistant secretary. I would say Donna has had it all and made it big.</p>
                <p>In general, however, I think you can have it all and make it small. That's how I
                    would characterize myself. Or you can have it big but not have it all. And you
                    have to choose. One of the reasons Donna has made it big and has it all is
                    because she's not married to a Foreign Service officer. She's married to a
                    gentleman whom she met in Mexico who is a businessman. He's a good deal older
                    than she is and he's at a certain stage in life, secure, able to go around with
                    her.</p>
                <p>I think it is virtually impossible for two Foreign Service officers to both make
                    it big, have it all - by that I mean marriage, family, children, and good work
                    all at the same time, and make it to the top. Carol and Ellsworth Bunker did it,
                    but it was a marriage late in life. She never had children. It would be
                    interesting to go through and see who the tandem ambassadors or tandem DCMs are.
                    I think they're probably very, very few.</p>

                        conscious of so that you decide together what assignments you should make
                        and who should take what, that sort of thing, in order to work this
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: One, we spend a lot of time in Washington which I love because it's where
                    policy is made and I think the policy is really where it's at. Two, we have been
                    flexible. We have settled for jobs that are less sexy, will get us less
                    recognition, from which we are less likely to be promoted. But we have stayed
                    together. I mean that for us is... Now, maybe there are some tandem ambassadors
                    and DCMs out there, but were they able to stay together? I believe that in the
                    final analysis, you're probably not going to be able to have everything and it's
                    just a question of what you're willing to sacrifice or what decisions are going
                    to be right for you at a given time, and it's going to be different for
                    different people.</p>
                <p>I think that Doug's career has suffered more than mine because his expectations
                    were greater. He came in assuming, desiring to be an ambassador. I don't think
                    that will happen. That hurts me. I think he thinks it won't happen now. He's an
                    office director in IO. You know maybe fate will strike again like that call out
                    of the blue, “Do you want to go to Rome?” Weird things like that happen in the
                    Foreign Service. You sort of have to keep the faith, and we don't know what's
                    going to happen. But I think his perception right now is he's not even sure
                    he'll be selected into the Senior Service, much less DCM or ambassador in
                    anyplace meaningful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you never know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: You never know, but he has definitely accepted jobs that were less
                    career-enhancing for him in order for us to be together and in order for me to
                    have a job. And in most of my cases, my jobs are not things that mainline
                    Foreign Service officers would ever want to do, but they have been extremely
                    career-enhancing for me. I've had a faster promotion rate than Doug has. I don't
                    fit in anybody's scheme of things. I've never done what I was supposed to. I've
                    only done what I wanted to which was a little off-beat and weird, but I've been
                    terribly satisfied and pleased while I was doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have accomplished a lot. It seems like everywhere you
                        went, you were awarded everything. Would you care to comment on that? I mean
                        that's really remarkable, looking at your list.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Well I don't know. Maybe I was just lucky and had bosses who were nice
                    people. I don't know. It's what I call “making it small.” Big fat important
                    people would sneer at being the Uruguay/Paraguay Desk officer. I thought it
                    wonderful because I like being in charge of things. I like doing everything. I
                    like being able to do it myself, not having a bunch of people around telling me
                    what to do. So I would much rather be the doyenne, the empress, the queen bee of
                    a small little ignored part of the world than officer number five on the UK
                    Desk. Forget it.</p>
                <p>So when I came into the Uruguay/Paraguay Desk I had a marvelous time because I
                    got to manage the U.S. relationship and role with Uruguay during its transition
                    back to democracy. During the hunt for Mengele, a major period of transition
                    with Stroessner, human rights issues in Paraguay, and not a leaf dropped in this
                    town that involved those two countries that people didn't check with me first,
                    including the ambassadors.</p>
                <p>And then I ended up running the state visit for President Sanguinetti of Uruguay.
                    First of all I got the visit on the docket, I got 30 million dollars that nobody
                    upstairs wanted to give to Uruguay through some machinations with the Congress
                    which, if anybody had known at the time, I'd have been kicked out for probably.
                    (laughs) I got 30 million dollars in ESL. Really exercised control and a major
                    role and influence on the planning and the development and the carrying off of
                    the visit itself, and got some nice kudos from Protocol in that regard.
                    Everything from testing the dinner menus to working up the visits for Mrs.
                    Sanguinetti, etc. And I had a perfectly marvelous time. At the end I didn't have
                    to share it with anybody. It was all mine. And people were impressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well obviously you had the good sense of what needed to be
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes. If I'd been on the UK desk, it would have been undistinguished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have been one of many.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: One of many. The award in Venezuela was because I managed to hold the
                    embassy together, do some very good things for the embassy in the face of a boss
                    who was very problematic and very difficult. Everyone thought that coming
                    down... They knew me and they knew him and they just said, “This is going to be
                    a disaster. She won't put up with him for five minutes.” And instead I worked
                    around him, I worked with him, I made lots of good things happen. The counselor,
                    who was most grateful because this one in the middle was really something to be
                    dealt with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>KINNEY: I don't want to name any names, but he's no longer in the Service. He was
                    the Admin Counselor at the time. But he was very impressed and very grateful for
                    what I did, and so that was where that award came from. I've gotten a lot of
                    awards in OES which is sort of embarrassing. I sort of think, “Oh, no, I've
                    gotten another one. It's going to devalue the currency.” But I have been
                    involved in some rather dramatic events. Each one has been more dramatic than
                    the last one, and so since they gave me an award for the first one, they said,
                    “My God, this is even bigger and better. We've got to give her an award for this
                    one. And then the next one is even bigger and better.”</p>
                <p>I have been involved for the last three years up until last June in the
                    negotiation of the framework Convention on Climate Change which is probably one
                    of the largest negotiations to ever take place. And the extraordinary thing is
                    that the only other negotiation similar to it was the Law of the Sea. That went
                    on for ten years and we didn't sign it in the end. This was done in eighteen
                    months and we signed it.</p>
                <p>Now I can't claim credit for that. It belongs mostly to the chief negotiator, Bob
                    Reinstein, but Bob and my immediate boss, Dan Reifsnyden and myself were
                    responsible for managing the policy, the inter-agency process, the negotiations,
                    the substantive side of the house. And in addition to that I essentially
                    coordinated and put on two major international negotiations from an operational
                    standpoint.</p>
                <p>There are three awards. The first one was for the working group, the RSWG, the
                    Response Strategies Working Group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                    Change, the IPCC. And I came into the office in July of '89 and it was a
                    disaster. No one knew what the name of the office was, they didn't know what an
                    embassy was, they were all civil servants. There was no Foreign Service in it.
                    They didn't know what a cable was, they didn't know how to do a cable. I was low
                    man on the totem pole and the United States was responsible for putting on a
                    major workshop in Geneva in October. The first of September, no work had been
                    done. No invitations had gone out, nothing. And so I came in and just did my
                    Foreign Service thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: That was '89. And it was a wild success. Everything went perfectly, it
                    went well. It was well organized. The Assistant Secretary was just grateful
                    beyond belief and impressed out of his mind. And I wasn't doing anything
                    special, I was just being a Foreign Service officer because that's what Foreign
                    Service officers do and they know how to do these things. And so I was very
                    surprised when I got the award. I had no idea anything exceptional had been
                    done, but they were so grateful, so that was that award.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>And then the following January, in '91 I guess it was, the United States was the
                    host to the Third Plenary of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change
                    which was a major international event involving over 75 national delegations,
                    countries. Within the UN context, it was a major negotiation over a report. The
                    President came, gave a speech. It was held at the Levi Center at Georgetown
                    University. I coordinated all of the operations, I made all that happen. And so
                    they gave me another award.</p>
                <p>And then the reward for doing well was more work of course. No, that was in '90.
                    Then in February of '91, it fell to the United States to host the first
                    negotiating session on a framework Convention on Climate Change which we hosted
                    at Chantilly, Virginia at Westfields International Conference Center. That was a
                    mega-UN production of about 140 countries and translators, procedure, the whole
                    bit. And I didn't do that one single-handedly, but I was right at the heart of
                    it. Stan and I insisted on that being a group award. I guess we'd gotten another
                    award for the IPCC and we'd gotten the award for Chantilly because it was bigger
                    and better and more impressive. That was a Superior Honor Group Award. And I
                    understand I'm about to be given another Superior for the work we did on
                    negotiating the convention itself.</p>
                <p>All I can say about OES is that they are very appreciative of hard and good work
                    and they do seek to recognize it. And on the other hand, I have been in a
                    situation where I have really gotten to participate in some unusual little
                    pieces of history involving the negotiation of one of the major treaties of this
                    decade. I was there, so I guess I was just very lucky or... (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did good work I'm sure. It sounds like
                        you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Another funny thing about the way life turns out. When I came into the
                    Service, you had to write an autobiography. I still have a copy of it someplace.
                    Towards the end, one of the paragraphs noted that I wanted to [work] in the soft
                    underbelly of the Department. By that I meant in global issues such as
                    environment, science and technology. That was back in '76. It wasn't a very
                    respectable ambition or goal then. I'm not sure that it is now. It's still not
                    very well integrated into the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is encouraged, however, I think, as part of a
                        multi-functional cone, possibly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: No, it's a sub-cone now and it's growing. But the interesting thing to me
                    is that we have not had leadership in OES that has built institutionally and
                    that integrated it very well with the Department because of the problems with
                    environmental policy and climate change in particular. Secretary Baker was
                    [lukewarm] on the issue and so we were out there really. We worked directly with
                    the White House ultimately because the Department was disconnected.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>But what is fascinating to me now of course is that with the advent of the
                    election of Clinton and Gore, a senator whom I got to know rather well during
                    the course of the climate negotiations because he was vigorously opposed to the
                    administration position and accompanied us on many of our negotiation sessions
                    and I was usually the control officer for him. His daughter is also one of the
                    best friends of my daughter. I'm going to be in OES at a very interesting time I
                    think. I'll be curious to see what the new administration does and how these
                    issues come of age.</p>
                <p>There's a major management study being done, which in fairness has been done at
                    the request of former Secretary Baker, called State 2000, and it is focused
                    primarily on how the Department of State needs to reorganize or modify itself in
                    order to do a better job with multilateral diplomacy, global issues, such as
                    environment, and economics. All three areas in which I have been intimately
                    involved in the last three years and in which I have developed a number of
                    obstreperous opinions. (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure they're useful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Right now, in fact, those kinds of institutional questions and debates
                    are of very great interest to me. I think that's one of the next areas in which
                    institutional work is needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask you a slightly different question. You
                        said that you felt your husband's career probably suffered more because you
                        are a tandem couple. Does he feel the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I think if he were honest he would, yes. He simply did not choose, in
                    order to accommodate certain family values and/or his wife, to do certain kinds
                    of jobs at certain points of his career that are important. And also he has
                    moved into the multilateral area. We're both in multi-lateral diplomacy now.
                    It's a lot harder, a lot more complex than the bilateral, but it's not rewarded
                    in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Because the Department is very slow to change and because the metier of
                    the Foreign Service is bilateral relations. Most of the multilateral diplomacy
                    is not done by the Foreign Service which is something that appalls, shocks and
                    scandalizes me, and I hope it will bother other people as they become more aware
                    of it. It's done by the Civil Service. For example, I was the only Foreign
                    Service officer in the Climate Negotiating Team and we had a team of about 20
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>So the Foreign Service is irrelevant to an awful lot of multilateral diplomacy
                    and yet multilateral diplomacy is becoming increasingly the negotiating mode for
                    many of the key issues. Anything that goes through the United Nations is
                    multilateral so from the Persian Gulf War to international environmental policy
                    to human rights to population, sustainable development, all of these issues are
                    multi-lateral, and the Foreign Service is relatively little involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting for me because I was recently
                        involved with two workshops at FSI. One was the negotiation arts and skills
                        and the other one was multilateral diplomacy. I was doing observation as a
                        linguist, too, how language was used and communication in negotiation and
                        different settings of negotiation. The sense I got was that everybody was
                        ready and would be willing to move into more multilateral diplomacy and what
                        I found was that, in general, they felt very little training and emphasis
                        was given...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Oh, I was appalled. The fact that I was involved in negotiating and
                    managing the policy formulation process which involved formulating the policy,
                    and then negotiating legally binding obligations for this country. And I didn't
                    have the foggiest notion what I was doing. Now the chief negotiator did, bless
                    his heart and thank God I was able to work with a master. And most of the
                    Foreign Service work is learned by doing and apprenticeship.</p>
                <p>But before Reinstein came on board, Dan Reifsnyden and I would sit down in these
                    interminable skull sessions late in the evening to talk about what had
                    transpired that day and what we thought the U.S. would have to do next week. The
                    blind leading the blind. We were guided by good sense, we were guided by what we
                    understood the White House wanted, we were guided by what was going to bite us
                    in the ankle next that we would have to contend with. We made it up as we went
                    along. There were no books, there were no guidelines, there were no how-tos for
                    doing this. I have a much better appreciation of the process now.</p>
                <p>I was dropped into Montreal Protocol in July and all I could think of... I left
                    Climate, went on vacation, spent two days in Washington, got my briefing books,
                    climbed on the plane and went to Geneva for a two-week negotiating session
                    there. All I could think of was “Thank God, thank God, I've been through
                    Climate. Otherwise I would be scared witless.” Montreal Protocol is a lot more
                    technical than Climate. I'm not a technical person, I don't have a scientific
                    technical background, don't really need it. The issue is politics. But had I
                    been dropped into it not having the Climate experience...</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>What I learned from Climate is that process is the product and I learned a lot of
                    the lingo, a lot of the code words, a lot of the policy issues are the same, the
                    big issues are the same. The tensions and dynamics and things to watch out for.
                    Now I know and can apply them to any environmental negotiation that I run into.
                    To a certain degree, there's a continuity and a similarity there. You just have
                    to learn the details that are different. But if I hadn't had the Climate
                    experience, I would have been absolutely lost. So one learns by doing.</p>
                <p>But it is strange to me that the Foreign Service, one, doesn't recognize
                    multilateral diplomacy as an issue of greater value than it does. That
                    recognizes it as at least as important as bilateral. When you come into the
                    Service, what you're basically taught is bilateral and maybe by circumstance for
                    a series of unpredictable reasons, but it's not given to you as a major
                    theme.</p>
                <p>UN conference diplomacy is a world unto itself. It's a vocabulary and a language
                    unto itself. It's a sub-culture. It's a mind-set, for Christ's sake. It's a mode
                    that is totally unique and I, at least, had never exposure one to it prior to
                    being dropped down in OES in the fall of 1989. I might add this was not a job
                    again that I sought. I actually sought and was assigned to the job that I have
                    now. But in the summer of 1989 when I got to the Department I was
                    unceremoniously told that the position had been moved and I was in this new
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to the position of the Deputy
                        Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well I didn't start out as a deputy. I started out as number three in the
                    office. This did not make me happy either, but the Deputy Director had small
                    children, was not up to the job and fortunately left. I was very glad that I'd
                    bided my time and kept a happy demeanor and emphasized the positive because she
                    eventually went and I was moved up to the position halfway through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was something else I was going to ask you now - it
                        kind of slipped my mind - relating to that. Oh, yes. I was thinking of the
                        diplomats in other countries since you mentioned that the U.S. does not
                        emphasize multilateral diplomacy. Is that your observation of diplomats of
                        other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: No, I think other countries by and large do it much better, do it much
                    more seriously than we do. Take a country like Brazil, for example. A small
                    country, small developing country. Bilaterally, what difference do they make?
                    They don't. They're too small. They're too inconsequential. It's not true for
                    Brazil, but smaller countries. But when they grouped together as the 77 at the
                    UN and they send people who are really, really good and they leave them there
                    for eight, ten years at a time, they master the mechanisms. We send amateurs,
                    leave them there for two years, three years at the most, and then yank them out
                    and send in another amateur.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very interesting. That was exactly what I heard from the
                        multilateral diplomacy workshop that I was involved with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: No, it's absolutely absurd. And the reason the UN got in the mess that it
                    got into - and it drives me nuts, but it's the best we've got - is that the U.S.
                    didn't take it seriously after a certain point. And so it stopped acting
                    seriously. We're taking it more seriously now. It was very interesting to be in
                    New York with Jeane Kirkpatrick because Moynihan started it, but Jeane really
                    was the one who came in and said, “By God, we're going to play in this game.
                    You're going to be accountable.” And we started taking names and kicking butts
                    and that was just fine. And there's a lot more that needs to be done.</p>
                <p>Certainly the fall of the Soviet Empire has put a whole new spin on things. All
                    of these environmental policy issues do some very interesting things. Climate
                    was fascinating. It fractured the 77. It is not a monolithic group, in part
                    because we're fifteen years further down the path of history, and different
                    countries are evolving at different rates and different speeds under different
                    conditions. What became clear in Climate, which was easier to paper over and
                    cover up when you had the east/west divide, was that these people don't have a
                    whole lot in common.</p>
                <p>And in Climate, we saw the creation of AOSOS, the Alliance of Small Ocean States.
                    The oil producing countries worked as a block, the poorest of the poor Africans,
                    the next, the newly industrializings, the Brazils, Indias and Chinas and Mexicos
                    of the world, the tigers. It's much easier to negotiate when you get the real
                    issues and interests out on the table.</p>
                <p>What's devilishly hard to accomplish anything is when you've papered it over with
                    a lot of fluff, lowest common denominator, that doesn't address anything in
                    realty, and that's what an awful lot of the rhetoric and mode of the 77 has been
                    for a long time. There's tremendous strain being put on that right now, and I
                    think one of the healthiest things that could happen is to see that group busted
                    up, for their own good, because development is possible, we need to identify the
                    winners, put them forward as models, demonstrate that it can be done, identify
                    what it is that holds the other ones back - faulty thinking, poor policy,
                    ideological dunderheadedness - and really hold people accountable. Developing
                    countries don't want to be treated like children. They don't want to be
                    disrespected. There's nothing in the world that people hate more than not being
                    taken seriously, and we have not taken then seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just like the spouse issues!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Exactly. So nothing really changes, you just move on and run into the
                    same dynamics someplace else.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's just different issues, but the same process. I can't
                        help but notice that there was a Vassar contingent. There were a number of
                        you who had been graduates of Vassar. I was hoping you would talk about
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: A felicitous coincidence. One day we were - well it was in the Lunch
                    Bunch, actually. We all had our rings on. We didn't realize we were all three
                    from Vassar and it sort of came out one day. Joan Wilson, Janet Lloyd and
                    myself. We were all graduates of Vassar when it was a woman's college, we were
                    all daughters of a very strong women's tradition that, as one of my classmates
                    said to Newsweek magazine when we were interviewed in 1966 when we were
                    graduating - we were there, class of The Group. The Group was published the year
                    we came in as freshman, so everybody was very interested in us when we left,
                    mostly from the sex angle. (laughter) But one of my friends I thought described
                    it best. She said, “It's like they stamp it on your forehead when you come in.
                    'Go out and do something significant.'”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a nice quote.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: That doesn't necessarily mean significant in terms of fame or world
                    changing, but I think meaningful is probably a better word. We were certainly
                    raised in a tradition with a very, very high expectation that women are capable,
                    women should go out and do, and they should make a difference where they can.
                    What we were imbued with most of all, I guess, blessedly, was confidence and
                    nurturing. We came from a tradition that told us at every corner we were
                    wonderful, that we could do anything we wanted to, and you just had to go out
                    and solve whatever the problem was at the moment. And I think that's probably
                    one of the most important qualities that any human being can experience growing
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that came from family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, certainly it came from family. My mother is a pianist and a very
                    creative and innovative person who's been zooming around causing trouble and
                    doing things ever since I can remember, so it never occurred to me not to work.
                    I just assumed that that's what you do. I was surprised to find out that there
                    was an issue about women working because I thought that, “Of course you work.” I
                    got my first job when I was thirteen. I wanted money to get those furry angora
                    sweaters in pastel colors with matched boxed pleated skirts that they were
                    selling down at Belks and the only way I was going to do it was to earn the
                    money, so I got a job so I could have my own clothes money. I'm horrified that
                    my daughter at age seventeen still has never had a job. She doesn't seem to show
                    any great inclination to go out and do it. On the other hand, this is Washington
                    and I grew up in a small town in Central Florida where everybody knew me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also she's been moved around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes, she's been moved around and it's very different getting a job in an
                    anonymous overpowering city than it is... I mean we just called up the manager
                    of the local department store. You know my daddy owned a store and that daddy
                    talked to another daddy, and Stephanie had a job. Next summer, I wanted to work
                    at the bank. We called the president of the bank and here I had another job. So
                    I have to be careful not to be too critical of her. It was very easy, much
                    easier for me.</p>
                <p>I think childhood for many people in my generation was much easier than it is for
                    children today. The questions that they have to make decisions about by the age
                    of fourteen or fifteen, sex, drugs, just never entered my world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a coincidence, also, that you were all holding
                        important positions? You know, Janet Lloyd was the first FLO Director and
                        Joan Wilson was very - was she the Director of OBC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well she originally worked, I think, with Dorothy Stansbury on the old
                    seminar for spouses and then she was very instrumental in the creation of the
                    OBC because she moved from the creation of the spouse course to... She
                    identified the need for information about posts and things, and she really
                    forged the creation of that. Barbara Hoganson was her deputy, as I recall. I
                    think it just comes from being who we were. We were women who were fortunate to
                    be well-educated, to have been brought forth in circumstances that One,
                    encouraged us to do things and Two, permitted us to do things.</p>
                <p>And we were problem-solvers. We were all very committed to the proposition that
                    women did have a rough row to hoe in the Foreign Service, particularly spouses,
                    since spouses were overwhelmingly female in those days, and that as women, we
                    should do something about our situation. That was silly to let that go on. If
                    you were going to complain about it, you should go do something about it. So we
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. Well I'm sure that we all benefited from all of you
                        who did all this work, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: But I don't know. My life is full, as you can see, of these little things
                    that at one period of time connect with another of time. Vassar and Vassar,
                    Foreign Service, Foreign Service, global issues, global issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you knew what you wanted. I think that was a
                        significant part of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>KINNEY: I have always known what I wanted. I don't know where I get that from or
                    why I have the temerity, but I guess I was never discouraged from wanting. I was
                    never told that it was bad or that I didn't have the right to want. And so One,
                    I have wanted, but I have also assumed that it was up to me to go out and get
                    it. That's part of the fun. You certainly can't expect for it to be given to you
                    on a silver platter. But the more you do and the more you get, the better
                    positioned you are to have additional opportunities present themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And control over what you wanted to happen as well, I'm
                        sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: But if I haven't always known what I've wanted, I guess I've always known
                    what I didn't want. FLO really started out with knowing that I didn't want my
                    husband to have to choose between his career and me. And I didn't want to have
                    to choose between having a career and him. So the only alternative was to change
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To change it. Perfect!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: So that's what I set out to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any final comments on the... It's been twenty
                        years since the 1972 Directive and many things have happened and you have
                        accomplished a lot. FLO is certainly working very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I think American diplomacy has suffered. I think that American families,
                    American spouses, contributed a unique and valuable dimension to our
                    representation of who we are, what our interests are and what we're about to
                    people overseas. I think the loss of that contribution has been to our
                    detriment. There are now posts overseas where there are no families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like when they're not allowed to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: No, they're just single people, divorced people, gay people. But the
                    American family is not vital and present. Most of the rest of the world values
                    tradition and families as a priority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting. I have to interrupt because when
                        I was at Jewell Fenzi's yesterday, she received a letter from an ambassador
                        - I forgot his name. She's been corresponding with him. He made a comment in
                        his letter that the Foreign Service can work without families. Officers
                        without families.</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Oh, no problem, no problem. It depends on what you want to represent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: It depends on how you want to be understood and viewed. We can have a
                    Foreign Service of dwarfs. Is that what you want to be represented overseas? In
                    the final analysis it requires discrimination, that is to say discriminating,
                    choosing between one option or another option. And we are a fragmented and
                    chaotic society in transition coming from something and going toward we're not
                    quite sure what. We're not going to get there for another decade or so and the
                    country, two decades from now, is going to look very different. It's going to
                    think very differently than the one that I grew up in.</p>
                <p>But those values which attract - democracy, respect for the individual, honor,
                    fair play - a word which can't be translated in many languages - honesty,
                    rational problem-solving pragmatic process, enduring values, some dimension of
                    spirituality, and in that I include some respect and recognition of family
                    because that's continuity, are the things that draw other countries to us. Not
                    because we're the United States or because we have the biggest army or because
                    we have the wealthiest economy. In the final analysis - those things certainly
                    don't hurt. Brute power is very useful. But in the final analysis, the reason we
                    are still here and the Soviet Union is not is because of the values. Is because
                    of what we stood on and stood for. And if we don't manifest that, if that is not
                    what people know when they know us, why should they want to be associated with
                    us?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And without a family you can't really...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: And I think myself that the family, the contribution of entertaining in
                    the home, of vital, alive, active women who are linking with the wives of the
                    other important people in the country, is an essential element of good
                    diplomacy. I think they should be paid for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bravo!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I think they should be required to do it as a condition of employment. If
                    that's not the way you want to spend your life as a couple, you shouldn't come
                    in the Foreign Service. But if you come in the Foreign Service, state clearly
                    what the condition of employment is, why we're doing it, what the value added
                    is, and then pay for it. And then and only then will we have what I would
                    consider to be serious diplomacy again. I think we had it once. I think we
                    don't.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I think we have serious policy debate. I think we have serious contest of policy,
                    but I don't think that's the sum total of diplomacy. I think diplomacy is in a
                    certain dimension a question of art. It's a question of feel. It's a question of
                    tone, it's a question of posture. It's a question of drawing people in. And as I
                    said, I don't think brute force is something on which we should rely
                    exclusively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like a perfect note to end this interview, but
                        I do want to ask then how does the tandem couple fit into this picture when
                        both officers are working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: With difficulty, with difficulty. One way to have family is to move
                    toward a more conscious policy of tandem employees. It will be a bitch to
                    administer, and we will have to go back to the way the personnel system used to
                    work, which frankly I think was pretty good. That is, the races to the fastest.
                    Inside jobs, who you know, corridor reps, I mean forget equality. But I've
                    always maintained that if you're not smart enough to figure out how to make your
                    way in the informal system in the diplomatic corps, what in the world is to make
                    us think that you've got any chance at all or that we should have any confidence
                    in you at all in negotiating with the Chinese!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. I think you have a very good point there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I don't have a problem with - how shall I say - unbureaucratic systems.
                    They tend to work out pretty well. They're not always equitable. Out groups have
                    a hard time getting in. But maybe in another five or six years, the out groups
                    in the Foreign Service will have developed enough confidence, enough know-how,
                    enough force that they can start acting on their own rather than as groups. And
                    it'll just be individuals again. And the races to the swiftest. You'll have to
                    work it out, because there's no way that it can be absolutely equitable. It's a
                    big problem. For all these things, it probably won't happen. I think ideally you
                    probably don't manage... There's another element here and that is, to what
                    degree are we manifesting ourselves as culturally American overseas?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As opposed to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KINNEY: As opposed to... A large number of spouses - I'm going to get in trouble
                    on this one - as opposed to a large number of spouses who are foreign born and
                    have not necessarily culturally assimilated. And I'm drawing some distinctions
                    here and making some value judgements that would get me in deep hot water with
                    all the political correctness around, but if you don't speak English well, if
                    you haven't incorporated a certain fundamental understanding of this country,
                    its history, its culture, its impulses, and you are not perceived by others as
                    American, and I think that's the distinguishing characteristic. A few people
                    that's fine. It shows that we're open, we love immigrants, and we don't
                    discriminate and all that. But when you get up to fifty percent of the embassy
                    population being perceived as not American, then maybe you ought to think about
                    that a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: It's a very delicate subject. I wouldn't touch this one publicly with a
                    ten-foot pole, but here again I'm looking at it from an institutional, from a
                    professional point of view, and this is without malice or recrimination for any
                    individual, any group. You know, immigrants versus residents versus native-born
                    or what have you. It comes down to, “What is the purpose of our job?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all, you are representing the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: What is it that you want to be projecting? I think you ought to have that
                    better defined and more consciously decided and projected and disciplined than
                    we currently feel comfortable with doing, because what it means ultimately is
                    implying, and explicitly so in some cases, this is preferable to that. And we
                    are scared to death of that because of the legal system, because of the
                    politics, because of the political correctness, because of all the rest. So it's
                    not an idea whose time has come.</p>
                <p>But I would predict, as we have to deal with competition for the first time in
                    our lives... The United States has been fat and sassy ever since World War II.
                    It's not had any significant competition. We're entering in an era where we are
                    going to have to fight and scrabble for our place in the world, to hold onto our
                    authority and our power, and we are going to be much more conscious, much more
                    political, much more strategic and tactical about the way we deploy our
                    resources, including our diplomats. And the style and the messages that we send
                    and all the rest. We can't afford to not care, to be nonchalant, to be super Mr.
                    Joe Kool, laid-back, it don't matter none, we can do anything we jolly well want
                    because, well we're who we are and the individual above all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's more than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KINNEY: But that one's going to be a while coming yet because we're going to
                    have, I think, have a greater appreciation of our need to compete with Japan and
                    our need to compete with the E.C. We're going to have to get a little more
                    serious about it. I still think we have probably one of the finest corps in the
                    world, but as a disciplined corps, I think there's some questions today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any more comments on this - well it's a little
                        harder for you now, I guess, since you're really an officer - but comments
                        on the spouses of today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: I am tremendously impressed by the competency and the skill and the
                    education of the younger generation. I think it's sad that they do not have
                    masters and mentors, role models that they can really sort of go “Oooh!”
                    Professional role models. The Department is very, very much more politicized
                    than when I came in. When I came in, the assistant secretaries were all Foreign
                    Service officers. When I came in the DAS's were all Foreign Service officers by
                    and large. When I came in, the older generation prided itself on who their
                    prodigies were. It was not by accident that my husband was plucked up for Rome.
                    They looked for good people, they nurtured them, they cultivated them.</p>
                <p>Now a certain amount of that still goes on. But it is much more difficult because
                    we are so much more diverse, because Foreign Service officers do not control the
                    assistant secretaryships and the deputy assistant secretaryships anymore. We
                    don't have the grand names. I remember the Ellsworth Bunkers and the David
                    Bruces and Roy Atherton, Bob McBride. And there was a generation before that
                    where the names were even more illustrious. They were not people with whom I was
                    associated with. I mentioned Ellsworth Bunker and David Bruce, neither of whom
                    were Foreign Service officers per se, but tremendously accomplished individuals.
                    Max Campbellton, maybe today a lot of people remember.</p>
                <p>But within the Foreign Service itself, we don't seem to be generating the
                    inspiring and inspired leadership among senior officers that we once had. Thomas
                    Pickering does a fantastic job, but what happens to him? He does too well and he
                    gets kicked out of USUN and gets sent to India. That's wonderful for India that
                    Tom is there! But he has to fight for his own political survival. He doesn't
                    really have time to come back and nurture and play grandfather to the Foreign
                    Service, nor do many of the other senior officers. Because everybody is under
                    the gun, because you're going to be gone if you don't move on. So that quality
                    of life... It's very difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>There are some women, and I certainly try to do it with young women who come
                    along, you know women looking after women, Blacks looking after Blacks, Chinese
                    looking after Chinese, and white males looking after white males and if they try
                    to look after women, well they have to be very careful because, my gosh, you
                    know, maybe chemistry breaks out and that's always dangerous. It's a very, very
                    much more difficult situation. On the other hand I know a couple of male
                    officers who regularly cultivate - they are known. “Link up with him because he
                    likes women, he promotes them actively.”</p>
                <p>So the opportunities, the experiences are still there, but I don't have the sense
                    that the younger officers are necessarily getting - and I may be totally wrong
                    on this - are necessarily getting the kind of mentoring and nurturing that they
                    once did. It would be interesting to ask them. Maybe they feel very differently.
                    I do know that an awful lot more people are coming in and leaving than used to
                    be the case. I mean, by and large Foreign Service officers tend to stay, but my
                    sense is... I'm very distressed by a statistic from two years ago. The question
                    is, who are we getting? Two years ago, no one from the Georgetown School of
                    Foreign Service applied to the Foreign Service. It used to be our major feeder
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well, the Foreign Service has made it very clear that kind of specialized
                    expertise in policy training is not necessarily what it cares about anymore.
                    Other factors are more important than merit. The pay is not as good. A lot of
                    them went to Wall Street. There are other opportunities out there. The fact
                    remains there is still only one place that you can do U.S. foreign policy, and
                    that's in the Department of State. And that's what hooks most people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they are going to change the name of the Foreign
                        Service Institute to reflect that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: What are they going to say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to think. It's like the “School for
                        Diplomacy.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Diplomacy or something? I think that's wonderful because I think that we
                    need to bring diplomacy back into the Foreign Service. I think we have been so
                    mechanized, so trivialized, infantalized, bureaucratized, mericraticized to
                    death that we've lost sight of the art.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly none of the Thomas Jefferson State.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>KINNEY: Yes, and we need to look back and seek inspiration and seek a mission
                    again. It's the right time in history. The Cold War has been put aside. We're
                    going to see a proliferation of conflict and fragmentation and brush wars the
                    likes of which we didn't think were possible four or five years ago. The nice
                    thing about the Soviet Union was that it provided a certain amount of stability.
                    There was tension, there was threat, but at least, better the devil you know
                    than the devil you don't. Now we're going to see every Tom, Dick and Harry
                    seeking his ambition and raising hell all over the place and it's going to be a
                    real problem.And we're going to have to compete. So it's a very exciting time, I
                    think, and I'll be curious to see what comes, what the new balance is. I would
                    hope that there is a better balance between bilateral and multilateral in the
                    way we train people, the way we prepare them, the way we urge them to think
                    about it, the way we value the work they do. I would hope that there is a better
                    balance among groups and interests in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I would hope that there is, frankly, more discrimination and greater courage to
                    say some things are more important than others. And sorry if that gores your ox,
                    but that's just the way it is. The most important thing is not being a good
                    hotelier for CODELs. The most important thing is developing an elite, in the
                    best sense of the word, meaning most accomplished, most experienced, most
                    skilled. Not snobby, not classist, not racist, but the true meaning of the word.
                    A sophisticated cadre of men and women who can navigate the rather choppy waters
                    into which we're about to head. And in the final analysis, who are prepared to
                    serve, I guess. I come back to Carol Laise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can't imagine that. This has been such a great
                        experience for me, really, to talk to you about all these things. It's
                        really very [insightful].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KINNEY: Well thank you. But you have given me a great opportunity. I have never
                    talked about them like this before. So you've forced me to think about some
                    things and articulate some things. I find myself articulating some feelings that
                    I haven't really shared or thought about for a while, and that's very nice.
                    Thank you.</p>

                        so enlightening. Also encouraging in a way, I think, to know that you can be
