                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Steve Low was the director of the Foreign Service
                        Institute at the time the National Foreign Affairs Training Center vision
                        began to be converted into a reality. Steve, if you would give us some idea
                        of what in 1982 Arlington Hall was about and what indeed was happening in
                        the Foreign Service Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOW: I came to FSI in 1982; I had never heard of Arlington Hall. Secretary Haig
                    selected me. He felt very strongly about training and he interviewed personally
                    all the candidates. He selected me and I came in following a year as Diplomat in
                    Residence at the University of California at Santa Barbara.</p>
                <p>It didn't take very long to realize there were three or four things that I could
                    do that were important in terms of training. I felt then, as I feel now, that we
                    were a unique institution. We were a training institution as opposed to an
                    educational one. By that, I mean, we took educated people and provided them with
                    a skill which would permit them to perform their job better. One exception was
                    our economics course which was a basic education course. But for the most part,
                    we were a training institution.</p>
                <p>In the three areas of language, area studies, and professional studies, I had a
                    very strong feeling that we should be the best there is in the United States. We
                    should provide leadership and be respected as an institution of excellence. To
                    do that meant, it seemed to me, opening doors, being sure that we had within us
                    the best people. That was a major thrust and meant doing a number of things. One
                    of the things we did was to create the Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs.
                    It was to be kind of a think tank where we would bring in private sector
                    (business, labor, media) and academia to discuss issues of current policy
                    concern with people in government. FSI provided the perfect forum for this kind
                    of thing. Everyone felt at ease, the people in government and out of government.
                    That was central to the concept of an effective FSI, a place where one could
                    come and feel at ease to discuss frankly the major issues we were concerned
                    about. It was a place for individuals, both inside and outside of government, to
                    spend a few months, particularly Foreign Service Officers, if they had an
                    interval and there was something they really wanted to study.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Second was the home for FSI. I don't know at what point John Sprott and I talked
                    about this at great length. We decided we were never going to have a first class
                    institution in the physical surroundings in Rosslyn. We were spread all over,
                    there was no feeling of unity. For an entry level class of Foreign Service
                    Officers, the training facilities must have represented their first deception.
                    After all, there was the tremendous build up of a year and a half of selecting
                    only 150 out of 15,000 applicants. He or she then walked into a windowless room
                    with a poster on Greece, and that was the entire relationship with 200 years
                    history of American Diplomatic experience.</p>
                <p>An article I ran across showed a picture of one of the most attractive buildings
                    I remember seeing on an island in a lake. That building had the name of
                    Hamburger University and it was where McDonald's did its training. I wrote
                    McDonald and got a picture of the building and a letter from them describing
                    their degree in “hamburgerology.” I hung that on my wall. I used to say to
                    visitors that if American society could afford to put this kind of resources
                    into those who make its hamburgers, it should be able to do better for those who
                    conduct its foreign policy. The postal union, the FBI, everyone had training
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>My training at FSI started off in an apartment building then moved to the garage
                    of Arlington Towers. Then for 25 years we were in the Rosslyn high rise where we
                    spent a significant amount of time waiting for elevators; where the population
                    density of the rooms were such that you couldn't move easily; restroom
                    facilities were inadequate to take the volume at breaks. It was simply
                    unsatisfactory. It contributed to the old, I think unfortunate, proclivity of
                    Foreign Service Officers to feel sorry for themselves and feel American society
                    did not appreciate their contributions. We felt very strongly that the new
                    training center should be a U.S. government facility much more than a narrow
                    Foreign Service or State Department facility. For a start we brought in an USIA
                    officer as one of the deans of one of the schools.</p>
                <p>But to get back to the facilities, it was very shortly after we were there that
                    we went down three paths. One, creating the center; two, finding a new site; and
                    three, setting up a little later a non-profit organization which would support
                    training and do things for training that the government couldn't do. Secretary
                    Haig, when he left, had someone in his office whom they needed to find a place
                    for. They asked us to take him, he came to work for us and we had absolutely
                    nothing for him to do. We told him to look around, to see if there wasn't some
                    spot somewhere that we could consider moving to. For two or three months he
                    inquired.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I recall going up to Mt. Vernon Girls' School, which was in desperate straits at
                    that point, to ask how permanent they were. And there was some other property up
                    on Foxhall Road that was vacant. He did quite a bit of research on various
                    places. But, I have to say, the under secretary wasn't terribly interested in
                    this proposition and we didn't push it very hard. We were just inquiring. That
                    individual left and we got a new executive director who was more interested. At
                    that point John Sprott had said, “Well, there is always Arlington Hall. People
                    always mention that in connection with us.” It was an 87 acre plot of rolling
                    land and trees about 10 minutes from the State Department out route 50. At the
                    time it housed SIGCOM—the Army signals command which, we were to discover, was
                    rapidly being outgrown. I suggested we go out there for lunch. So we inquired
                    and went out to the Officers' Club for lunch, and we became very interested.
                    This was maybe early to mid 1983.</p>
                <p>We had always heard, John said, that there was no chance of our getting Arlington
                    Hall. There was a provision in the contract or an understanding that if the Army
                    moved out it should revert to Arlington County. I found in this whole effort
                    that one of the biggest elements is getting the information. It took a good six
                    months to find out what the real state of affairs was with regard to this
                    place.</p>
                <p>The most important thing that happened, I think, was that we got a new Under
                    Secretary for Management, Ron Spiers. He was very supportive and very interested
                    in training, as had been his predecessor. But Ron had imagination and was a
                    believer that things could be done. The FSI executive officer, Frank Ravndal,
                    went out to see the Arlington County people. The person he talked to, Bill
                    Hughes, told him a little bit about the set up here. He said that as far as he
                    could see the Army had to move because it wanted to expand and do things that
                    the County said they could not do. The County never really expected that the
                    federal government would really turn the property back to it. He thought that
                    having FSI there would be about the best alternative the County could hope for.
                    He thought it was a good idea. Frank Ravndal came back with that piece of news.
                    Then we went to Ron Spiers. But there were two other things that happened that
                    peeked our interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In my first presentation of the budget, I went to the OMB and was explaining what
                    we were planning to do. OMB asked whether what we wanted to do would be possible
                    once we moved to Columbia Plaza. I knew nothing about moving to Columbia Plaza.
                    They insisted it was right there in the submission from the controller. FSI
                    would move to Columbia Plaza. Well, that was the first I had heard of it and I
                    would have to consider it. I knew in my own mind immediately that was an
                    impossible suggestion. No training school could exist across the street from the
                    State Department. People would come to class and leave in the middle of it to go
                    to a meeting, or they would rush out to finish a memo. To be effective, a
                    training institution must be far enough away so that it is independent and
                    people will commit themselves to the learning process, but close enough so that
                    you can get people to come out to teach, lecture and attend classes. In other
                    words, ten or fifteen minutes away, if it was going to work. Anyway, Columbia
                    Plaza was still another rented office building. It would be the last place in
                    the world we should move to. Still we didn't entirely abandon the idea of being
                    across the street.</p>
                <p>One of the things we looked into at great length was the naval medical facility.
                    I think the CIA has part of it and we looked at that. We also looked across the
                    street at the pharmaceutical building just to see if there were any
                    possibilities there. But Columbia Plaza seemed to me to be a crazy idea and I
                    said under no circumstances as director would I consider it. And then, about six
                    months later, still in 1983 or early 1984 I was walking down the hall and there
                    was a mock-up of the new State Department building which was to be put up by
                    private enterprise and leased back to us. It had a big sign—The new FSI. I
                    wondered whether anyone ever consulted FSI on this kind of thing?</p>
                <p>This was to be a great opportunity, a marvelous place, L'Enfant Plaza, right in
                    the middle of the city. And we could have the upper two floors. We had a staff
                    meeting and tossed it around. Two or three of our deans were quite enthusiastic
                    about the idea, anything to get out of where we were. And again I said it didn't
                    make sense to go to another office building, leased quarters. I guess we went
                    around the table and I think the majority were in favor. I'm afraid, I said, I
                    vote against it and the no's have it. The Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration, a good friend, would hardly speak to me for weeks after that.
                    Ron Spiers at that point called me in and told me he had sent his goals and
                    objectives to the Secretary and his number one goal was a new facility or new
                    campus for FSI. That really blew me away because to have the Under Secretary for
                    Management really take an interest like that was a completely new thing and
                    important.</p>
                <p>We had one other interesting ally on the Hill. Congressman Fascell was Chairman
                    for the Subcommittee on Government Operations of the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, and he had a staffer, Ginny Schlundt, who could be difficult but had
                    a very strong feeling of proprietorship as far as the State Department was
                    concerned and was very supportive of training. Ginny, without consulting us, put
                    in her report to the subcommittee that FSI should be moved to an appropriate
                    location in a campus setting. That helped us enormously. I got lots of copies of
                    that and used it to show we had congressional support.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We discovered yet a new possibility. Somewhere along the line, the Pentagon said
                    there were eleven acres at the north end of the Pentagon parking lot which they
                    would give us. I reported this to Ron and he said maybe we should grab it. There
                    was a lot of pressure beginning to mount for us to take advantage of the offer.
                    It was available “tomorrow” and we could move quickly while we had the
                    opportunity. At this point I guess, (my chronology is faulty because I don't
                    remember exactly just when some of these meetings occurred) I got a call that
                    the Secretary wanted to see me. I went into George Shultz's office and he had
                    the Counselor of the Department, Ed Derwinski, with him. He said something to
                    the effect that, “Steve, I have been thinking about this training thing. As you
                    know, it is a subject that greatly interests me. FSI is not in an appropriate
                    place. I want you to find a place and take the responsibility of getting FSI an
                    appropriate location. I want you to do it. Ed Derwinski is here, and I am
                    charging him to help you in whatever way you need help and I will be checking up
                    on the progress.”</p>
                <p>Well, Ron had put him up to it. That is why there are so many elements to this.
                    Shultz was a manager, he planned personnel. He tried to get Personnel to do what
                    he had done in Bechtel; planning ahead for needs and training. He was a firm
                    believer in the importance of training and he saw the importance of this to the
                    Foreign Service. So I had my marching orders. Without these people above me, we
                    wouldn't have had a chance.</p>
                <p>Then, another element came along, it was Arlington County. Bill Hughes, the
                    person Ravndal talked to who was at FSI for the inauguration went to his bosses
                    and got confirmation of his view that if the County couldn't keep Arlington
                    Hall, they would prefer FSI to any other government entity. They went to
                    Congressman Frank Wolf. Mr. Wolf called me in and we had long conversations on
                    the subject. He became a strong supporter. We had our ups and downs. In part, he
                    wanted the County to benefit from this and we talked about it getting use of
                    some of the property. In the initial moments, the idea of our using the whole 87
                    acres was inconceivable. Ron and I talked about splitting it in half and giving
                    half to someone else. We had no idea that we could use all this space. It seemed
                    extravagant. And OMB was scoffing at the idea. It was not at all positive on the
                    idea. There were others that thought it was extravagant and unnecessary. But the
                    Secretary pushed hard. He started his weekly staff meetings by asking what was
                    happening at FSI? People wondered what I had been doing behind their backs to
                    get the Secretary so charged up on the subject. And I must admit, I didn't do
                    anything to discourage it.</p>
                <p>We had a meeting. I guess I had brought up the issue of the Pentagon parking lot.
                    We had the whole senior staff in; there must have been about twenty people.
                    Again, I told them I wasn't going to have my name associated with a building
                    that was at the end of the runway at National Airport, where every time a plane
                    took off someone would ask who was the bright guy who chose this idiotic
                    location. It just didn't make any sense to me and I said I would rather not
                    move. We had only one chance and if we didn't make it right we wouldn't get
                    another. It was better to stay put than take some place that was unsatisfactory.
                    Reluctantly, people went along with me. At that point we got legislation
                    drafted, with Derwinski's help.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Yet another amusing incident, I got a call from the Assistant Secretary of the
                    Army for Administration. I had been to see him a couple of times and he had
                    shown himself sympathetic to our interest. It was pretty clear he thought we
                    could help what he knew he had to do—move the Army out of Arlington Hall. He
                    wanted SIGCOM to move to Fort Belvoir but was having little luck getting
                    congressional support. We alerted the House Foreign Affairs Committee which
                    asked the Armed Services Committee staff about it. For the first time the latter
                    became interested in the matter and went out to take a look. Not surprisingly it
                    was appalled at conditions there, for truly the World War temps in which people
                    were working were falling apart. So the Army saw a positive value in cooperating
                    with us. I should mention that throughout our effort the H Bureau (Congressional
                    Relations) gave us a free hand. I tried to keep them informed of what we were
                    doing but they let us pretty well alone—no doubt because of the Secretary's well
                    known interest. For the most part I handled the matter by myself with John
                    Sprott's constant support and advice and frequently action to cover me with his
                    wide circle of contacts in the Department, particularly in the Comptroller's
                    office and Administration. Anyway, the Army Assistant Secretary—I believe his
                    name was Johnson—called me one day and said he needed fifteen acres of the
                    property back. I told him I didn't have fifteen acres to give him. He said if we
                    would agree that the National Guard could have fifteen acres he would support
                    us. We had been up to talk to Ginny and others in the House Foreign Affairs
                    committee and told them of the importance of getting army support. So we had yet
                    another important backer at that point. If we hadn't lined up all that support
                    we could never have gotten the legislation approved. We lined up Senator Warner,
                    both because of the County and the Army. He was the senior Republican and
                    minority leader of the Armed Services Committee.</p>
                <p>At that time the Executive Director changed and Bill Kemp came in. John, Bill and
                    I would meet each evening. We had an imaginary chart on the wall which was a
                    line of progression of our expectations. And we'd speculate what percentage of
                    chance we had of getting this in the final analysis. Never did we get it above
                    20 percent chance of eventually getting this campus, a new building, and a new
                    facility. I don't know when that changed because it was very difficult to follow
                    the progress. We were very distant from Congress and it is hard to keep informed
                    on these things. But everyone in the Department knew this was my project. People
                    would duck when I entered the room because they saw me as a single-issue person.
                    In fact we had created our Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs and had
                    created the Association for Diplomatic Studies. But it was true that we were
                    spending about half of our time on the question of relocation.</p>
                <p>Support for the new facility got past the House and went into conference. It was
                    part of the Armed Services bill. The State Department Foreign Affairs Committee
                    supported it but the initiative had to come from the Army. The Army wanted our
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there another party that wanted this property?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LOW: Not that I ever heard of. There was one major fly in the ointment. That was
                    the Committee on Government Organization, Jack Brooks of Texas was chairman and
                    he was tough. There was a piece of legislation of which he was the parent which
                    said that any government property which was no longer needed by its occupant
                    must go through a process by which it is advertised to all government agencies.
                    Anyone interested in the property could then state their needs which would be
                    examined and on the basis of that, awarded to the most deserving. I knew that if
                    we had to go through that process, there was no way the State Department would
                    end up with the property. In the middle of the proceedings, Brooks raised a
                    fuss. We were at the edge of the precipice and he said he was going to amend the
                    legislation to read if the Army transfers the property to the State Department
                    then it would have this, that and the other thing. Well, we had a difficult time
                    following it, but we knew there was a terrible threat. I can't tell you to this
                    day what happened in that conference committee, but Warner and Wolf together
                    thwarted that effort to derail advertising to all government agencies about the
                    property.</p>
                <p>It took us two weeks to learn whether the bill had passed and that the provision
                    in fact transferred the property from the Army to the State Department. That was
                    a turning point. We then realized we had a good chance that the whole project
                    would go through. The momentum then started to build.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is curious, you were offered nine acres of land in back
                        of the Pentagon's parking lot, and here you have 72+. Did it occur to you
                        that maybe this was much vaster than we could justify occupying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOW: Yes, that was true and what my answer when people raised that was the County
                    wanted to use part of it and we would let them do so. Of course, after I left it
                    became evident that we were going to use virtually all of it. I remember
                    Congressman Wolf called me out of the blue one day after I had retired and was
                    in Bologna Italy as Director of the Johns Hopkins University Graduate
                    School—International Relations there. He reminded me of our “promise” that they
                    could have some of the property. I admitted only that I had said that whatever
                    part we weren't using would make available to the County.</p>
                <p>I didn't mention the fact that part of Wolf's support was a quid pro quo that we
                    go to town meetings around the County explaining how we were going to use the
                    property. Generally, we were effective in getting support from the communities
                    and that allowed us to keep Wolf's support. He felt that if we could satisfy his
                    constituents he would support us. We had a terrible time with the intelligence
                    alumni. They wanted that building, Old Main, preserved and they argued with me
                    about all kinds of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I remember coming out here with the prominent Washington architect, Hugh
                    Jacobson, and going through the building. After we were all finished he stood
                    and said, and I remember his words exactly, “charming but expendable.” We said
                    at that point we were not going to keep it because it would cost us a fortune.
                    We knew it was full of asbestos and would be a lot cheaper to tear down and
                    start from scratch. The intelligence officers association won that argument, the
                    building was saved. In the event they were right and we were wrong. It is a
                    beautiful building and I think it is a great asset to the complex.</p>
                <p>I don't know what the ultimate disposition of the nine or ten acres on the other
                    side of George Mason will be. But we had promised what we didn't use we would
                    make available.</p>
                <p>I left in early 1987, I was at FSI for five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Armed Services legislation was in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOW: Yes, then the spotlight moved to getting appropriations. By that time
                    Secretary Shultz realized we had made enough progress that this was a real
                    possibility. He really went to bat for us. We were told that the Secretary said
                    the relocation of the school was his first priority. When a Secretary of State
                    says that, Congress is very supportive. So we did get the initial funds to
                    develop the site plan. The conceptual design on the site plan showed a building
                    in a donut shape. If I am not mistaken, there is a picture of it on the cover or
                    the Foreign Service Journal showing me standing in front of the mock-up of the
                    donut-shape building.</p>
                <p>The initial conceptual survey we had done concluded that the project was
                    practical, that we could use this space for this purpose. Later John Sprott and
                    directors Charles Bray and Brandon Grove did a lot of work on providing Congress
                    and later administrations cost benefit studies indicating that in the long run
                    this would save money for the U.S. Government. We were paying almost a million
                    annually in rent, so it was demonstrable that a permanent home would be cost
                    beneficial.</p>
                <p>The next step was the site survey, which took an incredibly long time—six months
                    or something. Then we moved to the design competition which was an interesting
                    process. I think the GSA took over at that point and advertised an RFP in the
                    Federal Register. There were something like 184 applications. GSA said they had
                    never had such a high number of applications to bid on a federal government
                    structure. Nobody submitted any concepts at all. GSA studied the 184 and reduced
                    it to 30, then ten, and finally five, on the basis of studying the firms and
                    their capabilities and records. It was only at that point they invited
                    competition.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The five firms submitted their design concepts. A board of architects and
                    contractors, all government people, of which I was a member met to consider the
                    designs. I think there was a recognition that my decision would be pretty
                    important. Initially I leaned toward a single building, in the shape of a cross,
                    would be the best for us, less expensive. I was very concerned to get as much
                    building for the least money. Two or three of the other board members were
                    architects. During a coffee break they pulled me aside and told me I was making
                    a terrible mistake. They felt one design in particular was head and shoulders
                    above the others. So I started studying it and the more I looked at it, the more
                    impressed I became about it. I had come to the realization a few months before
                    that even with the best piece of real estate in the world, and all the money you
                    need, you could still come up with a design that was quite unsatisfactory. That
                    had not occurred to me before. It seemed to me, if you could start from scratch,
                    you could produce what you wanted. So I was very careful to listen to people who
                    knew what they were talking about. They were very persuasive and very bright and
                    I went along with them. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. Our
                    experience with Mitchell-Ginsgela(?) was very good and the design turned out to
                    be superb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the board of architects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOW: This was the board the GSA set up. There were four or five who were voting
                    members, they were GSA people. I don't know whether there was an outside person.
                    But, they were all building experts. I was the only foreign affairs person. I
                    never regretted this decision. Once the firm was signed up by GSA, then they
                    showed me things they had done. The time frame was probably January, 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it take to make a decision on the
                        architectural design?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOW: I think it was two or three days. The firms had 30 days to come down, look
                    at the place, and develop their proposals. I think GSA gave each firm $50,000.
                    They each made presentations that took a day or two. It was a very serious
                    business.</p>
                <p>You know, this has nothing to do with the story I am telling, but something else
                    has come up that has the same kind of possibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Early last week we went to Annapolis and visited the Naval Institute to inquire
                    how they operate. And in the course of the visit, we were asking about the
                    museum. The Naval Institute houses a naval museum on the Annapolis campus. The
                    oral historian said the Congress required that each service designate one of its
                    museums to receive appropriate funds. He suggested that we ask the naval
                    historian about the requirement and funds. So, I called the naval historian and
                    he said he would fax the information over to me. It was a report of the
                    conference committee and it said they had a terrible time deciding who should
                    get funds. They decided that each service secretary should designate one of its
                    museums to receive appropriated funds for its construction. The others could get
                    appropriate funds for the exhibit but not for construction.</p>
                <p>I am taking this document up to Senator Pell in the next few days and demonstrate
                    there are 70 Army, 11 Navy and 30 or 40 Air Force museums. We don't have
                    anything that demonstrates the history of U.S. diplomacy. And then suggest that
                    perhaps he would like to be the patron saint for us. It is always a matter of
                    trying every way you can to find an opening to get through all this. And as you
                    said, if one keeps looking one can find enough support.</p>
