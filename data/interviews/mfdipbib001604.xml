                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an oral history interview with Dr. John Howard
                        Morrow, Professor Emeritus, Rutgers University. Dr. Morrow is a former
                        United States Ambassador to the Republic of Guinea. In fact, he was the
                        first ambassador to Guinea, having served in that capacity from 1959 to
                        1961. He has written much of those experiences in a work entitled, First
                        American Ambassador to Guinea, published by Rutgers University in 1968. This
                        interview is being sponsored by the Phelps-Stokes Fund as part of an oral
                        history project on Black Chiefs of Mission. The interview is the first in a
                        series. It is being held Monday, May 11, 1981 in New York City. Celestine
                        Tutt, interviewer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Morrow, could we begin by your telling us about the events which led to your
                    entry into the diplomatic service and of telling us about Guinea and how it
                    gained independence?</p>
                <p>MORROW: Thank you very much, Madame Tutt. It will be a pleasure. First, let me
                    observe that the impact and emergence of many African nations on the
                    international scene caused people throughout the world to take a second look at
                    the huge African continent which itself is shaped like a question mark. The
                    challenge of those who would understand Africa rests in its unpredictability.
                    The element of political unrest, uncertainty and surprise make it impossible to
                    look into a crystal ball and predict how it will all come out. Many African
                    leaders, thrust for the first time into positions of power and influence, have
                    been puzzled at times by what they considered to be complacency on the part of
                    the West. People from western countries have labeled Africans as truculent
                    because they have demanded insistently their rights and just and fair treatment
                    in all areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Now the severance of ties between the former West African - French West African
                    territory - Guinea and Metropolitan France in September 1958, not only gave
                    Guinea its independence but led to a cold war confrontation between East and the
                    West in the newly created Republic of Guinea. Irked by the bold, dramatic step
                    urged upon the Guinean people by Sekou Toure, charismatic Guinean labor leader,
                    President Charles de Gaulle of France withdrew from Guinea all French teachers,
                    technicians. and civil servants as well as all economic assistance. Eastern
                    European Communist bloc countries swiftly moved in with offers of barter trade
                    agreements and worked unstintingly to make Guinea not only a show place, but
                    also a strategic bridgehead for further operation in Africa. The nations of the
                    West, and particularly the United States, delayed recognition of the Guinean
                    Government. Even after the recognition, the Western powers waited before
                    offering economic and technical assistance so desperately needed by the
                    struggling African Republic. The United States did not recognize Guinea until
                    November 1958, and then waited until February 1959 before sending in a charg�
                    d'affaires, accompanied by a young, newly inducted Foreign Service officer, the
                    United States ambassador to Guinea until July 1959. Now I think this is a
                    logical point as any to answer the question: How did I become involved in
                    diplomacy and end up as a United States ambassador to, of all places, the
                    Republic of Guinea?</p>
                <p>Strangely enough, I can only conjecture about this. How would you feel if all out
                    of the clear you were to receive a phone call from Washington asking you to come
                    to the Department of State to meet with officials about a matter that is not
                    disclosed? That's what happened to me in April 1959, in Durham, North Carolina,
                    where at that time I was professor of French and chairman of the Department of
                    Foreign Languages at North Carolina College. The only conclusion I could draw at
                    that time was that the United States Information Service wanted to offer me a
                    post as a cultural affairs officer in some French-speaking country.</p>
                <p>What would have been your reaction if, during a conference in Washington with
                    Ambassador Loy Henderson, then in charge of administration at the Department of
                    State, and with Joseph Satterthwaite, Assistant Secretary of State for African
                    Affairs, the lead-off observation was: “Dr. Morrow, we probably know more about
                    you than you know about yourself. We have read everything you have written, and
                    we know about your contacts with African leaders and students, as well as with
                    French officials when you were in France last summer, 1958.” I thought, “What a
                    bunch of prime 'so and so's'!” Yes, I had been held up in Paris in the summer of
                    1958 and had been kept out of Algeria and French West Africa, which were still
                    under French rule because of a revolt among the French paratroopers in Algeria.
                    It happened that the French Army threatened revolt when it appeared that de
                    Gaulle, then recalled to power, might grant independence to Algeria.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Yes, I had talked with individuals, the individuals mentioned, plus Algerian
                    students and French citizens. I was collecting data for a book on the French
                    political situation in Africa, and since the French Government kept me out of
                    Africa, these talks were admittedly a very poor substitute. But what the hell
                    business was it of the United States Government what I did abroad as a private
                    citizen? It was at this point in the 1959 conference that it would reveal to me
                    that the State Department was very much interested in trying to get me to go to
                    the newly formed Republic of Guinea as a first American Ambassador. Guinea? Who
                    knew much about Guinea? A little bump on the hump of West Africa, an Atlantic
                    coastal state where it rained in some parts for six months and is dry for six
                    months. A country about the size of the state of Oregon bordered on the
                    northeast by the Republic of Mali and on the southeast by the Ivory Coast,
                    bordered on the northwest by what used to be Portuguese Guinea, now Guinea
                    Bissau, and the Republic of Senegal, bordered on the south by Sierra Leone and
                    Liberia; a country some of the citizens of which were among the friendliest in
                    all of Africa; a country in which young people were keenly interested in
                    receiving an education.</p>
                <p>He was a dynamic labor leader, Sekou Toure, president of Guinea since 1958, who
                    got his followers to vote “no” in the referendum sponsored by France in the
                    summer of 1958. Guinea thus achieved it's independence, but in retaliation, as
                    previously stated, General de Gaulle withdrew all economic aid — French
                    teachers, government functionaries and technicians. Officers were stripped of
                    all valuable equipment and in Eastern bloc Communist nations, to fill the vacuum
                    created by the departure of the French, Russia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
                    Germany established barter trade agreements to exchange consumer goods,
                    machinery, all sorts of things for Guinean bananas, pineapples, peanuts, palm
                    oil and so forth. What did the Western powers do in this crisis, one may ask?
                    They stood along the side lines and delayed recognition of this new Republic out
                    of deference, so the Guineans insisted, to France, a then NATO ally.</p>
                <p>The United Kingdom was the first Western power to recognize Guinea in October
                    1958; the Federal Republic of Germany followed suit shortly thereafter. The
                    United States recognized Guinea, November 1958, but waited, as we have
                    indicated, until February 1959 before sending in the charg� d'affaires and that
                    young, newly inducted Foreign officer to open an embassy in the Republic already
                    piqued because of the delay in official recognition. I wasn't sent over until
                    July 1959.</p>
                <p>Now in retrospect, it is difficult to understand how the United States, the
                    United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, and France could have been
                    caught by surprise by the vote passed by the people of Guinea in that September
                    constitutional referendum. For in the August 1958 confrontation between General
                    de Gaulle and Sekou Toure, which had taken place in Conakry during de Gaulle's
                    African trip in support of an affirmative referendum vote, Toure had made it
                    clear to de Gaulle that Guineans would prefer poverty in liberty to riches in
                    slavery.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>It was generally known that de Gaulle had left Guinea thoroughly dissatisfied
                    with the tone and implication of Toure's remarks. And then in September, just
                    eight days before the referendum, Toure had asserted publicly that Guinea would
                    be independent after September 29th. Nevertheless, the powers of the West
                    reacted almost with startled disbelief that any former French African territory
                    would take such a bold, costly and fateful step as to refuse to join the French
                    community. What is even more incredible is the painful slowness with which the
                    Western nations moved once the fact concerning the Guinean action became known.
                    The Guineans, irked by these delays, accused the West of holding back out of
                    deference to France, a NATO ally. It is true, also, however, that the Western
                    powers, and in particular the United States, were simply not prepared for the
                    dramatic action taken by the Guinean people under Sekou Toure.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Guinean Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency
                    Telli Diallo, had already been accredited to the United States Government in
                    Washington for four months and the Government of Guinea had become more and more
                    sensitive over the failure on the part of the United States to send a
                    representative with the rank of ambassador. The U.S. posture in Africa at that
                    moment was depicted ever so clearly in a report prepared under the capable
                    guidance of the late Dr. Melville Herskovitz of Northwestern University. “The
                    United States had never had a positive, dynamic policy in Africa,” said this
                    report. “Until very recently we have looked to continuing control by our
                    friendly European powers as a guarantee of stability and dependable cooperation
                    and have been reluctant to acknowledge the principle of self-government as fully
                    applicable to its people.”</p>
                <p>This I must admit was very definitely true prior to the Kennedy Administration,
                    and there are some who believe that this fast became true once again in 1967 and
                    1968. Russia, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, East Germany were not plagued in
                    1958 with any concern about what France might think about their establishing
                    relations with Guinea. Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, as well as the Soviet Union,
                    opened embassies in Conakry. East Germany set up a resident trade mission. The
                    barter agreements offered by these Communist countries were readily accepted by
                    the inexperienced and beleaguered Government of Guinea, that found itself
                    pressed to the wall by the unexpectedly severe action taken by the de Gaulle
                    government and by the initial unwillingness on the part of Western powers to
                    ensure economic and technical assistance. And when the bloc countries moved to
                    fill the vacuum created by the withdrawal of the French and the abrupt cessation
                    of French economic assistance, they were not making a leap into the void; they
                    fully expected to reap the benefits from their prompt action and ensure
                    friendship and solidarity. There was no question that they intended to make
                    Guinea their show place.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>In addition to a barter trade agreement, for example, Czechoslovakia made
                    available a supposedly unsolicited gift of small arms, light artillery and
                    armored cars. The international press reported that two ships, loaded with
                    Czechoslovakian arms and equipment, delivered their cargo to Guinea on March 24
                    and 27, respectively, in 1959, and along with the several thousand small arms,
                    the light artillery, and armored cars aboard the first vessel, there were
                    eighteen Czechoslovakian military advisors headed by a general. The second ship,
                    of Polish registry, brought additional Czechoslovakian arms and equipment. A
                    third ship, a Polish freighter, reached Guinea on April 17 with military and
                    farm equipment from Czechoslovakia. Just four months after the shipment of arms,
                    the Soviet Union offered the Republic of Guinea a thirty-five million dollar
                    line of credit. East Germany agreed to set up a supervised running of a huge
                    printing press in Conakry.</p>
                <p>The reports concerning the shipment of Czechoslovakian arms to Guinea aroused
                    concern, particularly among the Western powers. They were becoming more and more
                    perturbed by what appeared to be the deep bloc penetration of the struggling
                    African Republic.</p>
                <p>However, Guinean Ambassador Telli Diallo, a lawyer by training, charged at the
                    United Nations that colonial powers had sought to use Guinea's acceptance of a
                    gift of Czech arms to discredit the Guinean Government as anti-West. Then
                    President Sekou Toure chose this moment to reveal that he had appealed to
                    President Dwight Eisenhower for one or two thousand rifles before accepting the
                    arms gift from Czechoslovakia. Toure stated that the Guinean arms requested had
                    been made through President William V. S. Tubman of Liberia in November 1958,
                    before diplomatic relations had been established with the United States. Toure
                    declared that he had not received any answer to his request. But the United
                    States Department of State reported on April 30, 1959 that the government of
                    Guinea had not replied to suggestions concerning direct talks on the matter.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, during his official state visit to the United States in October
                    1959, President Toure stated emphatically, and no Washington official denied it,
                    that he had never received any answer to his request for arms. He asserted
                    further that the United States was the only country from which Guinea had
                    attempted to secure arms, and he regretted that this nation had found it
                    impossible to help his government in a moment of real crisis in the development
                    of the Republic of Guinea.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The dramatic, solitary stand taken by Sekou Toure and his political party
                    vis-a-vis France, struck a sympathetic cord in the hearts of Africans throughout
                    Africa. On that September day of the referendum, eighty-five percent of the
                    eligible voters in Guinea had gone to the polls. Ninety-six percent of these
                    eligible voters had voted “NO” and had thus ignored General de Gaulle's appeal
                    to come into the community. This move by Guinea to secure immediate independence
                    gave pause to many African leaders, who repeatedly in the past had uttered
                    high-sounding phrases concerning the necessity for independence. These leaders,
                    though talking and, in some instances, wishing for independence, did not believe
                    it to be wise to reject the French economic assistance which they knew to be
                    essential for raising their living standards. Unlike Sekou Toure, these African
                    makers of policy were unwilling to break with France at that time. They harbored
                    the belief that France was as interested in maintaining rapport with the African
                    republics as these republics were interested in receiving economic and technical
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>Toure was viewed with admiration, respect and even awe by the young people in
                    North Africa, as well as in sub-Saharan Africa, for he seemed to represent the
                    epitome of bold and fearless action in the face of overwhelming odds. And even
                    those individuals who questioned the wisdom of Toure's course of action, and
                    believed sincerely that it could only fail, grudgingly admitted that this young
                    African leader was not lacking in grit.</p>
                <p>The attention of nations both large and small became focused upon this leader of
                    the small West African Republic, and their officials discovered in their probe
                    how Toure had succeeded in getting his people to take a step which no other
                    French African leader had succeeded in getting his followers to take. These
                    officials discovered that Sekou Toure, a self-made man, was an extremely
                    intelligent leader, as well as an astute politician. Toure possessed charm,
                    dignity and poise, and fully aware of his limitations and educational training,
                    he surrounded himself with the few Guineans that had been trained in law,
                    pharmacy, medicine and administration. And through the years, the Guinean
                    populace had become accustomed to seeing Sekou Toure in positions of
                    responsibility and leadership; he had been Secretary General of the Postal and
                    Telecommunication Personnel Union, 1945; he was one of the founders and the vice
                    presidents of the important African political party, the Rassemblement
                    D�mocratique Africain, in 1946. He became Secretary General of the Guinean
                    branch of this political party, which was called Le Parti D�mocratique de
                    Guin�e, in 1952; and then went on to become Mayor of Conakry in 1955, and
                    Guinean deputy to the French National Assembly in 1956. He was elected head of
                    the African trade union that eventually claimed 700,000 members throughout
                    sub-Saharan Africa: Union G�n�rale des Travailleurs de Afrique Noire. And in May
                    of 1957, he became a member of the Grand Council of France, West Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Prior to the September referendum, Sekou Toure already had at his disposal a well
                    organized and smoothly functioning political party that had silenced virtually
                    all opposition in Guinea. He had had the sagacity to appeal to the women of
                    Guinea and to urge them to exercise their franchise. Toure openly insisted that
                    women should play a more important role, not only in Guinean affairs, but also
                    in the affairs of Africa. He supported the cause of monogamy in a Moslem
                    country. He pointed out the inadequate health services and urged that there
                    should be more building of dispensaries. He championed the cause of improved
                    education and urged the construction of additional schools. He opposed tribal
                    differences and a maintenance of village chiefs or headsmen. He considered the
                    chiefs the main bastion of the indigenous feudal system. He therefore convinced
                    the people of Guinea that they should elect their own leaders and do away with
                    the old practice of chieftaincy. And by June of 1958, Toure's party had scored
                    sweeping victories in local elections and had achieved real success in
                    decentralizing the administration of Guinea.</p>
                <p>This same machinery that had worked so well in giving Toure's party the
                    ascendancy in Guinea, despite resistance from the French administrators, was
                    used to get out the vote for the referendum. On the eve of the referendum, songs
                    composed in the dialects of Sousou, Malinke, Fula (Foulah), Kissi were sung
                    throughout Guinea, praising the exploits of Guinean heroes and lauding in
                    particular the courage of Sekou Toure, who was struggling to put the French out
                    of Guinea once and for all. Toure was compared to an elephant — syli — an animal
                    of great strength and one most difficult to handle when aroused. He was compared
                    also with Samori Toure, a fearless Guinean leader who had fought against French
                    occupation in the latter part of the nineteenth century. These songs were heard
                    constantly over the radio and were on the lips of even the smallest child out in
                    the brush. No American television or radio saturation for political candidates
                    was any more effective than this campaign in Guinea, where 90% of the people
                    were illiterate. Thus it was that this all-out campaign developed into an ebb
                    tide that swept through the ballot boxes of Guinea and changed this West African
                    nation from a status of a territory into that of an independent nation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Morrow, thank you. Given the United States' hesitation
                        or the delay in recognizing Guinea, how were you personally received in that
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Rightfully you should wonder how was I received in this country, caught
                    up in its newly won independence. I admit, frankly, that upon our arrival at the
                    airport in July 1959, the red carpet was certainly rolled out. On hand were the
                    Guinean army band, a detachment of troops, a color guard, numerous Guinean
                    officials and diplomatic representatives from Western countries. We rode in an
                    open car behind a motorcycle escort made up of ten smartly clad Guinean
                    policemen riding new Czechoslovakian motorcycles. And all along the eight-mile
                    route leading into the capital city, Conakry, Guineans rushed to the roadside to
                    applaud and to shout warm words of welcome: “Soyez le bienvenue, monsieur
                    1'ambassadeur des Etats Unis.” I shall never forget that warm welcome.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One couldn't be in Guinea very long, however, without discovering the malaise
                    that existed beneath the surface. Despite the warmth of this welcome on the part
                    of the people, I detected a decided anti-Western government sentiment among
                    Guinean government members. This sentiment was not directed toward me
                    personally. The Guineans had extreme doubts that the Western powers, and
                    particularly the United States, really intended to help their country, not to
                    speak of the rest of black Africa, progress economically, politically and
                    culturally.</p>
                <p>It is true also that the French who remained in Guinea, despite de Gaulle's
                    orders to withdraw, were very anti-American. Unlike the Guineans, they feared an
                    American take-over. And let's not forget the rumors concerning my second-class
                    citizenship and the whispers about the U.S. effrontery in sending a black dupe
                    of American capitalism to deceive naive Guineans. These rumors originated in
                    America and were helped along by the French, Russian and Eastern European
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>It cannot be denied that a June 2, 1959 editorial that appeared in the Washington
                    Post prior to my departure from America had talked about the element of
                    condescension in sending a Negro ambassador to an African republic. The
                    editorial concluded with the observation that the deep Communist bloc
                    penetration called for an experienced and skillful career diplomat. To the
                    credit of the Guinean Government, this matter was disposed of by revealing that
                    all racism was ruled out even in its constitution. The Guinean Government
                    declared that it had no interest in a person's color but only in an individual's
                    merit and willingness to respect Guinean sovereignty. In a final analysis,
                    Guinea had requested the State Department to send an educator and not a career
                    diplomat, for it was felt that an educator would have greater sympathy for and
                    understanding of the problems and aspirations of a developing country.</p>
                <p>I admit very frankly that my role in Guinea was not that of a cookie-pusher or
                    glorified paper shopper. The bloc countries were working overtime to make this
                    new African republic their show place. It was not just a question of competing
                    with Communist and other Western diplomats to win the confidence of the Guinean
                    Government. I found it just as difficult to convince Washington officials that
                    President Sekou Toure was a genuine African nationalist struggling to preserve
                    Guinean independence as it was at first to convince Guinean officials that the
                    United States did want to help developing nations preserve their
                    sovereignty.</p>
                <p>It was the additional challenge of winning the respect, confidence, yes, and
                    loyalty of the white Americans on the American Embassy staff in Guinea, some of
                    whom were still influenced and guided by the stereotypes of their youth
                    concerning the question of race. To make the odds even more interesting, I
                    didn't have at my disposal, as did the Russian Ambassador, a thirty-five million
                    dollar line of credit with Guinea. Nor did I have a twenty-five million dollar
                    interest-free loan as did the Chinese Communist Ambassador. I could not lay
                    claim to supplying small arms at a time of need, as could the Czechoslovakian
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>However, a rapid assessment of my tour of duty in Guinea would reveal, among
                    other things, that forty-two Guinean students came to America to study, the
                    first of some one hundred and fifty selected for studying in colleges and
                    universities in America. Operation Crossroads, a privately sponsored summer work
                    program involving American college students, the forerunner of the Peace Corps,
                    was admitted to Guinea. Eighteen American teachers worked directly for the
                    Guinean Government; thirteen Americans participated in an English-teaching
                    project under the joint supervision of the International Cooperation
                    Administration and the United States Information Service; an American cultural
                    center was opened in Conakry and remained open during my tour of duty; nine
                    Guinean Government officials, in addition to the six who had accompanied
                    President Toure and his wife on the first official state visit to the United
                    States in October 1959, visited America. An economic and technical bilateral
                    agreement was signed on behalf of Guinea and America by the Ministry of Plan and
                    myself, in Conakry, on September 30, 1960. United States planes, in August 1960,
                    flying under the flag of the United Nations, transported Guinean soldiers to the
                    Congo to join the United Nations force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
                    during the uprising there. Ships from the United States South Atlantic Fleet
                    twice made goodwill visits to Conakry, December of 1960, February 1961, and were
                    welcomed by the Guinean Government. My family and I had been warmly received not
                    only in the cities but also the villages of Guinea.</p>
                <p>Now these accomplishments seem very meager today, but please remember that they
                    were achieved despite the barter trade agreement, despite the presence in the
                    Guinean capital of diplomatic representatives from most of the Communist bloc
                    countries including North Vietnam and Outer Mongolia, and despite the fact that
                    the United States had yet to implement the economic and bilateral agreement
                    signed in September 1960. During the period that had followed Guinean
                    independence, the Communist bloc countries and the Western powers failed
                    repeatedly to take seriously Guinea's foreign policy, which was based upon
                    positive neutrality. The Communist countries regarded the Guinean policy as a
                    facade that covered up favorable leanings toward the East. The Western powers
                    interpreted the Guinean policy as meaning neutrality in favor of the East.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, the Guinean flirtation with the Communist bloc countries carried
                    it almost to the brink. That it did not become a bloc satellite may be
                    attributed partly to Toure's expertise and brinkmanship, partly to mistakes by
                    bloc representatives. If the Russians had not had such disdain for Guinean
                    intelligence, they might have had Guinea with its seaport and airport as a base
                    of operation for further African conquest. But the Russians became impatient and
                    imperious and tried to drive too hard a bargain too quickly. They and their bloc
                    colleagues failed to hire a single Guinean either in their chancelleries or
                    residences. The Guineans took this for distrust. Furthermore, employment was
                    badly needed. The materiel supplied by the Communist countries did not come up
                    to expectation. The abandoned jeeps, trucks, buses, discarded for lack of spare
                    parts, provided stark testimony of the weakness of certain aspects of barter
                    trade agreements.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The abrupt and enforced departure of the Soviet Ambassador from Guinea, seven
                    months after my arrival in Paris, on a new assignment in 1961, brought to an
                    unceremonious close, for the moment, the honeymoon between Guinea and the Soviet
                    Union. An aborted revolt in this African republic had revealed the extent of
                    Soviet activities among Guinean youth organizations. President Toure's
                    insistence on the recall of the Soviet Ambassador caused both the West and the
                    East to take a new look at Toure's oft-repeated policy of positive
                    neutrality.</p>
                <p>It concerned me greatly at one point to learn, during an alleged American and
                    Russian intervention in Angola, for example, that Russian vessels were reported
                    to be departing from Guinea carrying Cuban missionaries to Angola. In the first
                    place, this seemed to indicate that relations had been patched up between Russia
                    and Guinea. Furthermore, it recalled my efforts, repeated efforts in fact, to
                    convince Washington officials between 1959 and 1961 that Russia would one day
                    take advantage of Guinea's airfield and seaport.</p>
                <p>There's another matter that troubles me because it reveals how clearly disguised
                    censorship can prevent the truth from being disclosed. In the February 23, 1974
                    edition of the Saturday Review World, there appeared an article by Russell
                    Warren Howe entitled, Black But Not African. One paragraph in Howe's article
                    contained at least three untrue statements about the situation in Guinea between
                    1959 and 1961. Although I sent a rebuttal to Norman Cousins, the editor of
                    Saturday Review, my reply to Howe's article was never printed. Here's the
                    paragraph in question.</p>
                <p>“Ten years earlier when President Eisenhower sent Professor Morrow, a black, to
                    be America's first American Ambassador to Guinea, President Toure refused to
                    deal with Morrow. He saw in Morrow's appointment an insult concocted to appease
                    de Gaulle, who had opposed Guinean independence. And when a black USIS Officer
                    was appointed, Toure closed the USIS library. But when Morrow was replaced by a
                    white journalist, William Attwood, Toure swamped him with hospitality.”</p>
                <p>Strangely enough, Howe, who characterized himself as a longtime observer in
                    African affairs, never came to Guinea while I was there and thus was not in a
                    position to make a first-hand or honest assessment of the Guinean situation. On
                    the other hand, noted New York Times journalists such as Homer Bigget,
                    Pulitzer-Prize winner Henry Tanner, the late Tom Brady, men known for
                    intelligence, objectivity, and veracity, did make it a point to get into Guinea
                    to learn of the complexity of the Guinean scene. It is not true that President
                    Toure refused to deal with me; that my appointment termed by Howe an insult was
                    contrived to appease de Gaulle; that the appointment of a black USIS Officer
                    caused the closing of the USIS library.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Had Toure refused to accept my agr�ment, I could never have set foot in his
                    country. Had my presence in Guinea later become a source of annoyance to Toure
                    or his government, I would have been put out of Guinea as a persona non grata
                    just as the Russian Ambassador was put out in 1961. How ridiculous to assert
                    that my appointment was concocted to appease de Gaulle. De Gaulle detested
                    Toure, the person who had insulted him publicly during his official visit to
                    Guinea in 1958 by calling for Guinean independence from France. De Gaulle was
                    certainly not appeased by the appointment of a black American acceptable to
                    President Toure. It's a matter of record that the USIS library was never closed
                    once it had been officially opened during my tour of duty. The Guinean
                    Government officials were suspicious of the purpose of the USIS because the word
                    “information” connotes the gathering of intelligence. My job was to convince
                    these officials that the United States Information Service was not a branch of
                    the CIA. And, incidentally, the head of the USIS staff in Conakry was white, as
                    was his assistant. Only later was the staff augmented by a black American male
                    and an African woman from Sierra Leone. A racially-integrated team was attached
                    on a temporary basis to teach English. And this group was replaced by a
                    permanent black American English teacher.</p>
                <p>I will be the first to admit that any American policy geared to send black
                    diplomats exclusively to Africa would not only be discriminatory and
                    denigrating, it would be disastrous both for America and the African nations
                    involved. A black skin carried no assurance either of automatic acceptance or
                    success on the African scene. It follows also that a white skin is not
                    necessarily the passport to diplomatic victory in Africa. The truth is that if
                    the individual lacks sensitivity, judgment, patience, common sense, human
                    compassion and an excellent knowledge of the official language, the culture and
                    civilization, color will be of absolutely no help. There are black and white
                    persons in the diplomatic service as well as on the outside who are eminently
                    qualified to serve the United States anywhere in the world. But enough of
                    this.</p>
                <p>I firmly believe that if the French had been more tactful, had shown more common
                    sense and less pique in handling the severance of relations with Guinea, the
                    situation might have been quite different. The French language was undoubtedly a
                    unifying factor in a country with so many African dialects. The French had been
                    most skillful in spreading a culture, civilization and language. But de Gaulle,
                    angered at Guinea's failure to become a part of the new French community, did
                    all that he could to make the Guinean experiment fail. It was indeed frustrating
                    for me to witness the care taken by Washington officials not to offend de Gaulle
                    by American activities in Guinea. But when I think of the shaky relationship
                    that came to exist between France and America, there's little need for me to
                    express my disdain for the vain efforts to appease the French leader between
                    1959 and 1961. It seems to me that United States policy toward a nation such as
                    Guinea should not be determined by our efforts to obtain the good grace of such
                    nations or our desires not to offend NATO allies, but by our adherence to a
                    coherent and dynamic policy developed along the line of United States
                    responsibilities and interests as a world power toward developing nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I am not advocating the deliberate ignoring of the views of our allies, but I
                    submit that we must be prepared to ignore these views when they conflict with
                    our inherent obligations toward developing nations. We cannot blow hot and cold
                    in Africa and still expect for our policy to have credibility in that continent.
                    And we must stop paying lip service to self-determination for nations and in the
                    development of states that are politically independent and economically viable.
                    We must stop giving African nations the impression that our interest in them is
                    determined solely by cold war consideration. We must avoid the appearance of
                    ignoring those nations which are consistently friendly and rewarding those that
                    flaunt things for which we stand. We must convince African nations that our
                    African policy is a coherent one and not something made up from day to day, as
                    we move from one crisis to another.</p>
                <p>These things we can learn from diplomacy, African style. And the presence of
                    Africans in the United Nations and the United States in ever increasing numbers
                    — students and diplomats, business and trainees and visitors and so forth — is
                    most important in improving the lines of communication and in exploding myths
                    about Africa and the United States. And though the general American public may
                    still remain ill-informed about the real significance of Africa on the
                    international scene, it is true also that there are thousands of Americans today
                    who are knowledgeable about Africa and Africans, and this body of informed and
                    interested people must exert every effort to convince our government that it has
                    a part to play in helping these nations preserve their sovereignty and
                    viability. Africans returning to their homeland must strive to convey to their
                    compatriots the sincere interest and concern of Americans who truly want African
                    states to attain their rightful place on the international scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Morrow, your book, First American Ambassador to
                        Guinea, published by Rutgers University Press in 1968, gives a very detailed
                        picture of your tour of duty in Guinea. I wonder if you would please tell us
                        about some of the significant events that you talk about in this book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: All right, thank you very much.</p>
                <p>First, let's say life was never dull in Guinea, whether I was engaged in averting
                    a break in diplomatic relations or supervising the airlift of Guinean soldiers
                    on U.S. planes down to the Congo, or representing the United States at
                    independence celebrations at newly emerging African nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>For example, one evening my neighbor, Ambassador Herbert Schroeder, called on me
                    at the official residence prior to his return to Bonn where he had been summoned
                    by his government. It was in early March of 1960 and the report was spreading
                    throughout world capitals that the Republic of Guinea had become the first
                    African nation to recognize the German Democratic Republic, which was East
                    Germany. This report was. supposedly based on pictures that had been made in
                    East Germany reportedly showing the Guinean Ambassador to Moscow presenting his
                    credentials to the East German President. The Government of the Federal Republic
                    of Germany — West Germany — had been adhering to the Holstein Doctrine according
                    to which it would sever diplomatic relations with any nation that recognized the
                    government of Communist East Germany. The calling home of Ambassador Schroeder
                    on the heels of the news linking Guinea and East Germany seemed to be the first
                    step in a break between West Germany and Guinea.</p>
                <p>Despite the fact that no aid agreement existed between the United States and
                    Guinea in March of 1960, it was generally accepted among the Western and Eastern
                    members of the diplomatic corps in Guinea that I had successfully established
                    strong personal rapport with President Toure and the members of his government.
                    It was therefore not unusual for Ambassador Schroeder to seek my views in a
                    moment of crisis. In addition, Ambassador Schroeder and I had established very
                    friendly relations and often took our daily swim in the ocean to talk over
                    mutual problems. I told the Ambassador that nobody could advise him on a course
                    of action and that he undoubtedly would not only have to make his decision by
                    the time of his arrival in Bonn. However, if I were in his place, I would,
                    before leaving Conakry, send a message to my government recommending that it
                    investigate the incident carefully before taking any action as drastic as
                    severing diplomatic relations with Guinea.</p>
                <p>I pointed out to the Ambassador that his country was the only Western power doing
                    anything tangible toward making Guinea viable and it would be a tremendous blow
                    to have this assistance cut off. I reminded him that the Guinean Government had
                    resisted the efforts of the East German Trade Mission in Conakry to establish an
                    embassy and I thought it significant that this report of the establishment of
                    diplomatic ties between Guinea and East Germany had come at a time when
                    President Toure was away from Conakry visiting his constituents in the brush. I
                    assured the West German Ambassador that I would call unofficially on the Guinean
                    Government to urge that every possible step be made to clear up this
                    misunderstanding. Until I was presented with specific proof that Guinea had
                    taken the action claimed by the West Germans, I intended to act as if the report
                    were not true. We agreed, of course, that if Guinea actually had recognized East
                    Germany, nothing could avert a break between his country and Guinea.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>To keep my promise to Ambassador Schroeder, I called the next day on the Acting
                    President, Abdourahmane Diallo, Minister of State, who happened also to be one
                    of my neighbors in Donka. Diallo, never without his pipe, received me at the
                    Pr�sidence and we immediately got to the matter at hand. I told him that I was
                    there unofficially as a friend of the “court” and I wished to stress the
                    seriousness of the situation confronting Guinea in its relationship with the
                    Federal Republic of Germany. I said that it would probably be the responsibility
                    of the Guinean Government to take the initiative to establish beyond the shadow
                    of a doubt what a diplomatic representative was doing in East Germany, if he had
                    been there at all. Guinea must do this if it wished the community of nations to
                    continue to believe its professed policy of positive neutralism and its affirmed
                    belief in self-determination.</p>
                <p>Acting President Diallo thanked me for my interest and said that, to the best of
                    his knowledge, the Republic of Guinea had not recognized the East German
                    Government. He admitted that the East German representative of the Trade Mission
                    in Conakry had made repeated efforts to get the Mission raised to the status of
                    an embassy, but the Guinean Government had refused. The Acting President said
                    that he did not have the full details of the Guinean Ambassador's visit to East
                    Germany, but he felt that it had nothing to do with the establishment of
                    diplomatic relations. He assured me that word would be sent to President Toure
                    to return to Conakry and that the matter would be taken up with the President
                    the moment he returned.</p>
                <p>I expected that there would be an increasing sentiment among certain government
                    agencies of Washington to press for a break in diplomatic relations between the
                    United States and Guinea in order to present a united front with West Germany
                    and to chastise Guinea for its failure to adhere to a policy of “positive
                    neutralism”. I felt that such an action on the part of the United States would
                    strike a fatal blow to American influence in Africa. West Germany itself had not
                    formally broken ties with Guinea; it had merely called home its ambassador for
                    consultation. If the matter were settled in a satisfactory fashion between West
                    Germany and Guinea, the United States, once it had broken, would find itself in
                    an untenable position. Only as a last resort should a major world power break
                    relations with a struggling developing nation that has yet to acquire skill and
                    sophistication in things diplomatic.</p>
                <p>I planned and launched a campaign to combat any attempt to initiate a break
                    between Guinea and the United States. After a week went by and the Federal
                    Republic of Germany had yet to report that it was going to break with Guinea, I
                    began to feel slightly more at ease. President Toure returned to the capital,
                    finally yielding to the insistence of the West German Government, and answered
                    several specific questions concerning relations between the Republic of Guinea
                    and the East German Communist regime. President Toure authorized his Minister of
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform me that his answers to these questions
                    were to be hand-carried to Paris, where they would be delivered to the West
                    German Government by the Guinean Ambassador to France — Naby Youlah.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>In the final stage of negotiations between Guinea and West Germany, West German
                    officials came to Guinea during the first week of April 1960 and traveled to
                    Kankan in upper Guinea to have talks with President Toure who was presiding over
                    the national conference of the Parti D�mocratique de Guin�e. And shortly after
                    these discussions, it became known officially that East Germany was not opening
                    an embassy in Conakry and that there was not going to be a break between West
                    Germany and Guinea. Before Ambassador Telli Diallo returned to Guinea, his
                    government had requested the State Department in Washington to convey to me its
                    warm thanks for the very helpful role I had played during the period of crisis
                    between Bonn and Conakry. Upon the return of Ambassador Schroeder to Guinea from
                    West Germany, his first official act after his protocol visit to the Guinean
                    Government and Ministry of Foreign Affairs was to come to my office in Conakry
                    to express, in person, the thanks of his government for my good services. This
                    is one of the few moments during my stay in Guinea when I felt that my efforts
                    had not been in vain.</p>
                <p>My first confrontation with the Guinean Government concerning an American citizen
                    came during the first part of August 1959. This incident provided valuable
                    insight into the inclination on the part of Guinean ministers to do business
                    only with the head man of an embassy. They were influenced in this respect by
                    their own experiences in running their ministries.</p>
                <p>Miss Joan Gillespie, a young American woman, arrived in Conakry to write articles
                    on Africa for the New York Times and several American periodicals. Miss
                    Gillespie had received her Ph.D. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy
                    and served two years as a Foreign Service officer. She had written a book on the
                    Algerian Liberation Movement. She had been drawn to Guinea by many conflicting
                    reports on the Guinean experience in independence. Miss Gillespie called on me
                    at the chancellery and let me know that she hoped to travel into the interior of
                    Guinea to gather data for news articles. I told her that travel for civilians
                    was still somewhat restricted and she would have to get permission from the
                    Minister of the Interior, Fodeba Keita. The Embassy was ready to help, if
                    possible, but the Guinean Government had been most unhappy over some of the
                    articles about their country which had appeared in American periodicals and
                    newspapers.</p>
                <p>Two days after Miss Gillespie's visit to the chancellery, a call was received
                    from the Ministry of Interior. Minister Keita wished to see me immediately. I
                    sent word that the Minister could come right over. Another call came saying that
                    the Minister would appreciate it if I would stop by and see him as he was
                    expecting several important phone calls that morning. When I arrived, I found
                    Minister Keita, who was usually quite relaxed and jovial, pacing back and forth
                    in his office. He reported that an American journalist had attempted to file a
                    story reflecting seriously on the Guinean national honor. He called me because
                    he wanted me to ask this person to leave Guinea. I asked the Minister what the
                    journalist had said in the story, and he replied that she had been writing about
                    a matter that concerned only Guinea and another African nation.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The phone rang at that moment and a spirited conversation in Sousou dialect
                    ensued, after which the Minister turned and, explained: “That woman journalist
                    has just attempted to file a second story.” He said a Ghanaian in difficulty
                    with the Ghanaian authorities had been arrested at the airport in Conakry when
                    he attempted to enter Guinea. The American reporter had witnessed the arrest,
                    and when she discovered that the Ghanaian was still in jail twenty-four hours
                    later, with no charges against him, she began to question police officials. Not
                    receiving an answer satisfactory to her, she sent off a dispatch to New York
                    about the seizure at the airport. And in her second wire she was questioning
                    Guinean procedures for arrest and holding prisoners. She made comparisons
                    between the Guinean police methods and those employed behind the Iron
                    Curtain.</p>
                <p>I explained to the Minister the American concept of freedom of speech and freedom
                    of the press and said that his description of the journalist's activities
                    suggested that she was performing the usual duties of her profession without in
                    any way encroaching upon Guinean sovereignty. I told him that I could not ask a
                    journalist to leave Guinea. In fact, one of my duties as Ambassador was to see
                    to it that American citizens received full protection under the law of the
                    land.</p>
                <p>Miss Gillespie was not asked to leave Guinea either by the Guinean authorities or
                    by me, but she was not given permission to go into the interior. After a week in
                    Conakry, she left for North Africa and all of us were very greatly shocked when
                    we learned some months later that, seven weeks after her arrival at Tunisia, she
                    had died following a brief illness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything suspicious about the illness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: No, I think it had something to do with her kidneys and her liver. That
                    was a question which was raised immediately because I don't know whether it was
                    at this time or not, but a chap by the name of F�lix Moumi�, who had been one of
                    the so-called leaders in the Cameroons and reputedly was also involved in
                    smuggling bombs and so on, was actually poisoned in Belgium by drinking a
                    poisoned drink; so people were raising questions. But it was finally decided
                    that actually she had died from natural causes. I got a very nice letter from
                    her parents thanking me for having assisted her while she was in Guinea, which
                    came also as quite a shock.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I want to say a word about what was called “le complot” or plot. A mere handful
                    of those accused in May of 1960 of plotting to overthrow the Government of
                    Guinea were former soldiers. Among the civilians condemned to death were a
                    brilliant young Guinean lawyer, Ibrahima Diallo, and a religious leader, El-Hadj
                    Mohammed, was from Conakry. In his May Day address President Toure revealed to
                    the populace and diplomatic corps that a plot against his government had been
                    discovered, and arms found at various points along the frontier between Guinea
                    and Senegal. And the Ivory Coast also was included in this. Well, in a frenzied
                    speech, Toure excoriated the saboteurs and asserted that the guilty would be
                    caught and given the ultimate punishment.</p>
                <p>Several days later, Toure summoned the diplomatic corps to the National Assembly
                    Chamber and gave us a lengthy explanation of the crisis facing his government.
                    He told us that the suspects would not be tried in the traditional courts of
                    Guinea but would face a popular tribunal consisting of the members of the
                    National Political Bureau; the deputies of the National Assembly; the members of
                    the National Council of the Guinean Labor Union; the members of the National
                    Council of Youth Organizations; and the Secretaries General of the three sectors
                    of Conakry.</p>
                <p>When I heard about the size of this popular tribunal and thought about the
                    provocative nature of the radio broadcast and the public statements already
                    uttered by Sekou Toure himself, I wondered just how much chance there was for a
                    prisoner to receive a fair trial.</p>
                <p>On May 4, 1960, we learned that a special committee appointed by an extraordinary
                    party conference was to draw a dossier of the accused, and the accused were to
                    be confronted by their accusers. On May 8th, the members of the popular tribunal
                    met at 6:00 p.m. to hear the result of the special committee's investigation and
                    reach a verdict.</p>
                <p>Two days later the verdict was announced. It was not possible at any time between
                    May 4th and May 8th to discover whether the prisoners were defended by lawyers
                    or given the opportunity to appeal the verdict. All that the public knew was
                    that eighteen people were condemned to death, seven in absentia, one of whom, a
                    Frenchman, had escaped in a private plane. A French druggist was sentenced to
                    twenty years of hard labor and he was released later on in 1961. A Swiss
                    national received a sentence of fifteen years at hard labor. He also was
                    released in 1961. Twenty-one Guineans were sentenced to five years at hard labor
                    and all those who had been convicted had their property confiscated.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The diplomatic corps and the Guinean populace were very surprised to learn that
                    Attorney Ibrahima Diallo and El-Hadj Mohammed Lamine Kaba had been accused of
                    being agents working for a foreign power and sentenced to death. I did not know
                    the religious leader, but I was acquainted with Diallo. I found it difficult to
                    believe that he was in the employ of a foreign power. I did know that he was
                    dissatisfied with the one-party system in Guinea and had openly discussed the
                    possibility of organizing a second political party. He'd made no effort to cover
                    his dissent and he even discussed it at the April 1960 meeting of the party at
                    Kaulsan. Diallo was intelligent and alert. Had he been working for a foreign
                    power, he would have been clever enough to keep this hidden from his colleague.
                    And I was aware that the religious leader, El-Hadj, had expressed his
                    dissatisfaction with the Guinean officials and had accused these officials of
                    doing nothing for the masses but merely looking out for their selfish interests.
                    The unfortunate part about this alleged coup is the fact that no outsiders were
                    admitted to the trials or had had access to the supposed evidence. It was never
                    possible to determine whether the accused had been properly represented by
                    counsel or given the opportunity to appeal the verdict. No announcement was ever
                    made as to when, where or how death penalties were carried out. Nothing was ever
                    done to refute the charges that the accused had been subjected to inhuman
                    torture to induce confessions. Even in Algeria the Ben Bella government saw fit
                    to announce when and how it executed those who plotted against the state.
                    Perhaps in Guinea that secrecy had been necessary in order to avoid a tribal
                    outbreak. However, this very secrecy gave rise to grave misgivings about the
                    guilt of the accused.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anything happen to the families of those men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: In the case of the families, Diallo was married to a white French woman
                    and I think she was finally allowed to leave the country. I'm not aware of what
                    happened in connection with the family of El-Hadj Kaba, but I do know that there
                    were a number of disillusioned people in the diplomatic corps at the manner in
                    which these people were, should we say, done in. And the feeling was that it had
                    not been a fair trial and there was a question of the fact that somebody had
                    openly dissented against the party and that this could not be countenanced at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other instances of that kind? Was that the
                        first major incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MORROW: Well, the major incident, for example, the second attempted coup, which I
                    think that I've already given indication, the major source of disturbance this
                    time was among the youth and the teachers and at that point this is when it was
                    felt that the Soviet Ambassador had been involved in getting too close to the
                    youth group and so on, and he was asked to leave. And when I learned of the
                    Soviet Ambassador's departure, I thought about the numerous times I had warned
                    my Guinean counterpart and several of his colleagues certainly, and that
                    President Toure and his government would remain strong enough to withstand
                    Communist infiltration tactics and might well prove to be their undoing. Always
                    they scoffed at the idea and called to my attention that the nearest Russian
                    troops were thousands of miles away. Now, they implied that I was not thinking
                    about troops so much as about what would happen to Guinea if their youth
                    organization, women's groups, Democratic Party in Guinea, and various ministries
                    were successfully infiltrated. This could mean that one day they would wake up
                    and discover that they had to seek jobs elsewhere, but of course, this is
                    actually what happened in the case of the revolt of the youth, and the Soviet
                    Ambassador was put out. I never did find out what they did to the youths.</p>
                <p>Before I'm through, however, I wish to give a footnote of what happened after I
                    left Guinea in connection with some of the members and ministers who were
                    literally done in. I shall produce a letter later that I would like to put in as
                    a footnote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: I think a word about that operation airlift in the Congo would be
                    appropriate at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Proceed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: In the latter part of August 1960, I was informed that American planes
                    flying under the flag of the United Nations were going to arrive in Guinea
                    within the next twenty-four hours to begin the airlift of troops to the Congo. I
                    did not feel that this information presented any immediate problem to our
                    Embassy since the operation was to be under the supervision of the United
                    Nations' mission in Conakry assigned to aid the Guinean Government, for example,
                    to develop administrative cadres. Naturally, I personally would cooperate in
                    every possible way, but this was the United Nations' operation. The United
                    States and other powers had merely offered to help in the form of
                    transportation, communications and supplies.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The United Nations' mission in Conakry received word that a U.S. Air Force
                    officer in charge of the logistics of the airlift, was to arrive on a plane
                    coming from the American air base in Ch�teauroux, France. Merely as a courtesy
                    gesture, I was at hand at the airport to greet the officer when he arrived
                    several hours later in a huge C-119 transport plane. Major Behrens had expected
                    to load the plane immediately with soldiers and supplies, but discovered that
                    the first contingent from the interior had not arrived in the airport. A hasty
                    consultation had brought the decision to postpone the departure for the next
                    day. The next morning Guinean troops were assembled in the center of Conakry
                    near the political party headquarters. President Toure made a brief speech
                    urging the troops to comport themselves as brave men and to fight to liberate
                    their African brothers in the Congo. He then asked Major Behrens to stand at his
                    side as the troops passed in review and marched to the buses and trucks waiting
                    to carry them to the airport. The members of the Guinean Government then hurried
                    to the airport to see the take-off.</p>
                <p>The President and his Ministers were becoming somewhat impatient when the C-119
                    didn't take off immediately, but finally the soldiers assigned to take off with
                    the first contingent were aboard. I had been standing near the C-119 watching
                    the loading operation when suddenly I heard my name called. I turned around to
                    see the Embassy political officer, John Cunningham, hurrying across the tarmac
                    in the morning heat and Pat Cunningham — we called him Pat — was perspiring
                    heavily by the time he reached me. I could see that he was very much troubled.
                    In his hand were two telegrams, and when he handed them to me he said softly,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, here are two more problems for your attention.”</p>
                <p>The telegrams had not been sent to me but were directed to Major Behrens and the
                    captain of the C-119 and they had been sent in my care from Ch�teauroux through
                    commercial channels, which meant that anybody in the downtown telegraph office
                    in Conakry who could read English, already had had access to their content. The
                    stark, succinct messages typed on those yellow slips of paper indicated that the
                    airlift had been suspended and that the captain of the C-119 was ordered to
                    return immediately to the airbase in Ch�teauroux.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The airlift was cancelled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Yes. Cancelled! Cunningham, at this point seeing the airlift was
                    cancelled, stood by in silence as I glanced hurriedly at the dismaying messages.
                    Without a word to him I placed the telegrams quickly in my inside coat pocket,
                    walked over to the Major and Captain and said, “Come on men, let's get this
                    blooming plane out of here before Thanksgiving day finds us still trying to get
                    to the Congo.” My tone was quiet; I was not smiling. The Captain saluted
                    smartly, thanked us for our hospitality, climbed into the plane and started the
                    engines. He taxied the huge plane off the tarmac toward the airstrip as a
                    military band struck up the Guinean national anthem.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The members of the Government were waving goodbye, and after a brief warm-up, the
                    C-119 started down the runway with its very heavy load. As it approached the end
                    of the runway, it still was not airborne. At that moment the terrible thought
                    passed through my mind that possibly the runway was not long enough for a plane
                    so heavily laden to get off the ground in the heat of the day. Seemingly with
                    inches to spare, the plane with its precious cargo lifted off the ground,
                    wavered for just a moment, and rose toward the noonday sun. As the plane
                    disappeared in the distance, I turned to the Major and said, “Major, I've just
                    done something which is probably going to cause all hell to break loose, but I
                    want you to know that I stand ready to accept the sole responsibility for my
                    act.”</p>
                <p>The Major was clearly surprised with what I had said, but he waited with quiet
                    interest for what was to follow. “Did you see the two messages which FSO
                    (foreign service officer) Cunningham delivered to me a short while ago? What I
                    mean to say is, did you see him hand me two yellow slips of paper?”</p>
                <p>“As a matter of fact I did, Mr. Ambassador, and I was wondering whether or not
                    something important had come up about our air operation.” “The truth is that
                    something very important has come up which is going to complicate life for us
                    here in Guinea for the next forty-eight hours or so.”</p>
                <p>I gave him the two telegrams which he proceeded to study carefully. It was not
                    until after I saw a faint trace of a smile beginning to form on the Major's
                    features that I began to feel a little more hopeful about the whole
                    business.</p>
                <p>“Major,” I continued, “I had to withhold those messages from you and the Air
                    Force captain, for once you had seen them, you would have had to comply. I'm
                    sure that you can understand that I would rather have faced a firing squad than
                    to have been forced to go up to the airport balcony and tell President Toure,
                    the Defense Minister and their colleagues that the airlift was off. What
                    explanation could I have offered?”</p>
                <p>“You were confronted with a tough decision, Mr. Ambassador, and you undoubtedly
                    made it on the basis of your knowledge of the situation here.”</p>
                <p>“Can you imagine yourself, Major, going into that plane to tell those soldiers to
                    get off the plane, unload the supplies, ammunition and await orders to return to
                    their encampment? How do you suppose they would have reacted, especially those
                    who obviously are none too military? What would have been the reaction of that
                    huge crowd of Guineans massed around the airport to see the triumphal departure
                    of their first contingent of troops ever to leave the Republic of Guinea?”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>After reiterating that I was accepting full responsibility for withholding the
                    two official messages and stood ready to be recalled for so doing, I went on to
                    explain that I had no alternative. It was my feeling that if the orders had been
                    carried out as directed, the United Nations, as well as the United States, would
                    have been in a position not only delicate but untenable. I said there had
                    already been enough problems concerning Guinean troops going to the Congo
                    without the United States taking any unilateral action that could be interpreted
                    as blocking their passage. I requested the Major's assistance in demanding the
                    reason why the airlift was being called off and in urging that the operation not
                    be suspended but carried out in keeping with the U.S. pledge to the United
                    Nations.</p>
                <p>The Major consented to help. We sent messages to Washington, Ch�teauroux, France,
                    and had the local UN mission send one to New York insisting on an explanation
                    for the cancellation of the airlift, and stressing the necessity of keeping the
                    promise to transport Guinean troops to the Congo. Then began one of the most
                    tedious waits of my stay in Guinea.</p>
                <p>The Guinean Government had been informed that the schedule for the arrival of the
                    next plane was somewhat uncertain, but word was supposed to come confirming the
                    arrival time. At 8:00 p.m. the same day, the telephone rang at the residence and
                    I recognized the voice of Minister Fodeba Keita. He asked me when the airlift
                    was to recommence. I reminded him that this was actually an operation by the
                    United Nations and I did not know exactly when the next plane would reach
                    Conakry. The Minister informed me that if no American planes had arrived by the
                    next day, the Government would have to seek its own mode of transportation to
                    the Congo. These words brought to my mind the picture of IL-18's, with
                    Czechoslovakian pilots coming in from Accra to pick up the stranded Guinean
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>I did not sleep well that night and found no difficulty in getting up at 4:30
                    a.m. when a ringing telephone added its noise to the heavy rainfall outside. An
                    unfamiliar voice said that the caller was the airport commandant and wished to
                    speak with the American Ambassador. I asked him what he wanted. He said he had
                    been instructed to call me because an American plane was asking permission to
                    land at the airfield. He could not grant permission unless the American
                    Ambassador himself certified their permission to land. I told the commandant
                    that the airlift was an operation of the United Nations. The United States had
                    assigned these planes to the UN to be flown under the flag of the U.S. The
                    commandant said his instructions were that I had to certify that permission to
                    land.</p>
                <p>I gave the commandant my word that I would come to the airport and told him that
                    if another plane came over requesting permission to land, well, let them come on
                    in. I also told him to call Minister Keita and ask him to meet me at the
                    airport. I called my deputy, Tony Ross, and asked him to meet me at the airport
                    within the next hour. I also called Major Behrens at the Hotel de France and
                    asked him to come.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>It was still raining very hard when I left the residence and dawn had broken. I
                    reached the airport first and the saluting guards informed me that the
                    commandant was upstairs in the restaurant with some Americans. Standing in the
                    door of the restaurant with a crew of young American pilots was a somewhat upset
                    airport commandant who could speak no English. He smiled with relief as I
                    approached. The captain of the American plane stepped forward and in a broad
                    Southern accent told me that he was surely glad to see me. He explained that a
                    number of C-130's had landed in Dakar. One plane had continued on to Conakry,
                    arriving there 1:00 a.m., but had not been given permission to land.</p>
                <p>It was decided in Dakar that the difficulty was due to misunderstanding because
                    the person in the tower had not spoken English clearly. Under the present terms
                    of the United Nations agreement, the Czechoslovakian national was working in the
                    tower at the Conakry airport. The next plane sent in had a French-speaking
                    American aboard and it received permission to land. I discovered that the
                    airport at Conakry had not been equipped for night landing and this American
                    plane had come in to an unfamiliar airfield during a rain storm by means of the
                    plane's landing lights and some flares sent up by the Guineans on the
                    airfield.</p>
                <p>I then learned that telegrams from Ch�teauroux, announcing the suspension of the
                    airlift, had failed to say that the delay was only temporary. Someone at the air
                    base had discovered that the airport's runway was not long enough for
                    heavily-loaded C-119 planes to take off with safety. The order had been given to
                    take the C-119's out of operation and replace them with C-130's, which could
                    easily take off fully loaded after a short run. Nobody had thought of notifying
                    Conakry that there had been a change in planes or that there would be a
                    thirteen-hour delay while sufficient C-130's were called in to carry out the
                    airlift.</p>
                <p>By this time Minister Keita had arrived in very good humor at the prospect that
                    the airlift would go on. He ordered breakfast for the American crew, Major
                    Behrens and his staff, and Ross and me. He said arrangements were made for meals
                    to be served to all American airmen who would arrive during the next two
                    days.</p>
                <p>I did not let the Guinean Minister know just how happy I had been to see that one
                    C-130 crew and learn that the airlift would go on. It was indeed an inspiring
                    sight to see the plane take off soon after with its load of soldiers and
                    supplies, and the arrival and departure of these planes at two- or three-hour
                    intervals continued for the next two days. All plane traffic was stopped after
                    5:00 p.m. and the last crew to arrive in Conakry went in to enjoy a good meal at
                    the Hotel de France.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>During the afternoon of the first day of the arrival of the C-130's, President
                    Toure and his Ministers arrived at the airport with General Diane Lansane, a
                    member of the National Political Bureau, who had been promoted to the rank of
                    general at the beginning of the Congo crisis. The General and his staff went
                    aboard the waiting C-130 after a brief ceremony. The only problem in the whole
                    situation was that one of the plane's engines had to be repaired and an engine
                    had to be flown in from Morocco, so that the Guineans installed a
                    round-the-clock watch of Guinean soldiers and everybody watched with interest
                    when this new engine was brought in and placed in place, an operation that some
                    had never seen before in their life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any repercussions from your failing to cancel
                        that first plane from the first part of the airlift?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, in addition to the satisfaction of seeing this efficiently carried
                    out operation, once it had gotten underway, was the satisfaction of receiving a
                    letter from the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, Thomas D. White,
                    congratulating me on what he called “the inspired split-second decision to
                    continue the airlift when it had apparently but mistakenly been cancelled.”
                    (laughter). So that is what you call real luck! (laughter) Because as I said, I
                    knew all of hell was going to break loose, that this black guy who was not a
                    military person had withheld military orders. Cunningham ... he was frightened,
                    you know, when he realized what was happening. And then the Major did that
                    grinning because he just knew what he thought was going to happen. But this is
                    the way it turned out.</p>
                <p>So everybody was happy because we should have been told that, “Oh, this is only
                    temporary,” even before hours and hours of waiting. But the Guineans had felt
                    that they had not been treated correctly by the UN in the first place because
                    their soldiers had not been immediately accepted, and we'll see when they come
                    back. May I at this point just cite what happened a little later on when it was
                    necessary for the Guineans to be brought back from the Congo before their time
                    was up?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, do. Before you do that though, what was the real
                        reason for wanting to cancel it? Or was it just supposed to be a
                        postponement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MORROW: It was to be postponed because the C-119's which were sent in, when they
                    were heavily loaded, in that heat, could have crashed, because Guinea didn't
                    have an airstrip which was sufficiently long enough for such a huge
                    heavily-loaded plane. When they looked at the dimensions, everybody got scared
                    and just said, “Send it back!” That's all it said. It was already loaded with
                    soldiers by then. So I felt I had no alternative. And it did take a heck of a
                    chance, and, also, that plane really wavered. See, I didn't know what the
                    problem was myself, as a lay person. But I was praying that it was going to get
                    off because it went to the end of the strip, absolutely the end, before you
                    could see it begin to go up. So it was a matter of communications, which is very
                    important.</p>
                <p>I had mentioned already that we had good-will visits by ships, so what I would
                    like to indicate was what happened when the Guinean soldiers were brought back
                    from the Congo.</p>
                <p>In an American LSD, the troops were recalled by His Excellency Sekou Toure in
                    December 1960. And they had been waiting in the Congo for transportation and
                    could get no transportation back to Guinea. So Rear Admiral Alan Reed, an
                    outstanding naval officer, had to cancel scheduled amity visits in order to
                    bring the Guinean troops to Conakry. And the LSD's under Reed's command reached
                    Conakry a day or so after the departure of Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union,
                    and welcome signs and plastic Soviet flags were still on display in the main
                    streets of Conakry. The official landing service ceremonies got underway after
                    Admiral Reed and his aide and I called on President Toure and President Toure
                    and his ministers returned the call.</p>
                <p>Now in reality, President Toure came down to the port but only his ministers went
                    aboard the flagship Hermitage to return the call. A shore cannon began firing,
                    the first contingent of Guinean troops marched ashore, smiling at the plaudits
                    and shouts of relatives and onlookers. It was several hours before the troops
                    and gear could be unloaded and President Toure and his ministers left after the
                    first contingents of the troops landed. On all sides could be heard stories of
                    friendships struck up among the Guinean soldiers and so on.</p>
                <p>Just before the start of a reception which we held at the Residence that night in
                    honor of Admiral Reed and his officers, I was made an honorary member of the
                    Hermitage crew and presented with the ship's emblem. At the conclusion of the
                    reception, the Admiral insisted that we should be his guests at dinner at the
                    Hotel de France. This was something that would be something of an outing for us
                    and a change from the form of dinners at the Residence and elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We reached Conakry at 9:15 p.m. and upon finishing a leisurely meal, Admiral Reed
                    suggested that we take coffee aboard the ship Hermitage. His car led the way to
                    the port. When it turned into the port area, its headlights revealed not only
                    that the large iron doors were shut, but they were guarded by a squad of
                    soldiers. I had never seen the gates closed before, day or night. I motioned to
                    one of the guards, who stepped forward, came to attention and saluted. He seemed
                    reluctant to answer my questions about the armed guards and the closed gate. He
                    said finally that the locked gates and the guards had been ordered by the
                    Defense Minister. I stepped out of the car to go over to speak to Admiral Reed
                    and noticed a pile of plastic Soviet flags lying under the street light. This
                    sight gave me some inkling of what might have happened.</p>
                <p>At that moment several sailors and marines returning from shore leave came into
                    sight. I outlined to Admiral Reed what probably had happened and instructed the
                    guard to call the Defense Minister and let him know that I wished to enter the
                    gates with my guests. I told the Admiral that I thought it advisable to clear
                    all American personnel out of the vicinity. The easiest way to do this was to
                    carry everybody out to the Residence in Donka. Reed and his officers agreed to
                    this idea. In a moment the necessary order was given. There were approximately
                    twenty or twenty-five American sailors, marines and officers in the gathering by
                    the time. The sailors and marines climbed into a Navy truck and jeep which had
                    been brought ashore for errands and shore patrol. There were two cars for the
                    officers and three rode with my wife. Before leaving the port I told the Guinean
                    guard that we could be reached at the Residence.</p>
                <p>Thereupon, I led through silent streets of Conakry probably one of the strangest
                    midnight processions that ever graced that tropical city. And when we reached
                    the gates of the Residence in Donka, the two soldiers, assigned as guards around
                    the clock, guards, of course, supplied by the courtesy of the Guinean
                    Government, opened the gates and stood at attention as the curious cortege
                    rolled by. The most startled were the cook and his helpers, who were still
                    cleaning up from the reception. The cook told me that a call had come from the
                    Defense Minister with information that the Defense Minister would be happy to
                    see us down at the port. I thought I would give the Minister, who lived not far
                    up the street from the Residence in Donka, sufficient time to reach Conakry. We
                    learned from the assembled naval personnel that Guinean police had. stopped
                    several enlisted men who were carrying plastic Soviet flags found on the streets
                    of Conakry. As far as could be ascertained, nobody had been arrested, but the
                    flags had been taken by the police.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>When I heard this story, I suggested that only three of us should return to
                    Conakry until the matter was cleared up. Admiral Reed, his aide and I went back
                    to the port supposedly to meet the Defense Minister. Once in the area, I saw the
                    Deputy Defense Minister standing under the light near one of the gates. He
                    stepped forward briskly and told me that the naval personnel had committed a
                    serious offense. I asked him about the nature of this offense. Pointing
                    dramatically to the pile of plastic Soviet flags, he said it was a serious
                    offense to desecrate the flag of a friendly country in Guinea. I said I knew no
                    American would willfully desecrate the flag of another nation. Furthermore, I
                    was told that some of the flags had been picked up from the streets for
                    souvenirs. I myself had seen flags dangling from poles and lying in the street
                    that very morning and heard the remarks of the Embassy chauffeur that the
                    department of public works usually cleaned up the flags very quickly after the
                    departure of dignitaries.</p>
                <p>When I asked the official how many men had been apprehended, he admitted that no
                    arrests had been made, but the flags were collected. He didn't give a
                    satisfactory explanation about locking the gates or posting a guard. I asked for
                    further proof that the flags had been taken by the Americans. He said the proof
                    was in two jeeps locked inside the gate. I said, “I want to see this evidence.”
                    The Deputy Minister then ordered the gates opened. I hurried over to Admiral
                    Reed and suggested that he go aboard the Hermitage and wait for his aide and for
                    me.</p>
                <p>The aide and the Deputy Minister and I walked to the pier and came upon the
                    Guinean soldier guarding two Navy jeeps. The Defense Minister, without a
                    flashlight, reached under the seat of one of the jeeps and pulled out one Soviet
                    flag. He walked over to the other jeep and pulled out one plastic Soviet flag. I
                    had expected to see the jeep piled high with flags and expressed my surprise at
                    seeing only two. I told the Minister that this was very little to go on, but I
                    would like to have the flags for a few hours. This appeared to me to be a case
                    of souvenir hunting which he was mistaking for something else. I reminded him
                    that the Americans had been from one end of Conakry to the other buying
                    souvenirs of their visit to Guinea. And I could easily understand why they might
                    pick up these flags lying in the street.</p>
                <p>The Deputy handed me the flags but said that he would have to have them in the
                    morning. Before returning to the Hermitage, I walked over to the customs office,
                    located near the main gate, to phone the all clear signal to the officers and
                    men in Donka. Out of the darkness from the other side of the customs office came
                    the familiar voice of an Embassy officer, Darrell Keane. Keane stepped out of an
                    Embassy car, obviously very glad to see me, and said he knew I would come to his
                    rescue. When I asked Keane what he was talking about, he said that he had been
                    locked up in the court area since leaving one of the ships at 10:30 p.m. He had
                    been told that the only way he could get out was to be released by the American
                    Ambassador. I called the guard and told him to let Keane out of the gate. Keane
                    made some kind of a record going through that exit. I telephoned my wife and
                    returned to the Hermitage to await the arrival of the men from Donka. Very
                    shortly everybody was aboard and accounted for. I told Admiral Reed that as far
                    as I was concerned, the incident was closed.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>This appeared to be an attempt to blow a minor incident into something bigger,
                    but the whole thing had fizzled out. Reed expressed the hope that I would
                    experience no problems because of the events of the evening. I assured him that
                    there would be no repercussions and bade him goodbye.</p>
                <p>The ships were to leave early that morning at high tide. I got back to Donka and
                    found the employees still cleaning up but this time they were doing so as a
                    result of the big midnight snack served to the Navy men. The staff had enjoyed
                    the unusual events of the evening and went away contented when they realized
                    they had been paid for overtime.</p>
                <p>The only reference that ever was made to this flag incident came several weeks
                    later when the police arrested some British seamen for gathering plastic flags.
                    Defense Minister Keita met me at the Pr�sidence and said laughingly that he
                    could have had my Americans picked up for the same thing. I replied that I was
                    surely glad he had not done so because it would have meant my walking all the
                    way out to Camp Alpha Yaya with two marines to get them out. This would have
                    delayed the ship's departure by a few minutes and Rear Admirals never like to be
                    late leaving a port. The conversation ended in laughter.</p>
                <p>I had been happy with the fact that there had been visits of the American ships —
                    as a matter of fact, both the Amity visits — and there was nothing wrong with
                    that feeling. It was a thrilling experience to be piped aboard those flagships
                    in December 1960, and then again in February 1961; to hear the national anthem
                    and to inspect the guards of honor. On each occasion I had experienced that
                    tingling sensation up and down my spine as I stood at attention during the
                    national anthem. Each time I had that taut feeling in my throat and had the hope
                    that there were no telltale evidences of moisture in my eyes.</p>
                <p>Let's not overlook the two visits made to Guinea by vessels from the U.S. South
                    Atlantic Fleet on amity patrol. One I've already mentioned, the one that brought
                    the Guinean troops back from the Congo and also, you recall, that they were
                    taken to the Congo by American planes commissioned by the UN. Well, the first
                    visit was made by two destroyers under the command of Commander R.A. Foreman.
                    The ship spent three days at the harbor in Conakry towards the end of December
                    1960 and afforded many Guineans their first glimpse of an American naval vessel.
                    I accompanied Commander Foreman and two of his officers on protocol visits to
                    the president of the National Assembly, Diallo, and Defense Minister Keita.
                    Guinean ministers visited the commander's flagship and enlisted personnel and
                    officers from the ship visited Conakry, played basketball with the Guineans, and
                    purchased souvenirs. Commander Foreman invited Embassy officers and our wives
                    aboard the USS Vogelgesang for dinner. I reciprocated by having a party the
                    following night at the Residence, to which were invited the ship officers and
                    staff members of the British and West German embassies. The three-days visit
                    went off without incident and the spirits of the members of the Western
                    embassies were lifted by the enthusiasm and the good nature of the visiting
                    Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The second visit I've already mentioned, is the one in which the Guinean soldiers
                    were brought back from the Congo by the LSD's under the leadership of Rear
                    Admiral Alan L. Reed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes...Could you tell us about Toure in America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: All right. It had been decided even before I went to Guinea that at some
                    point President Toure would make a State visit to the United States. And as the
                    time drew near for President Toure's State visit, I had to devote an ever
                    increasing amount of time to details that had to be supposedly settled before
                    his arrival. The State Department readily assented to my suggestion and I
                    arrived in Washington a week before the Guinean delegation to assist in last
                    minute preparations. I didn't want anything to mar this visit, for I knew that
                    all leaders in Africa were watching to see how Toure was going to be received.
                    They hoped to detect whether or not any changes in United States policy towards
                    Africa were in the making. There was no question in my mind that Negro as well
                    as white Americans were also going to be watching the drama inherent in the
                    reception by one of the world's most powerful nations of the young African who
                    had persuaded his people to say no to de Gaulle.</p>
                <p>Before leaving for Washington, I had tried without success to settle the question
                    of transportation for the delegation from Conakry to New York. I was informed
                    that President Toure wanted to be sure that the plane he boarded was not going
                    to stop at any territories still under French jurisdiction. This ruled out using
                    Air France. I could not get a satisfactory answer to the question about the
                    regulations governing the use of military air transport service planes in the
                    transportation of foreign heads of state outside the borders of the United
                    States. No commercial airlines and Western powers other than France were
                    interested at that time in establishing passenger service to Guinea.</p>
                <p>When I left Conakry for the United States on October 19, 1959, the only thing I
                    knew for certain regarding Toure's visit was that Toure was going to keep his
                    word and begin his series of State visits by coming first to the United States.
                    He was not going to Russia first, as had been reported in some quarters. It was
                    not until after I had departed that the transportation dilemma was solved
                    through the generosity of Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, who placed at
                    President Toure's disposal a Ghanaian Airlines plane to make connections with a
                    Pan American flight. Thanks to Nkrumah, the delegation was able to board the
                    plane that touched down late Sunday afternoon, October 25th, at New York's
                    International Airport.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I didn't have to be on hand in New York; it's just the official visit did not
                    start until the following day in Washington. President and Mrs. Toure and party
                    of six were met by Guinean Ambassador and Mrs. Telli Diallo, U.S. protocol chief
                    Wiley Buchanan, and some New York officials. The following day, the military air
                    transport plane bearing the Guinean delegation landed promptly at 12:00 noon at
                    the terminal in Washington. President Toure was the first to descend from the
                    plane. He saw, among others, waiting below to greet him, Vice President and Mrs.
                    Nixon, Secretary of State and Mrs. Christian Herter, Chief of Staff of the
                    United States Army and Mrs. Lemnitzer, the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and Mrs.
                    Sevilla Sacasa, numerous Washington officials, and myself. Ambassador Diallo,
                    Vice President Nixon, Protocol Chief Buchanan and I accompanied President Toure
                    to the speaker's platform and stood with him during the airport ceremony. A
                    twenty-one gun salute, the Guinean and American national anthems, and the
                    inspection of the honor guard by President Toure were followed by brief speeches
                    by the Vice President and Toure.</p>
                <p>Nixon assured Toure America would receive him warmly because of personal
                    interests Americans had in him and the future of his country. Toure expressed
                    the hope that his visit would bring closer relations between the United States
                    and Guinea as well as with other emerging African nations.</p>
                <p>I was indeed moved by the occasion. It was only later that I learned that Vice
                    President and Mrs. Nixon, who had been vacationing in Florida, had been summoned
                    hastily back from their visit to Washington to meet the African delegation, and
                    they had not been too happy at these events.</p>
                <p>Our motorcade departure from the terminal en route to Blair House, the
                    President's guest home on Pennsylvania Avenue, by way of this traditional
                    Washington parade route, signaled the beginning of twelve of the fullest days I
                    have ever spent. It was exhilarating to see the more than two hundred and fifty
                    thousand people standing along the route to catch a glimpse of the man who had
                    taken a dramatic and solitary stand against Charles de Gaulle. The Washington
                    onlookers, I felt, were very generous with their applause and the visitors were
                    pleased with the warm reception on that chilly October day.</p>
                <p>The same was to be true in New York some ten days later, when an even larger
                    crowd greeted the visitors during a ticker-tape parade from the Battery to City
                    Hall. By mistake, New York had on display Ghanaian flags instead of Guinean
                    flags. They looked quite similar.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The white-tie state dinner given that night by President and Mrs. Eisenhower in
                    honor of President and Mrs. Toure marked my second visit to the White House. And
                    as the car in which I was riding came to a stop under the portico, the real
                    significance of the situation suddenly struck me and I thought that only in
                    America could something like this happen. I, a slave's grandson, was entering
                    the official residence of the President of the United States. I was to be
                    escorted down the long corridor to the East Room by an army official in full
                    dress uniform. And at the door of the East Room, my name and title would be
                    announced. And between the moment of leaving the car and mounting the White
                    House steps, a feeling of deep regret swept over me; regret that my wife,
                    daughter and son were far away in Guinea and not on hand to share this historic
                    evening with me; regret that my parents were not living to see the fulfillment
                    of their prophesy.</p>
                <p>When President and Mrs. Eisenhower and their guests had descended from the
                    upstairs living quarters, those of us assembled in the East Room walked slowly
                    as couples to the state dining room at the opposite end of the White House, and
                    where the tables, glistening with silverware, glassware and emblazoned dishes,
                    decorated with beautiful flowers, awaited us.</p>
                <p>I had the good fortune to be seated between the beautiful and charming Mrs.
                    Gregor Piatigorsky, wife of the famous cellist, and Ambassador George B. Allen,
                    then director of the USIA. The evening passed quickly and pleasantly. Light
                    speeches of welcome and acknowledgment were made by Presidents Eisenhower and
                    Toure and Gregor Piatigorsky was in excellent form that evening at the concert,
                    which concluded the evening.</p>
                <p>The real high point of the dinner, however, was the incredible performance of
                    Colonel Walters, the interpreter, who presented us with the French version of
                    Eisenhower's speech and the English version of Toure's reply. Without notes or
                    props, Walters gave the complete Eisenhower speech. He translated Toure's reply
                    paragraph by paragraph, and this was no small feat because Toure spoke in long
                    sentences. Only a skillful interpreter could have done justice to Toure's
                    eloquent French.</p>
                <p>If Colonel Walters' virtuosity had impressed me at dinner, I was even more
                    impressed during the meeting that took place between Presidents Eisenhower and
                    Toure the next morning. A private meeting had been arranged for the two
                    presidents. President Toure made it known that he wanted to be accompanied by
                    the president of the Guinean National Assembly, Saifoulaye Diallo, the Economy
                    Minister, Louis Beavogui, and the Interior Minister, Fodeba Keita. This change
                    in plan caused me to accompany Secretary of State Herter and Assistant Secretary
                    Satterthwaite to the Tuesday morning meeting at the White House. Guinean
                    Ambassador Telli Diallo was also present.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We heard a very stimulating and exceedingly frank exchange in views between the
                    two presidents, with Colonel Walters again serving as interpreter. An hour
                    later, we left the White House to attend a meeting at the State Department,
                    presided over by Undersecretary of State Robert Murphy. A joint working party
                    was set up after this meeting to iron out the details of a cultural agreement
                    which was signed on Wednesday morning by Secretary Herter, Minister Beavogui,
                    who was appointed acting Foreign Minister on the spot by President Toure for the
                    signing ceremony. Ambassador Diallo and I were asked to sign as witnesses. I
                    later received an autographed photograph of the signing ceremony from Secretary
                    Herter.</p>
                <p>President Toure made a memorable appearance before the National Press Club at the
                    luncheon which immediately followed the Tuesday morning meeting at the State
                    Department. He spoke and accepted questions from the floor, which he parried
                    with the skill acquired in debates at Paris, Dakar and Conakry, impressing
                    veterans of the press with his stage presence. That same night we attended a
                    dinner at the Anderson's house given by Secretary and Mrs. Herter. The afternoon
                    of our last day in Washington, President and Mrs. Toure gave a luncheon in honor
                    of President and Mrs. Eisenhower in the State Room at the Mayflower Hotel.</p>
                <p>Between the official obligation of the Washington visit, President Toure and the
                    Guinean delegation and I journeyed by presidential helicopter to Mount Vernon;
                    participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
                    The National Cemetery in Arlington; visited the AFL-CIO headquarters for a talk
                    with president George Meany; attended a reception at Africa House by the African
                    Students Association; visited Howard University and met the president and
                    faculty; visited the mosque of the Washington Islamic Center. And President and
                    Mrs. Toure attended a reception given in their honor by the Chiefs of Mission of
                    Guinea, Liberia, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Ethiopia, the United Arab
                    Republic and Ghana.</p>
                <p>Contrary to the predictions of those who dubbed Toure a hardheaded Marxist
                    theorist, but not Communist, and had insisted that he would straddle the fence
                    between the East and the West to obtain aid from both sides, Toure made no
                    requests for American aid during his visit, and his failure to do so surprised
                    even some career diplomats.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Toure later explained to his people why he did not request any aid during his
                    visit to America: “We found in the United States a real desire to come to our
                    assistance, but we refused to present demands of this nature. Everybody knows
                    perfectly well the different needs of different people reported to be poor. It
                    is indeed radical nature which determines the quality of the needs but for
                    economic ... It isn't radical nature which determines the quality of the needs,
                    but the economic state. Consequently, nations that really wished to aid Guinea
                    or any other developing people don't have to wait to be solicited. We are
                    certainly not going to disguise ourselves as beggars to explain our indigence,
                    which everybody knows, which everybody can appreciate, and to which each can
                    loyally and in strict respect of our sovereignty, bring remedy. If we had placed
                    African dignity so high, it is not to bargain it tomorrow against the few
                    subsidies which, in the final analysis, could not radically suppress the effects
                    of spoliation, exploitation, oppression, depersonalization in which colonialism
                    caused us to submit.”</p>
                <p>On the surface, the Washington phase of the visit had gone off with clocklike
                    precision and been eminently successful. Our guests, however, were quite
                    disappointed on two scores, and rather dissatisfied on the third. They knew that
                    President Eisenhower had come to the airport to welcome the President of Mexico
                    and Premier Khrushchev of Russia. They had expected him to come meet President
                    Toure also. They were not impressed by the fact that Vice President Nixon had
                    cut short a Miami vacation to greet Toure. Nor did they wish to accept the
                    explanation that President Eisenhower's bronchitis kept him from attending the
                    ceremony on the chilly autumn day. The Guineans were further dismayed when they
                    learned that Protocol Chief Wiley Buchanan, who had accompanied Premier
                    Khrushchev on his U.S. tour, had assigned his deputy to accompany President
                    Toure. They assumed that their visit was being downgraded.</p>
                <p>The third problem arose on the eve of Toure's departure from Washington and
                    concerned the State Department interpreter assigned for Toure's speech. The
                    Guineans had been most happy with Colonel Walters. They were very unhappy when
                    they learned that the interpreter assigned to cover Toure's speech at the Africa
                    House would accompany the President throughout America. Their unhappiness was
                    registered with the Department and with me in no uncertain terms. But it was not
                    possible at that late date to supply a substitute. The situation became such
                    before the tour was over that the Department of State had to provide another
                    interpreter for the Toure speech during the New York phase of the visit.</p>
                <p>We visited New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Ohio and also Durham. Now, Toure had
                    wanted to go to Atlanta because years ago President Tubman had made a visit to
                    Georgia. But it was decided this was inadvisable, so the problem to have visited
                    the South was settled when Governor Luther Hodges of North Caroline issued an
                    invitation for President Toure and his party to be the guests of his state.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>And also, one other exception was that I was assigned to move with this group
                    throughout the United States. As a rule, the Ambassador merely would be present
                    in Washington, but this procedure was decided upon apparently to make the
                    Guineans feel more at home. It worked out successfully, even though it's a
                    little dangerous sometimes for people to have to be together for two weeks at a
                    time, especially if there happen to be some prima donnas in the group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a good thing that they did have you with them
                        considering the other things that didn't go so well between the government —
                        our government and that delegation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, you haven't mentioned Los Angeles but there is a question I wondered about.
                    Do you want to talk about Los Angeles? And then I'll raise the question I have
                    about it. It has to do with his visit.</p>
                <p>MORROW: Oh yes, all right. I think I should mention specifically about the visit
                    to Los Angeles because an unusual incident took place. The most significant
                    event in the Los Angeles visit was a little publicized meeting in Disneyland
                    between President Toure and John F. Kennedy, who at that time was a Senator from
                    the state of Massachusetts. This private meeting had been planned originally for
                    Sunday evening at the Ambassador Hotel but had been changed to Sunday morning,
                    November 1st, at Disneyland. This was indeed an historic meeting between the two
                    young leaders: one who was destined to become president of this great land and
                    one who had won independence for his nation.</p>
                <p>Senator Kennedy was then chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Senate
                    Committee on Foreign Relations. He had expressed a point of view about Algerian
                    independence that did not place him on the side of the French. After
                    introductions, the two men exchanged pleasantries about each other's youthful
                    appearance and implied that youth was probably an important attribute for a
                    leader in today's world.</p>
                <p>Senator Kennedy then expressed his keen interest in Guinean independence and in
                    the struggle confronting Toure to maintain this independence. Turning to me, he
                    said that, with all due respect to me and to the party which I represented, he
                    would like to go on record as assuring President Toure that if the Democratic
                    Party came into power in the 1960 election, he would certainly have a great
                    interest in the progress of Guinea and other emerging nations of Africa. Senator
                    Kennedy wished President Toure well in his efforts to improve conditions in
                    Guinea and quipped that at least the two had only one political party to deal
                    with in Guinea even though its symbol was an elephant, syli.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>In reply, President Toure expressed warmly his appreciation to the Senator for
                    his willingness to confer with the delegation and for his expression of interest
                    in the Guinean experience. Toure assured him that such a personal contact was
                    most important in fostering better understanding and improved relations among
                    nations. Toure made it clear that he and his colleagues had followed with great
                    interest the Senator's stand on Algerian independence. He concluded by wishing
                    Kennedy continuing success in his future endeavors.</p>
                <p>The next time they met was at the White House in 1962 when Toure conferred with
                    Kennedy as President of the United States. Something in the personality of this
                    handsome, young, well-poised Senator struck a responsive cord in the Guineans.
                    They were not more enthusiastic in their reactions to any other American than
                    they were to Kennedy. They praised his youth, his courage, his astonishing
                    knowledge of world affairs in general, and of the problems of developing
                    countries in particular. They enjoyed the distinction drawn by Kennedy between
                    the policies on Africa pursued by the two major American political parties. They
                    believed what Kennedy had said concerning Guinea and Africa if the Democratic
                    Party won the November 1960 election.</p>
                <p>When the Guineans returned to Conakry, they were still talking about their
                    meeting with Kennedy in Disneyland. There were no observers of the American
                    political campaign of 1960 more interested than were the men who had visited
                    America and had met Kennedy. Minister Fodeba Keita, after apologizing for
                    appearing to interfere in the internal affairs of my country, told me that if he
                    were an American, he would certainly vote for Kennedy because of the quality of
                    his leadership. The Guineans were very happy when they learned in August 1960
                    that Kennedy, the Democratic presidential candidate, was sending Governor
                    Averell Harriman to Africa on a fact-finding mission that included Guinea in the
                    itinerary. They were more elated when Kennedy was elected president and they
                    were shocked and genuinely grieved by the loss of the young president to an
                    assassin's bullet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Morrow, why was Disneyland chosen as a site of that
                        meeting for Kennedy and Toure? Any special reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MORROW: This question has often been raised because one would think that because
                    it's such a public place the visit would be noticed. But it turned out to be the
                    other way around. Because of its very location and the nature of it, very little
                    was ever known about this visit. In fact, no publicity was given to it; some
                    pictures were taken but they were taken by, I think, photographers of the USIS.
                    So why it was changed, there was never any real explanation, but it was very odd
                    to think of going to Disneyland. That's the first time I ever had an opportunity
                    to visit there and, incidentally, to ride on that little train that goes around
                    the lot and so on. The Guineans enjoyed it. But the significant thing is: Why
                    did Kennedy take the time to come all the way out to the coast to visit with
                    President Toure? Did he know something nobody else knew? Or was he that sure of
                    winning the election? We don't know. But it was a very unique incident to have
                    the U.S. Senator. Of course it was true that he was chairman of the Subcommittee
                    on African Affairs and that gave a reason actually for visiting. But after all,
                    Toure had come to Washington, and, as I recall, Kennedy was not at that state
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Disneyland did the actual meeting take
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: In ... I forgot ... I should remember the name of the place ... it was
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was such a huge place!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Yes it's such a huge building. No, it wasn't in what you call a fun house
                    — I'm trying to remember. You walked in this place which had been reserved for
                    the meeting. There's a picture in the book that will show the group emerging,
                    and if you take a look you see that Kennedy can be seen along with Toure. You
                    notice that there's an airline hostess in the group and quite a few people
                    following, but they were members of the entourage. Just a few onlookers,
                    visitors to Disneyland, but they were unaware ... they were by and large
                    unaware. So I decided for this reason that if he, Kennedy, were to come up with
                    an entourage and a crowd to the Ambassador Hotel, everybody would have had some
                    knowledge of this thing; whereas by being in Disneyland, sort of unusual, people
                    were taken by surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The other question I wanted to ask had to do with our
                        relations with Guinea after that visit. How did that visit affect future
                        relations between the United States and Guinea, considering a number of
                        things happened while he was here that really weren't too complimentary.
                        After all, the President didn't come to visit him as he arrived; a number of
                        other things happened that tended to make them unhappy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MORROW: Well, the real impact of and significance of this meeting came actually
                    after Kennedy became the president. And a decision was made about the change of
                    ambassador because of the change of party. And the fact that Kennedy had sent
                    Governor Averell Harriman to visit not only Africa but specifically Guinea. And
                    on the recommendations of Harriman — Harriman was there three days; he had very
                    frank talks about the situation — Kennedy paid attention to the observations,
                    I'm sure, made by Harriman, and he also paid attention to some of the reports
                    which we had been sending back all along to Washington that had been
                    ignored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Reports on the fact that some effort really should be made to take Guinea
                    seriously and to set up a type of aid program that would be beneficial to them.
                    You see, my emphasis was always on health and education and Harriman agreed with
                    it. Not military, military suppliers or big stadia or the showy things, but
                    something that really would affect the people. And Kennedy had his man Attwood
                    come in there and they were supposedly going to work in that direction. But then
                    fate came into the picture with his assassination and, of course, after that
                    there was obviously a change. But there was a great hope, I'm sure, among the
                    Guineans, as soon as Kennedy came into office, and then the fact that he had
                    Toure make a visit in 1962, and it was in contrast that he was there on the spot
                    and Toure had the chance to feel, oh I'm meeting a friend. It was a different
                    situation altogether. The tragedy is that Kennedy was removed from the scene ...
                    but, then, that affected not only the Guinean situation but affected the
                    American situation. Very unique happening, however, to see a Senator and an
                    African leader establish a type of rapport which was established from that
                    meeting on.</p>
                <p>The kind of welcome we received in Guinea was carefully noted and reported by
                    diplomats of the West and of the East, for everything that was done by the
                    United States and by any one of the representatives was observed closely with
                    the view of detecting possible implications for the future — future, that is, of
                    U.S. and Guinean relations. The outside world was informed of what had happened
                    during our arrival through a release that was filed possibly by a representative
                    of the French press who was still covering Guinea. I was more interested,
                    however, in an editorial appearing in the August 14th edition of the Washington
                    Post, especially since it was the newspaper which had sharply challenged my
                    appointment because of my color and lack of experience in diplomacy and in
                    dealing with Communism.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The Washington Post observed: “Not long ago we had occasion to comment upon the
                    selection of Dr. John Howard Morrow, a distinguished Negro educator, as American
                    Ambassador to the new Republic of Guinea. We observed that there was an element
                    of condescension in the appointment of a Negro to a Negro country and expressed
                    the wish that a professional diplomat had been sent to this sensitive post. So
                    far as a reception of Dr. Morrow is concerned, our misgivings appear to have
                    been misplaced. His background of international experience will help him to
                    represent the United States adequately in a newly independent nation subject to
                    many pulls. Nevertheless, the principle of assignment by merit rather than by
                    race still needs attention. For this reason, we are happy that a white diplomat,
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State L. S. Mathews, has been confirmed as a new
                    ambassador to Liberia. For years, the post in Monrovia has been regarded as a
                    segregated position for Negro politicians, chosen not for their ability but for
                    their color. Let us hope that the appointment of Mr. Mathews points to the
                    evolution of a genuinely colorblind policy, meaning not merely incorporation of
                    more qualified Negroes into the Foreign Service, but also assignment on the
                    basis of qualification regardless of race.”</p>
                <p>It struck me as ironic that a mere outward manifestation, an airport ceremony, or
                    a cheering populace, would cause a newspaper like the Washington Post to
                    reassess my chance for success in Guinea, a crisis post. Surely, the basic
                    situation had not changed in the least, for I had yet to confront the problems
                    of this African assignment. Reading the editorial, I hoped that at the close of
                    my tour of duty some criteria less fugitive than this might be used to assess
                    the success or the failure of any mission, mine included.</p>
                <p>Yet I did sense, on my first day in Guinea and afterwards, that the people of
                    Guinea saw in me the symbol of all that the United States, even with its
                    problems of racial discrimination and segregation, meant for freedom-loving
                    people everywhere: liberty, justice, equality, self-determination, help for the
                    mistreated and the downtrodden. This, I had to tell myself, is what that
                    American flag meant flying on that old Cadil1ac. This is what the representative
                    of the United States, Negro or white, meant to the people of Guinea. Perhaps
                    this is what the Washington Post meant when it printed its second
                    assessment.</p>
                <p>Now three rooms had been reserved for us at the Hotel de France, which looked
                    down on the ocean. Except for its louver boards — a concession to life a few
                    degrees above the Equator — the Hotel de France appeared to be a grand Parisian
                    hotel transferred to any tropical city. The hotel was still under French
                    management and the prices matched those of any large hotel on the right bank in
                    Paris. The food and service would later begin to reflect the difficulties
                    brought on by the severance of economic ties between France and Guinea. The
                    chancery had inadequate facilities, but I accepted them because of the
                    difficulty of securing adequate office space in Conakry.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The question about the chancery in Conakry was later raised in an article in the
                    New Leader, June 27, 1960, entitled In Guinea We Have Faith. It was written by
                    Dr. Norman Palmer, chairman of the International Relations Program at the
                    University of Pennsylvania after a twenty-five nation tour of Asia and Africa.
                    Dr. Palmer reported, “The American Embassy was located on a second floor of an
                    eight-story building. When I asked why no American flag was displayed (I was
                    acutely conscious of the hammer and sickle so prominent a few blocks away), I
                    was given lame excuses: a proper supporting base for the flag had not been
                    found; the Embassy was in temporary quarters; the only flag available had
                    forty-eight stars, and so forth.”</p>
                <p>“No United States Information Service office had been opened, though I was told
                    that an acting USIS officer had been assigned to Guinea. The International
                    Cooperation Administration had done almost nothing except send several people to
                    make surveys, and by the end of 1959, no further evidence of ICA interest had
                    been manifested.”</p>
                <p>Now toward the end of an inspection tour of American property — Embassy property,
                    that is — I was still in a hopeful mood. However, as we drove from Conakry to a
                    suburb called Donka, to visit the official residence for the first time, after a
                    drive of some twenty-five or thirty minutes, the driver swerved suddenly off the
                    main road, drove on a winding, narrow road lined by trees and thickets that gave
                    one the impression literally of entering the brush. After a few moments, I saw
                    in the distance a structure built of cement, similar in appearance to a
                    California ranch house. It had been white originally, but the rainy season had
                    deprived it of any luster it once may have had. The grounds surrounding the
                    villa, as it was called, were overgrown with weeds and thickets that seemed an
                    excellent breeding ground for snakes. Subsequent clearing of the ground proved
                    that the guess about the presence of snakes, large ones, had been only too
                    correct.</p>
                <p>A wizened Guinean with a machete in one hand opened the gate and the car
                    proceeded up the drive, as yet unpaved, to the entrance. When I learned that the
                    Guinean who had opened the gate was the gardener, as well as the guardian, I
                    wondered how he spent his time when the only things growing were the weeds,
                    vines, and thickets that cluttered the place. I wondered too what the American
                    Embassy staff had been doing. For almost six months they had known that an
                    ambassador was coming to Guinea. For more than two months the identity of the
                    American chosen had been known and his expected date of arrival certainly had
                    not been a secret!</p>
                <p>The Residence was not ready for us, we were told, because there was a dearth of
                    capable carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and painters in and around Conakry
                    after the hasty departure of most of the French. But I succeeded in getting the
                    administrative staff of the Embassy to locate the necessary workmen within a
                    ten-day period, which led me to believe that the same thing could have been done
                    before my arrival. The excuses of the officer who had been in charge of getting
                    the Residence ready were not impressive. I'd already seen the houses and grounds
                    occupied by him and by the charg� d'affaires. They were in excellent condition,
                    not to mention the outdoor swimming pool with fresh water that went with one of
                    the houses.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>My first look inside the villa, so it was called, was no more reassuring than my
                    view of the grounds. The plaster was already showing through the paint in some
                    of the places on the walls, the ceilings, even though this villa, constructed
                    only a few months ago, had never been occupied. The floors of the dining room
                    and the living room, or the salon, were done in an attractive charcoal gray tile
                    with a white streak, ideally suited for heavy traffic in a country having six
                    months of rain and six of dryness.</p>
                <p>The salon, like the dining room, received ventilation through louver boards and
                    the size could be increased by opening folding doors that led out to a good size
                    veranda also covered with tile. The room designated on the floor plans back in
                    Washington as a master bedroom turned out to be an ordinary-sized bedroom with
                    an adjoining shower. At the end of the hall were two small bedrooms separated by
                    a bathroom. Midway down the hall there was a very small water closet, opposite
                    which were large clothes closets that could be entered through sliding door
                    panels. Just off the entrance leading into the salon was the small room equipped
                    with a commode and wash basin. To reach the salon when entering the villa
                    through the doorway that looked out upon a circular driveway, it was necessary
                    to walk down two steps. To enter the dining room from the salon it was necessary
                    to walk up two steps.</p>
                <p>On seeing the small kitchen that was set off from the salon, I found it difficult
                    to visualize how we would handle the dinners and receptions we would have to
                    give. That this kitchen did serve these very purposes once we moved in is a
                    tribute to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of my devoted and tireless wife.
                    There were no rooms in the Residence for visiting dignitaries, which meant that
                    these guests would have to stay at the Hotel de France in Conakry. It was not
                    always easy to obtain hotel reservations because many of the rooms were reserved
                    for diplomatic representatives from the various embassies. The plans for
                    enlarging the official Residence, discussed often during my stay in Guinea, were
                    never acted upon, not until I had departed.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Not all the furniture earmarked for the Residence had arrived. Other pieces,
                    designated originally to be kept in the warehouse until our arrival, had
                    mysteriously found their way into the living rooms and kitchens of houses
                    occupied by American personnel at the post. The furniture for the salon was
                    piled in the middle of the floor; beds had not been put together; the oven in
                    the kitchen stove which ran on butane gas, a very scarce commodity in Guinea,
                    did not work. It was not until some weeks later when this stove burst into
                    flames that we got a substitute stove from the warehouse. It had been set aside
                    for non-existent ICA personnel. But no matter how meticulously equipment is
                    assigned in Washington, it has a way of showing up in use in unexpected spots,
                    and we had done our share. For that matter, many, many months were to pass
                    before the Embassy silverware, tablecloths and napkins reached Conakry. The
                    administrative section in Conakry had forgotten to put through the necessary
                    requisitions before our arrival. Fortunately, my wife had had the foresight to
                    bring along our silverware in the personal luggage along with other necessities.
                    Only thus was it possible to begin, without embarrassing delay, the luncheons,
                    dinners and receptions demanded by protocol.</p>
                <p>As I surveyed the situation at the official Residence during this first
                    inspection, I was very glad to have come without my wife. She might have found
                    the appearance of the grounds and the villa, as well as the interior disarray,
                    extremely frustrating. I was able to get that portion of the grounds closest to
                    the main gate cleared off before I took her and our daughter and son to see
                    their new home. The cleaning up of the entrance improved the villa's general
                    appearance so much that when my wife did see the Residence and grounds for the
                    first time, she immediately sensed the possibilities. From the moment of our
                    occupancy, my wife toiled until she succeeded in bringing beauty to surroundings
                    which had been drab and forlorn.</p>
                <p>A redeeming feature of the location of the Residence was that the ocean lay just
                    off the expanse of land extending from the house down to a small stretch of
                    sandy beach. Often the lapping of the ocean waves and the voices of Guinean
                    fishermen returning with the day's catch were the only noises that broke the
                    all-enveloping silence of approaching nightfall.</p>
                <p>The temperate ocean water, despite the alleged presence of sharks as reported by
                    local inhabitants, was the chief source of recreation and physical fitness for
                    my family and me. The small beach area was shared later with our neighbors,
                    Ambassador and Mrs. Herbert Schroeder, when they arrived from the Federal
                    Republic of Germany, West Germany. The beach was visited occasionally by the
                    Bulgarian Ambassador and his family, who lived nearby, as well as by the Soviet
                    Ambassador, who drove out from Conakry for a swim.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The Guineans who had worked as butlers, cooks, chauffeurs and house servants for
                    the French, were now working for the Guinean ministers or other government
                    officials. Many had left Guinea to seek employment in Dakar, Freetown, or
                    Abidjan. I had to interview a great many applicants, none of whom actually had
                    the qualifications for the job, before I selected three of the more suitable
                    ones. I left to my wife the responsibility of training them. For a chef I
                    selected a Foulah in his early forties, who had once served as a dishwasher and
                    kitchen helper in Dakar. As his helper, I chose an alert, young Malinke, who
                    knew nothing about working in a kitchen but did know how to iron shirts. For the
                    third employee, responsible for keeping the Residence clean, I hired a young
                    Foulah, who spoke and understood only his dialect. We retained the
                    guardian/gardener, who spoke no French and only a smattering of Malinke and
                    whose dialect was Kissi. We retained also the chauffeur who had driven for the
                    Embassy before our arrival. He was an intelligent young Sousou, who spoke fairly
                    good French.</p>
                <p>It was inspiring and reassuring to see the manner in which my daughter and wife
                    trained these employees and developed them into a smoothly working team with an
                    unmistakable esprit de corps. They learned to handle effectively luncheons,
                    dinners and receptions given for the members of the Guinean Government, the
                    diplomatic corps and for visiting United States senators and other dignitaries.
                    Little did our guests realize the hours spent in teaching a former dishwasher
                    how to prepare a delicate hors d'oeuvre, or to cook French and American dishes,
                    or in instructing two nervous young Guineans who had never before served meals,
                    to set a table correctly and serve without spilling soup or wine on d�collet�
                    guests.</p>
                <p>The guard's inability to speak French proved to be no obstacle to his learning to
                    understand that my wife expected him to clear the ground of all undergrowth,
                    keep the lawns neat, and plant beds of flowers. Before our stay in Guinea was
                    over, the guard could understand some French and had also developed some skill
                    in gardening. He became our most faithful and trusted employee and saw to it
                    that no harm ever came to our persons or to the Embassy property.</p>
                <p>The fact that my wife was an excellent cook was an inestimable asset,
                    particularly since it was impossible to obtain trained service in Guinea. At the
                    outset, she had to do all of the cooking for the dinners and the preparation of
                    hors d'oeuvres for receptions, in addition to being ready on time to act as
                    hostess. At first she had to go into Conakry to do the marketing, usually done
                    by one chef and his helper, if one had a real chef who knew what he was doing.
                    The task of marketing became incredibly difficult as French ships stopped
                    bringing fresh produce and meats to Guinea and the shelves in the stores were
                    gradually depleted. Fortunately for us, my wife and daughter had made it a
                    policy from the very start to shop at an African market as well as in the stores
                    still run by the French. When the French disappeared from the stores and shops
                    in Conakry and Guineans took over, my wife and daughter benefited from having
                    patronized Guinean merchants.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>At times I thought my wife possessed the skill of a magician when I tasted the
                    dishes she miraculously created with eggs, fish, shrimp, chicken, mutton,
                    rabbits, lobsters, couscous, manioc, spinach, mangoes, avocados, pineapples,
                    tomatoes, rice, bananas, almonds, red and green peppers and a host of other
                    mysterious ingredients. She could prepare a dinner for twelve or a reception for
                    one hundred and fifty or more. The acclaim won by her cuisine in Conakry and
                    Donka was well merited.</p>
                <p>It was necessary to have luncheon or dinner guests at the Residence on an average
                    of two or three times a week, not to speak of breakfasts or teas for the ladies,
                    or to have receptions every two or three weeks. And I am keenly aware that my
                    wife served above and beyond the call of duty. In the heat and humidity of the
                    Guinean coastal region, she also had to accompany me on the remaining evenings
                    to dinners, receptions and other affairs given by Guinean officials or members
                    of the diplomatic corps. And through it all, including the six months of rainy
                    weather and the six months of dryness each year, she retained her aplomb,
                    patience and sunny disposition.</p>
                <p>The considerate treatment and training received by the Guineans (laughter)
                    employed at the Residence, news of which promptly reached the rank and file of
                    the populace in Donka, the volunteer work of my daughter as a nurse's health
                    aide in the hospital in Donka and later as teacher of English in the girls'
                    lyc�e, and my son's coaching of his classmates in basketball and tennis at the
                    boys' lyc�e, accounted to some degree for the warmth of our reception not only
                    in Guinea but in other cities and villages of Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sir, before you move on there, the problem ... the things
                        you faced when you looked at your residence the first time, is that
                        experience customary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: That is the very question that I had in my mind. Now I know we were
                    thousands of miles away from the United States, but the fact that there was a
                    warehouse — in the beginning I didn't know this — that was filled with different
                    kinds of equipment, stoves, you just name whatever it is, available already in
                    Guinea, raised a big question in my mind as to the intent of the people who were
                    already there on the scene and — I haven't mentioned this — maybe it might come
                    up later, but before I ever got out to Guinea, the person who was the charg�
                    d'affaires originally had asked to be returned to the Department of State. He
                    was supposed to stay there at least until the new ambassador would show up. This
                    angered the people in Washington because they felt that there was an implication
                    perhaps, shall I say the word, of racism in this man's desire to be removed
                    before the ambassador even got there. They wouldn't acquiesce to his request and
                    of course he was on the scene when I got to Guinea. And we got along ... and I
                    told him I could get along with the devil. Not too long after my arrival,
                    however, he was sent back because he no longer had rapport with the Guinean
                    Government.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>There is something else, and I might take it up in a moment because I would like
                    to deal specifically with the reaction, be a little bit more specific about the
                    reaction of the Embassy staff to my presence. This might answer that, and then
                    I'll be willing to elaborate if it's necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Yes, what about the reaction of the Foreign Service office and my
                    presence in Guinea? Several thought the State Department lacked wisdom in
                    sending to Guinea a man with no previous experience as a diplomat. It was ...
                    not just that the assigning of a non-career person meant that this was one more
                    top position closed to career officers who, understandably enough, considered an
                    ambassadorial appointment a culmination of a successful career. It was perhaps
                    the feeling of professionals that another professional should have been called
                    upon to handle such a precarious situation. All these officers found themselves
                    in the position, for the first time in their lives, of serving under a black.
                    Several were bedeviled by the stereotypes so familiar on the home front
                    concerning second-class citizenship and the possible lowering of standards. It
                    did not take long to dispel their erroneous ideas. In the meantime, however, I
                    did encounter from the staff some silent treatment, some slowness in complying
                    with requests for vital information, some resistance to instructions that
                    greater efforts be made to establish friendlier contacts with their Guinean
                    counterparts. There was a decided complacency among some of the Americans who
                    were interested merely in maintaining contacts with other Western members of the
                    diplomatic corps, of whom all but a few were equally ignorant about the thoughts
                    and the objectives of members of the Guinean Government. It is not possible to
                    reveal here how I set about improving the morale and organizing an effective
                    working organization at the American Embassy. I say it is not possible, and yet
                    I think I change my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Because at a particular point in the history of relationships with
                    members of the Embassy staff, I made a decision which shook up Washington. I
                    requested that the charg� d'affaires who had replaced the charg� who wanted to
                    go home, and his wife, be removed from the African scene. Now this is a very
                    serious ... something to happen to a person who is a career Foreign Service
                    officer. But the indications were that this individual had lost rapport with the
                    Guinean Government and was ineffectual in his dealings with them. And there was
                    also certain implication that since they had served in another section of Africa
                    — in South Africa — where the treatment of blacks was much different from what
                    the Guineans with their independence wanted, that they were not able to make the
                    transition. Washington was shocked by the request, but they acquiesced. So, by
                    December of 1960, we had such a smoothly-working team, with such excellent
                    morale, that I was called aside by the commander of destroyers from the U.S.
                    South Atlantic Fleet, in port for an amity visit, and questioned as to how it
                    had been possible to develop such esprit de corps in a hardship post.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could I ask you a couple more questions about that? I
                        think it would be very helpful if you could talk a little more about how you
                        coped with people who were terribly unhelpful. How were you able to turn
                        them around? Because that experience could have made you very bitter and
                        could have made it impossible for you to function. How did you turn them
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, maybe it might have been a number of small things. Take one
                    instance. Nobody in the immediate Guinean Government set up at that time could
                    speak any English. If you were going to deal with them, you had to speak French.
                    I'm sorry to say the shock that I discovered that few of the people who had been
                    sent to Guinea by the State Department could speak French. One chap who was a
                    Princeton graduate and had a little French, thought that he was up to the
                    situation and had to translate a document that had been sent in from Washington
                    for a particular Guinea Government, and he brought it to ask my approval. And
                    not trying to act like the professor and so on, there were so many mistakes, I
                    had to correct these mistakes in French. This came as a terrific shock to that
                    young man. I didn't get after him about the situation; I quietly made the
                    corrections, had the secretary put it into the document and then presented it to
                    him. Now that was very good therapy for a rather swollen youngster who had such
                    a wonderful estimate that here was some black person out of the blue who was
                    coming into the situation not only to be the ambassador, but also confronted
                    with having to handle a foreign language.</p>
                <p>Then the treatment, sometimes in an embassy there's a terrific difference made by
                    the person who is the Chief of Mission and the Chief of Mission's wife with
                    other folks in the situation. But we were thousands of miles away as this small
                    group. So in these affairs, my wife would not necessarily observe the fact that
                    you had to be such and such an officer, but she would invite all of the Embassy,
                    including the clerks and the people who lived thousands of miles away from home.
                    Now the good old career Foreign Service officers might not have particularly
                    liked that, but it did develop a certain kind of a strain and it came out when
                    we had visits from Senator Symington and Mr. Harriman. I might be a little more
                    specific at that point in time. As a matter of fact, I'm getting ready to talk
                    in terms of ... of some people who visited besides the fleet.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>As for anger, at one point I did get very angry and then realized that that would
                    not solve the situation. So I had to remain — what is the present expression? —
                    cool. However, a relative, let's be specific, the mother of the gentleman who
                    eventually got sent home had come for a visit, and she was on the beach with us
                    one day and things got around talking about the problems that were there and so
                    on, and wondered if the situation would better itself. And I told her hopefully
                    I thought so. I said, “But you know, I think there are some people here who hope
                    that maybe I might become so frustrated that I'm going to quit.” I said, “I've
                    never quit anything in my life, and if I go out of Guinea, I'm going out feet
                    first. I'm going to have to be carried out unless I am recalled by the
                    Department.” That turned out also to be good therapy. Now I have used the polite
                    term “therapy” to not dodge the issue and to be specific. When the decision was
                    made that the Deputy Chief of Mission was to be recalled, it put the fear of God
                    in all of the career Foreign Service people serving in the Embassy at that time.
                    After all, Washington had gone along with the request of the Ambassador, had
                    paid attention to the reasons for the change. There were others who were
                    wondering, “Is this going to happen to me?” In fact, one person came in on his
                    own free will to almost plead his case, which was unnecessary, but it struck me
                    that the individual must have had a guilty conscience and he must not have been
                    doing his job and there's no telling what he might have been doing behind the
                    scenes. But it wasn't necessary ever again during that tour of duty to have
                    anybody else removed from the scene. Now it's a terrible aside to make the point
                    that the gentleman's wife in this case was of no help to him, because she had a
                    number of problems which we don't care to mention. But some of them were very
                    obvious and became a source of embarrassment to her colleagues.</p>
                <p>Visiting Americans, you raised the question about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Senator Symington decided to include Guinea in his African itinerary,
                    December 1959. I was not concerned whether the Senator's reported presidential
                    aspirations motivated his African tour. The important thing was that he intended
                    to come to Guinea and he was the first high-ranking American to visit this new
                    African republic. He arrived fortuitously in December, shortly after President
                    Toure's return from his highly successful visit to the United States. The
                    Senator was accompanied by Attorney Fowler Hamilton, who became director of the
                    Agency for International Development for a period during the Kennedy
                    Administration. I was happy that the American Senator and his colleague were so
                    well received by the people of Guinea. President Toure and his ministers were
                    very pleased that an American senator and potential candidate for the Presidency
                    had seen fit to visit their country.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Senator Symington and I called on President Toure, and with my help as
                    interpreter, the two men had a lengthy and profitable conversation. The Senator
                    met and talked with the leading members of the Government during his three-days
                    stay. He asked very keen and penetrating questions during the Embassy briefings
                    and he gave evidence of a remarkable grasp of the situation in Guinea.</p>
                <p>Although the Senator was favorably impressed with the work being done by one
                    English language teacher, he let me know that he was concerned that only one
                    teacher had been sent in answer to a request from President Toure himself.
                    Senator Symington was dismayed to discover that terms had yet to be worked out
                    by the International Cooperation Administration which would enable some 150
                    Guineans to come to the United States to study under the terms of the October
                    1959 cultural agreement signed in Washington. Senator Symington was very
                    impressed by the fact that wherever we went in the official car with the
                    American Ambassadorial flags flying, Guineans, old and young, stopped to wave,
                    called out friendly greetings, and stopped to applaud. The Senator told me that
                    this was the first time he had ever seen this happen. I do believe that he must
                    have concluded, after three days of this kind of treatment, that the showing of
                    friendship was genuine and not something arranged for his visit.</p>
                <p>I saw press reports of a news conference given by the Senator upon his return to
                    the United States from his fifteen-day tour of African countries. His five
                    suggestions for strengthening the U.S. position and counteracting Communist
                    influence in Africa interested me greatly. He proposed one billion dollars in
                    American aid each year; fewer restrictions on the use of our aid funds;
                    increased exchange of American and African students, teachers and others to spur
                    education in Africa; expansion of American diplomatic and assistance missions in
                    Africa; increased training in African languages for Americans sent to
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The Senator expressed the opinion that in most of the free countries of Africa,
                    the Communist position was either equal or nearly as good as the American
                    position, but admitted that in a few African countries, the Communist position
                    was better. He called for better medical, better education and a higher standard
                    of living for Africans. In his report to the U. S. Senate on his Africa trip,
                    the Senator related the extremely favorable observations and the impressions he
                    had heard President Toure express concerning his 1959 visit to the United
                    States. He inserted in the Congressional Record, a message of thanks which Toure
                    had asked him to deliver to the American people and then said the following:
                    “Mr. President, during my recent trip to Africa, I had the great honor of
                    meeting with leaders of some of the newly independent developing nations of that
                    continent. None was more impressive than President Sekou Toure of the Republic
                    of Guinea. President Toure knows and understands the problems which an emerging
                    nation must face. He has the determination and foresight which I am sure meet
                    the challenge of the future in a manner that will benefit his nation and the
                    world. President Toure made a lasting impression on those who met him during his
                    recent tour of this country. This trip was an example of what can be done
                    between nations if there is a mutual exchange of ideas and plans. I hope that
                    there will be many more such visits and exchanges between our peoples and those
                    of African nations.”</p>
                <p>Fortunately for us, Senator Symington's interest in Guinea did not end with his
                    return to America. It is my understanding that he began to question the
                    government agencies about why so little assistance was being given to Guinea. He
                    cited, for example, one English teacher sent to a country with a population of
                    2.5 million people. And when he discovered that the 150 cultural scholarships
                    could not be granted unless the Guinean Government signed the standard ICA
                    bilateral agreement, he questioned the validity of a stipulation which penalized
                    innocent students.</p>
                <p>I remain convinced that the unflagging interest and good services of Senator
                    Symington had much to do with the securing of those thirteen American teachers
                    who came to Guinea to conduct the English language program during the summer of
                    1960, and with enabling forty-two Guinean students to come to America for study
                    in October 1960. What I have always regretted is that more Americans like
                    Senator Symington did not come to Guinea between 1959 and 1961.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for the United States, the presidential candidate, Senator John F.
                    Kennedy, had arranged to send Governor Averell Harriman to Africa on a
                    fact-finding mission in August 1960. Guinea officials did not conceal from me
                    their pleasure at the fact that Harriman was including their country in his
                    tour. Although the Governor came as a private citizen, he was greeted with the
                    pomp and ceremony afforded official visitors. The Guinean Government wanted
                    Harriman to occupy one of President Toure's guest homes, but he decided to stay
                    at the Hotel de France. As already indicated, the official Residence, which we
                    were occupying, had no facilities for visiting dignitaries.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>At the Governor's insistence, I was present at his meeting with the Guinean
                    ministers as well as at his meetings with President Toure and his Cabinet. I
                    made it a point, however, to see to it that Governor Harriman had the
                    opportunity to speak privately with President Toure at the buffet dinner given
                    in his honor at the Pr�sidence. It was during this dinner, apparently, that
                    Toure told his visitor that I was one of the most trusted and respected members
                    of the diplomatic corps in Guinea.</p>
                <p>The high point in the Harriman visit came during the meeting involving Toure, his
                    Cabinet, Harriman and myself. We had assembled in the Cabinet Room, upstairs in
                    the Pr�sidence. The meeting started on a humorous note. The Governor had
                    prefaced his remarks by telling the Guineans that he and I were good friends but
                    we had one major difference in that we belonged to different political parties.
                    Upon hearing these remarks, I half rose from my seat and with a perfectly
                    straight face offered to leave the room so that the Governor would feel free to
                    talk to Toure. President Toure and his Cabinet members, Governor Harriman and I
                    joined the hearty laughter that met this gesture, which had been understood by
                    all those present.</p>
                <p>I was proud to be on the scene that day to witness Harriman in action. He was at
                    all times direct and to the point and could be very blunt when the occasion
                    warranted it. He made no apologies for those things for which America stood. He
                    spoke the language easily understood and appreciated by Toure, who responded in
                    kind, and also revealed what was on his mind. There was no room for
                    misunderstanding during that meeting. We caught a glimpse of Harriman as he
                    might have been during his ambassadorship to the Soviet Union. All of us were
                    pleased with the meeting of minds. I had the opportunity to talk with Governor
                    Harriman for a few hours, at least four hours, during a combination
                    breakfast-lunch at the Pr�sidence the day before he left Guinea. We explored the
                    problems confronting the United States not only in Guinea but also in Africa in
                    general. I stressed my belief that America could make a real contribution to
                    Africa in the areas of health, education and social welfare.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the Pr�sidence, Governor Harriman graciously presented me with his
                    book, Peace with Russia, on the flyleaf of which he had written, “For John
                    Morrow with admiration for the fine job you are doing and many thanks for your
                    warm hospitality. Averell Harriman, August 1960.”</p>
                <p>There was no question in my mind that the visit of this man as a private citizen,
                    on a fact-finding mission for Kennedy, did much to improve the strength in
                    American-Guinean understanding. No propaganda pamphlets or television broadcast
                    could have done as much as Harriman had accomplished in his face-to-face
                    confrontation with Toure. Harriman did not share the fear expressed in some
                    quarters that Toure and his Government had gone over the brink. I received a
                    distinct impression that he understood that Toure was an African nationalist,
                    struggling to make his nation viable.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>It is my firm belief that the report made to presidential candidate Kennedy by
                    Harriman on his findings in Africa had much to do with the new look for the
                    better in African affairs at the State Department immediately after the Kennedy
                    Administration came to power in January 1961. It may be recalled that the first
                    important appointment made by Kennedy as President was that of G. Mennen
                    Williams to the post of Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. This
                    appointment was important not because Williams knew anything about African
                    affairs, but nobody knew better than the Africans that the new Assistant
                    Secretary of State knew very little about their affairs. Williams' appointment
                    was important because the President of the United States had seen fit to place a
                    man of his stature in such a post. It implied that Williams had the ear of the
                    President and once he could get his feet on the ground in the African arena,
                    much-needed changes could be expected in U.S.-African policy. Unfortunately,
                    subsequent events did not bear out completely these early hopes about the
                    significance of Williams' appointment.</p>
                <p>Returning to the question of the influence of the Harriman report, I do believe
                    that his recommendations very specifically effected a change in U.S. policy
                    toward Guinea after April 1961, when the Kennedy appointee to Guinea, Ambassador
                    William Attwood, reported to the Republic of Guinea. I was very happy for my
                    successor, Ambassador Attwood, that there was at the beginning this intelligent
                    appraisal of the Guinean situation and a recognition of the need to cast aside
                    outmoded procedures, techniques, and policies for dealing with the African
                    nations.</p>
                <p>I must admit this. The reception received by a group of distinguished Americans
                    that came to Guinea in the latter part of December 1960 differed sharply from
                    that received by either Senator Symington or Governor Harriman. The delegation
                    was made up of Senator Frank Church, Democrat, Idaho; Senator Gale W. McGee,
                    Democrat, Wyoming; Senator Frank E. Moss, Democrat, Utah; and Edward Kennedy,
                    youngest brother of the President-elect. Young Kennedy had joined the Senators
                    and their party for the last leg of their African fact-finding tour, much to the
                    dismay of some of the Senators. I have often asked myself why it was that this
                    last group of American dignitaries to visit Guinea during my tour of duty
                    received such a cool reception. I think the answer is to be found in the events
                    occurring just prior to their arrival.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>If it had been within my power to suggest a date for the visit, I certainly would
                    have put it off until a more propitious moment. I had been well aware that
                    President Toure and his ministers were very much irked by the role of the United
                    States delegation at the United Nations and the role it had played in seating in
                    the U.N. General Assembly the Congolese delegation sponsored by President
                    Kasavubu. The Guinean delegation at the United Nations had given all out support
                    to the rival Congolese delegation sponsored by their friend, Patrice Lumumba,
                    who had insisted that he and not Kasavubu was the legal head of the central
                    government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I was aware also that Toure
                    was very unhappy about the treatment received by a message which he had sent
                    directly to President Eisenhower, taking issue with Eisenhower over U.S. support
                    for the U.N. policy in the strife-torn Congolese Republic. Toure's implied
                    charges that the United States was allied with those nations opposing freedom
                    for the Congo and for other African states, had drawn a strong reply from
                    President Eisenhower, which was carried on the front pages of the American
                    newspapers on November 26, 1960. In the reply, President Eisenhower declared
                    emphatically that the United States had been in the forefront of those nations
                    favoring the emancipation of all peoples. Eisenhower asserted that the United
                    States had warmly welcomed the creation of the independent Congo and had upheld
                    the unity and territorial integrity of the Congolese Republic through the United
                    Nations and not by means of unilateral intervention in Congolese affairs. Toure
                    had sent a message to President-elect Kennedy also that he had received a rebuff
                    on this score, when Kennedy let him know that he too was supporting the stand
                    taken by President Eisenhower on the role played by the United Nations in the
                    Congo.</p>
                <p>It seems that Kennedy's reply surprised and nettled Toure, who had expected a
                    difference of opinion between Eisenhower and Kennedy. Toure reacted by carrying
                    out his December 1960 threat to recall Guinean troops in the Congo made during
                    the formation of the Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union and cabled the U.N. Security
                    Council that he was withdrawing four hundred more troops, four hundred troops,
                    that is, Guinean troops, stationed in the Congo because of the violation of the
                    U.N. charter by the U.N. force in the Congo.</p>
                <p>And when the American Senators and Edward Kennedy reached Guinea, President Toure
                    had not returned from an official visit to Sierra Leone. I had arranged,
                    however, for my visitors to see Toure on the following Monday morning prior to
                    their departure from Guinea. In the meantime, the word reached Conakry that an
                    attempt had been made in Sierra Leone to sabotage the helicopter, a gift from
                    the Soviet Union, in which Toure was traveling. It was reported that dirt had
                    been placed in the oil line of the helicopter and it had been necessary to fly a
                    second plane to Sierra Leona to return the Presidential party to Conakry. I did
                    not expect that this incident, if true, was going to put Sekou Toure in a
                    congenial mood for meeting Monday morning guests.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>It should not be difficult to imagine what happened when we arrived in the
                    Pr�sidence on that morning. First thing I noticed was that the guards did not
                    come forward to greet me with their usual alacrity. I summoned the guard and
                    asked him to notify the Cabinet Chief that my guests and I had arrived for our
                    meeting with President Toure and his Cabinet. I presumed the guard delivered the
                    message, for he went into the office of the Cabinet Chief. When he did not
                    return with a reply and the Cabinet Chief did not appear, I thought this was
                    somewhat strange. As the minutes ticked by and no one appeared, I told the
                    delegation members that I had begun to suspect that the delay had some
                    diplomatic implications. I had never waited to get into President Toure's office
                    before, whether I came with visitors or alone. My remarks brought the
                    observation from one of the more candid members of the American delegation that
                    they had waited a very long while in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) before getting in to
                    see Emperor Haile Selassie.</p>
                <p>Prodded by the thoughts that we had not kept the Guinean delegation waiting at
                    any of the appointments at the White House or at the State Department in the
                    fall of 1959, and by my determination not to have the Addis Ababa visitor wait
                    repeated in Conakry, I stepped into the hall and called the guard. I told him to
                    inform the Cabinet Chief that I had found it impossible to wait any longer and
                    was therefore returning to the Embassy with my guests. The guard turned in a
                    flash and sprinted up the stairs to the Cabinet Chief's office. Before I could
                    re-enter the waiting room to suggest to Senator Church, the delegation leader,
                    that we should leave, the guard returned to say that the President wished to see
                    us. As I climbed the stairs to the Cabinet Room, I was not sanguine about our
                    chances for a successful exchange of views.</p>
                <p>Upon entering the Cabinet Room, in which the ministers had already taken seats
                    around the long table, I noticed immediately that President Toure appeared tired
                    and was not his usual cordial self. I was conscious also of the absence of
                    banter usually exchanged among the young ministers. There was something
                    unusually solemn about this pre-meeting atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had I finished introducing the Senators and young Kennedy before Toure
                    launched into a lengthy discussion of Guinean history and geography. He skirted
                    the vital problems which he and I knew from past experience American officials
                    wanted to discuss. I suddenly realized that Toure knew that the delegation was
                    supposed to go directly from the Pr�sidence to the airport to depart for Dakar,
                    their last stop. I decided that he was deliberately using up time to avoid an
                    extended question period.</p>
                <p>When the Senators and Kennedy did get the opportunity to ask questions, the
                    answers given were not very relevant. It became obvious that Toure was not going
                    out of his way to impress these visitors favorably. I could see the implication
                    for the future if the American delegation had left with the feeling that it had
                    been impossible to get first-hand information on troublesome problems which
                    threatened American-Guinean relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>On February 12, 1961, there appeared in the United States a document reporting on
                    the African tour made by the U.S. Senators. The portion of this report devoted
                    exclusively to Guinea clearly precluded any possible implementation of the
                    bilateral agreement which the Minister of Plan, N'Famara Keita and I had signed
                    on September 30, 1960 in Conakry. I cannot say that I was surprised by this
                    report, but I was sorry that the conclusions had been reached after only one
                    meeting with Toure held under none-too-favorable circumstances.</p>
                <p>The report said in part: “There are indications that the performance of the bloc
                    in Guinea has not measured up to its expansive promises. We see no reason for
                    the United States to undertake to obscure this development or to assist any
                    Communist effort to make Guinea an example of what bloc aid can accomplish.
                    There are limits to our resources and too many African countries which need our
                    help and which respect our motives.”</p>
                <p>“Another issue causing us to advocate a wait-and-see approach is a recent
                    dispatch of large quantities of military supplies from the bloc. The implausible
                    explanation Guinea offers regarding its need for such arms, including aircraft
                    guns, anti-aircraft guns, concerns the purported discovery of arms caches in
                    connection with the plot against its borders. Pending clear evidence that Guinea
                    indeed wants our friendship and wishes to and can preserve its independence for
                    the bloc, we believe that the United States should maintain no more than a token
                    aid program just to keep the door open.”</p>
                <p>There, spelled out in black and white, for the first time, was the very policy
                    which the United States had been following in Guinea since 1959. Nobody had been
                    willing to admit this to me before even though I had sought through various
                    means to discover what policy had been set for this country, where the American
                    Embassy staff had tried unceasingly to establish mutual understanding. In my
                    estimation, it would have been much fairer had I been told this very frankly in
                    Washington before departing for Guinea. If it had not been possible to determine
                    the guidelines before my departure, at least I should have been told the day,
                    the hour, the minute the United States decided its policy! It was a matter of
                    record that we lived in hope; we never despaired; we never stopped fighting for
                    what we thought should be done to assist this developing country in its struggle
                    through a desperate and frustrating period.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The report made by the American delegation came as a result of its contact,
                    treatment and observations in Guinea. I hold Toure himself responsible for some
                    of the conclusions drawn. I think that he was most unpolitical and shortsighted
                    not to have made an honest effort to answer the queries put to him by Church and
                    his colleagues. He had everything to gain, nothing to lose. The press had
                    already printed all kinds of unfavorable things about Guinea — some true, some
                    untrue. He didn't have to worry about the exposure of skeletons in the closet.
                    He had only to slug it out as he had done with Averell Harriman and the Senators
                    might have been impressed by his forthrightness whether or not they agreed with
                    him. Instead, angry at the U.S. policy and the United Nations, provoked by
                    Eisenhower's and Kennedy's replies to his allegations, morose over the alleged
                    sabotage attempts in Sierra Leone, this young African leader stepped to the
                    plate in the U.S. Senate's world series. He did not go down swinging; he was
                    called out on strikes.</p>
                <p>Senator Church saw fit to insert in the Congressional Record, the appendix,
                    January 30, 1961, very complimentary remarks concerning my ability as a diplomat
                    and representative of the United States abroad. But Senator Symington had done
                    the same thing upon his return to America in the Congressional Record-Senate,
                    February 1, 1960, page 1512. My real concern was the knowledge after reading the
                    Church report, that tangible progress toward meeting the problems of human
                    suffering abounding in Guinea was not going to be made during the time that I
                    would be there.</p>
                <p>Oh, by the way, Deputy Undersecretary of State Loy Henderson came to Guinea in
                    the course of an October 1960 inspection tour of American embassies and
                    consulates in Sub-Saharan Africa. And although Henderson's visit involved
                    American business, strictly speaking, I saw to it that he got to converse with
                    Minister Abdourahmane Diallo, Acting President, in the absence of Toure. My good
                    friend, C. Vaughn Ferguson, served as the interpreter during Henderson's
                    conversations with Diallo. It is to the everlasting credit of Loy Henderson that
                    he did his best to secure for me the kind of administrative support which I
                    requested, but not even Henderson could overcome overnight the dearth of
                    trained, knowledgeable Foreign Service personnel in hardship posts in Africa or
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>We accompanied this twenty-one man party of American officials to the airport on
                    October 26, 1960. The guards waved us through customs with a smile and a sharp
                    salute. The passports had already been delivered to the departing visitors, so
                    we walked out to the waiting MATS plane. I asked the young Embassy officer once
                    again if he had checked to see that the passports were in order, and he answered
                    me in the affirmative. I stayed aboard the plane a moment to wish the delegation
                    a safe trip to Sierra Leone and a safe return to America. The plane took off and
                    was soon out of sight.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>An agitated and displeased commandant of the airport met me at the door of the
                    waiting room. In excited tones he explained that the Americans had left Guinea
                    without filling out exit visas and declarations of foreign currency. I told him
                    that this had been handled by the Guinean Foreign Ministry, and I had been
                    assured that all was in order for a smooth departure. I asked him to check with
                    the Ministry, but he insisted that the Ministry did not run the airfield. He
                    said he intended to instruct the tower to recall the plane. I assured him that
                    he was making a grave mistake, especially since his Government had welcomed
                    these distinguished visitors and had given assurances that all was in order for
                    their departure from Guinea. I suggested again that he would do well to phone
                    the Ministry. The commandant turned and walked toward the tower. Our
                    conversation lasted almost twenty minutes and I hoped that the plane was out of
                    range of the tower signal by that time. Within five minutes, however, the
                    commandant came strutting back to announce that the tower had radioed the plane
                    and the pilot had agreed to return. I told the commandant that not a single
                    American was going to get off that plane and set foot on Guinean soil and that
                    if he had anything he wanted to sign, it would have to be taken to the plane. I
                    told him that anybody who got on or off that plane would have to climb over
                    me.</p>
                <p>Twenty minutes later the plane landed. I went aboard and asked Loy Henderson why
                    the plane had returned, particularly since the Guinean Foreign Ministry had
                    handled the passports. He said the decision to return was made after a brief
                    conference aboard. It was felt that future American-Guinean relations would be
                    better off if the letters of the law were obeyed.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, two guards had brought the necessary visa and currency cards to the
                    door of the plane; these cards were filled out, stamped and returned to the
                    commandant's office. For the second time that day I bade the visitors farewell,
                    only this time I asked them not to return (laughter) even if they heard that I
                    was a prisoner at the airport. Everybody aboard laughed; the plane took off.</p>
                <p>I returned to the Embassy to prepare one of the stiffest notes that would be sent
                    during my tour in Guinea. This note brought back the quickest response ever
                    exchanged in Guinea. The Guinean note graciously apologized for the unfortunate
                    incident created only through misunderstanding on the part of certain
                    functionaries in the Ministry and at the airport. They reiterated the pleasure
                    on the part of the Guinean Government to have welcomed the distinguished
                    American visitors. Several days later I received a personal letter from Loy
                    Henderson with a dateline Monrovia, Liberia. He said in part: “Dear John, it was
                    a pleasure to see you during my two visits to Conakry. Please don't feel
                    concerned about our early return visit. It did us no harm and it may be that the
                    government of Guinea will be conscious of our desire to respect its
                    sovereignty.” (Laughter).</p>
                <p>I think perhaps I should say a word about a couple of U.S. delegations that made
                    visits to independence celebrations.</p>

                <p>Not long after the West German-Guinean misunderstanding, I received word from the
                    State Department that I had been designated by President Eisenhower to be one of
                    the representatives with the rank of special ambassador to attend the ceremonies
                    at L�opoldville in connection with the independence celebration of the
                    Democratic Republic of the Congo scheduled for the last three days of June 1960.
                    I was pleased with the assignment and looked forward to visiting this Republic,
                    which had been granted its independence so suddenly by the Belgian Government
                    after a somewhat confused round-table conference in Brussels. I was happy also
                    at the prospect of renewing my acquaintance with former Undersecretary of State
                    for Political Affairs, Robert Murphy, who was to head the American delegation to
                    the Congo. It will be recalled that Mr. Murphy had presided over the meeting
                    held at the State Department in the fall of 1959 during the State visit of Sekou
                    Toure. Mr. Murphy had been very helpful to me in ironing out certain troublesome
                    last minute details.</p>
                <p>My experience in Guinea made me wonder, however, how the Congolese experiment was
                    going to work out. I was concerned of the possible implications of the policy of
                    the Belgian Government in limiting the opportunities for higher education to
                    only a very few Congolese. The Belgians had thought, in all probability, that
                    their policy had prevented the awakening of false hopes in the minds of the
                    great mass of Congolese, who then remained more easily manageable. Under the
                    French regime, Guinea had been very far from the top of the list of territories
                    from which students could go to France for advanced study. Yet I had reason to
                    believe that even Guinea had had more students trained abroad than had the
                    Congolese.</p>
                <p>If the Guinean Government was experiencing so much difficulty in maintaining its
                    sovereignty and its independence, how could the Congolese Government expect to
                    be better off when the Belgians moved out? At this particular stage, the
                    Belgians might have been lulled into thinking that their continued presence in
                    the Congo was an absolute must, for they thought the Congolese would fail
                    miserably without Belgian technical and administrative skills.</p>
                <p>Mr. Murphy had reported correctly that there was a mood of hope in the Congo
                    before and during the independence celebration. But I personally found it
                    extremely difficult to accept this hope, especially after having lived in Guinea
                    for eleven months. Furthermore, I was unwilling to discount the serious
                    disturbances among the rival political and tribal groups in the Congo, which had
                    the earmarks of an uprising. What was clear before independence, and became
                    increasingly clear after independence, was that its leaders, Kasavubu and
                    Lumumba, were pulling in opposite directions.</p>
                <p>This had not been the case in Guinea on the eve of independence. Moreover, it was
                    well known even outside the Congo that Kasavubu was more the Belgians' choice
                    than Lumumba, who was a veritable thorn in the Belgians' side. It interested me
                    that the Guineans were so intensely for Lumumba, and I went to the Congo with
                    resolve to observe both these leaders closely with the hope of gaining some
                    insight into the Congolese future.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Of course, I realized the impossibility of unraveling the complex Congolese
                    situation during a three-day ceremonial visit. I did not have the foresight to
                    anticipate, however, that little more than one month later the Congo would be
                    torn with strife and slaughter and Belgian nationals would be fleeing for their
                    lives.</p>
                <p>I had to fly from Conakry to Dakar to meet the military air transport service
                    plane bringing the rest of the American delegation to the Congo. We reached the
                    airport in L�opoldville the following evening, not long after the arrival of the
                    official party from Belgium, and there was a great deal of excitement and
                    bustle.</p>
                <p>Among the Congolese officials on hand to greet us at the airport was Antoine
                    Gizenga whom I had seen in Guinea several months before when he visited Conakry
                    on the way back to L�opoldville from the Brussels round-table conference. At the
                    moment when Gizenga was shaking my hand, a photographer's flash bulb popped, and
                    I remarked jokingly to C. Vaughn Ferguson, who later was appointed Ambassador to
                    the Malagasy Republic, that I wondered what the State Department officials would
                    have thought of my being in such a picture two or three months before.</p>
                <p>There were no visible signs of the uneasy state of affairs that had preceded
                    independence, and the Belgian Government had gone to great lengths to prepare an
                    impressive series of inaugural events: receptions, dinners, luncheons, parades,
                    culture events and fireworks. I was particularly well received by Congolese
                    officials, which I attributed to my being accredited to the government of the
                    Republic of Guinea and to the high regard Lumumba and the other Congolese had
                    for President Toure. Some officials told me very frankly that they had never
                    before seen a U.S. ambassador who was a black.</p>
                <p>I noticed the name of Lumumba was conspicuously absent from the list of those
                    participating in the solemn ceremony of granting and accepting Congolese
                    independence. Indeed, the omission of his name made more of an impact than if it
                    had been printed in bold letters. Nevertheless, as delegate William Paley, board
                    chairman of CBS, and I sought seats in the crowded and impressively new
                    Parliament chamber, we had no inkling of the real drama that would be played on
                    that platform where we saw King Baudouin and the Belgian and Congolese ministers
                    quietly awaiting the opening of the morning program on June 30.</p>
                <p>King Baudouin, as was to be expected, made a brief, polite and tactful statement
                    relinquishing his authority to rule the Congo and granting full independence to
                    the former territory. President Kasavubu, with a grace that momentarily diverted
                    attention from his somewhat short and plump figure, accepted the authority on
                    behalf of his Republic in a tempered and well-delivered speech of
                    acceptance.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Thinking the ceremony about over, William Paley had just turned to say something
                    to me when we both saw a tall, thin, ebony-hued young man get up from his seat
                    on the platform and rush toward the microphone. When I saw the goatee, I knew
                    that this was Lumumba. The Congolese Prime Minister who had been left out at the
                    morning ceremonies, launched into a vitriolic attack on the Belgians, citing the
                    wrongs and injustices inflicted upon the hapless Congolese during Belgian
                    occupation. Lumumba had seized the initiative in this solemn moment and was
                    announcing to the world that he could not be silenced through the subterfuge of
                    omitting his name from the program.</p>
                <p>To say that Lumumba's precipitous action caught everybody by surprise —
                    Congolese, Belgians, visiting African dignitaries, Americans — would be an
                    understatement. All of us looked to see whether the King and his ministers were
                    going to leave the platform in protest. All of the King's feelings were clearly
                    visible and his ministers made no effort to conceal their anger and shock. No
                    Belgian moved. The hush which at first descended over the audience was broken by
                    hearty applause by Lumumba's followers. Lumumba, the wily, ruthless, fiery
                    politician was playing to the grandstand, but he was also making his bid for
                    power. And it was evident that he was not wanting for followers, if the number
                    of Congolese applauding had any significance.</p>
                <p>Lumumba's action that morning revealed his lack of common sense, propriety,
                    timing and judgment. Many Congolese and Belgians felt that their family
                    squabbles should be settled behind closed doors, not aired in public before
                    invited guests. The Prime Minister's act brought to the surface the instability
                    and rashness which would eventually be his undoing. It warned all those within
                    hearing that he was a man who was going to be dangerous in the in-fighting and
                    who would not hesitate to go for the jugular. Yet, Lumumba lashing out in some
                    of the most bitter French I have ever heard, expressed the hidden sentiments not
                    only of some of the Congolese listeners, but also of some of the visiting
                    African dignitaries as he castigated the Belgians for their exploitation of the
                    defenseless Congolese and for their avariciousness.</p>
                <p>As Lumumba turned to the microphone, the session broke up amid the loud buzzing
                    of excited voices. Outside the Parliament chamber I saw a crowd collecting
                    around Lumumba and soon heard the angry agitated voices of Congolese ministers
                    all trying to speak at once. This noise did not subside until a Belgian,
                    accompanied by a Congolese official, approached the group and spoke a few words.
                    The crowd dispersed and order reigned once again.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>At the crowded luncheon following the tension-packed morning session, a hush once
                    again swept the guests when Patrice Lumumba got up to speak. I looked at him and
                    wondered what else could he possibly have to say. I had underestimated Lumumba's
                    versatility and his ability to change position. Speaking in tones no longer
                    strident, wearing a somewhat subdued air, Lumumba proceeded to sing the praises
                    of those whom he had condemned one hour ago. He cited the constructive things
                    done by the Belgians during their regime in the Congo and concluded his
                    startling remarks with the hope that cooperation and understanding between the
                    Congolese and the Belgians would continue after independence. I left the table
                    and immediately went in search of a Congolese official whom I had met in Conakry
                    several months before. I asked him to explain Mr. Lumumba's conduct. The
                    official was reluctant to talk. He hastily explained, however, that the Belgian
                    ministers had told Lumumba and the Congolese ministers that the King would leave
                    L�opoldville that day if Lumumba did not retract his harsh accusations of the
                    morning. Lumumba seemingly had found it difficult to understand what all this
                    fuss was about, for he had merely repeated what he had been saying all the time
                    across the length and breadth of the Congo. Lumumba overlooked the fact that
                    formally he had not been talking in the presence of the King, a captive listener
                    on the occasion on the surrendering of the territory. Sekou Toure had likewise
                    spoken out one day in the presence of a distinguished visitor, General de
                    Gaulle. But on that August day of 1958, Toure had taken the calculated risk and
                    had spoken from a well-prepared text submitted in advance, so it is said, to the
                    French Governor-General of Guinea.</p>
                <p>I did not react to Lumumba at all in the same fashion in which I had reacted to
                    Sekou Toure. Lumumba puzzled me, it is true, but he did not impress me. I
                    respected Toure, but I could not bring myself to respect Lumumba. I might have
                    had more respect for him if, despite his blatant show of poor manners and his
                    lack of diplomacy, he had refused to recant and had stood by his bristling
                    statement of the morning. Toure would not have recanted; he would have gone to
                    perdition first. Naturally, I could understand how a politician under pressure
                    from the angry Belgian ministers and his conciliatory Congolese colleagues,
                    fearful that the King's departure would mar the celebration, might opt to
                    compromise.</p>
                <p>But to recant publicly, in such a humiliating fashion, after exhibiting such
                    defiance a short time before, did not, in my opinion, engender respect.
                    Lumumba's exercise in poor taste and political expediency caused me to think
                    back over the events of the two preceding days. I was faintly aware that
                    whenever King Baudouin appeared in public, President Kasavubu had always been at
                    his side, engaging him in conversation. In each instance, Lumumba had been
                    seated or standing off to one side. And every time a cameraman approached to
                    photograph the King and Kasavubu, Lumumba had edged his chair over to get into
                    the picture or had jumped out of his seat, rushed up to Kasavubu and engaged his
                    attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>This was not a matter of my imagination because these maneuvers had been repeated
                    too many times within 48 hours. I did begin to question how long a man with the
                    drive, ambition and amour-propre of Lumumba was going to allow himself publicly
                    to be relegated to a secondary position. After all, Lumumba probably had a sense
                    of history as well as an image of himself as a great leader.</p>
                <p>Oh, there's little point in conjecturing about what might have happened if the
                    Belgians and Congolese responsible for planning the celebration ceremonies had
                    given a more prominent role to Lumumba in the hope of dissipating the intense
                    rivalry smoldering between him and Kasavubu. This would have brought simply a
                    temporary truce. The roots of the problems went much deeper, and the Belgians
                    themselves must be held responsible for subsequent events in the Congo. It is
                    not necessary to hark back to the time when Leopold II, whose reign between 1865
                    and 1909 was characterized by industrial and colonial expansion, and whose
                    ruthless greed and condonation of very harsh treatment of Congolese in the Congo
                    free states then under his personal rule provoked international protests, which
                    led to this area's being ceded to Belgium in 1908. Nor is it necessary to
                    discuss the Belgian controlled Union Mini�re du Haut-Katanga, operating in the
                    Katanga Province that had once produced most of the world's supply of cobalt as
                    well as quantities of uranium, radium, copper, tin and diamonds. It's small
                    wonder that Moise Tshombe could not resist the temptation to secede with the
                    Katanga Province as his base of operations.</p>
                <p>The Belgians had not prepared the Congolese for self-rule. They had been
                    satisfied to keep the situation under control by playing one tribal group
                    against another, and many of the improvements in sanitation, roads, buildings
                    and so forth came about as a result of creating a more favorable condition by
                    the thousands of Belgian civil servants and business people living and working
                    in the Congo. The French had done somewhat the same thing in Guinea, for the
                    same reason, and when the freedom avalanche began to gain momentum in the Congo,
                    the Belgians gave in to the pressure, stepped out, not in anger as de Gaulle in
                    Guinea, but in panic. The United Nations could not find a satisfactory solution
                    to the mess which resulted from the poorly managed Belgium pullout.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>One footnote about the trip to the Congo. President Toure's half brother,
                    Minister Toure, and the Guinean Consul asked us for a ride back to Accra in
                    Ghana. And it had been previously decided that the military transport plane was
                    to land in Conakry instead of going to Dakar to let me off, and I had persuaded
                    the American delegation to come to the Residence for light refreshments, to be
                    followed by a quick tour of Conakry. When we landed in Accra and Minister Toure
                    and the Consul departed with their baggage, I learned from the American
                    Ambassador, who met the plane, that President Toure's plane had already left
                    Accra that morning. Within moments, Minister Toure reappeared — this is Toure's
                    brother, half brother, expressing apologies and asking if he might accompany us
                    to Conakry. I immediately wired ahead to let the Guinean Government know that
                    Minister Ishmael Toure was returning with us. I also suggested that he invite
                    all available Guinean ministers and Western diplomats to the impromptu gathering
                    at the Residence.</p>
                <p>As we circled the Conakry airport preparatory to making what was to be the first
                    landing of an American plane on Guinean soil, I could see a large crowd
                    assembled in the waiting room. With Minister Toure leading the way, we filed out
                    of the plane to find all the Guinean ministers and Western diplomats who were in
                    and around Conakry that Saturday, waiting to greet the minister and the visiting
                    American dignitaries. At the entrance to the airport we found a long line of
                    cars with a police escort. The American delegation was assigned seats in the
                    cars with various Guinean ministers and the procession made its way from the
                    airport to the Residence in Donka. After the brief reception we re-entered the
                    cars, drove through the streets of Conakry, and returned to the airport.</p>
                <p>It should not be difficult to imagine the bewilderment not only of my Western
                    colleagues but also of the Communist bloc diplomats at the unaccustomed sight of
                    Guinean ministers and American visitors riding together through the streets of
                    Donka and Conakry. With the slow pace and the open cars, there was no difficulty
                    seeing who was talking to whom. As somebody remarked, the United States got as
                    much benefit in good will for bringing Minister Ishmael Toure back from the
                    Congo as it did in opening a cultural center in Conakry.</p>
                <p>In November 1960 I was again designated by President Eisenhower to be a
                    representative with the rank of Special Ambassador to an independence
                    celebration. This time it was a celebration of the independence of the Islamic
                    Republic of Mauritania to be held in Nouakchott beginning November 27. On this
                    occasion the President sent just two of us, the other being Henry S. Villard,
                    the American Ambassador at Dakar. Ambassador Villard was sent as the President's
                    personal representative, which meant that he was the ranking member authorized
                    to convey to the Mauritanian President the congratulatory statement from the
                    United States and the personal gift of President Eisenhower.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The colorful ceremony that took place in Nouakchott, a city that had been
                    constructed literally in a portion of the desert, went off with smoothness and
                    precision that were admirable. A speech turning over authority delivered by
                    French Minister Debr� and acceptance speech by President Mokhtar Ould Daddah
                    were well received by the Mauritanians and visitors. Feeding the more than a
                    thousand visitors was a veritable tour de force made possible by supplies flown
                    in from Dakar and France. The parade featuring Mauritanian paratroopers in
                    camouflaged uniforms and soldiers in desert garb, mounted on camels, added to
                    the exotic setting. The friendly and hospitable Mauritanians had the knack of
                    making visitors feel welcomed. I regretted very much when their first effort to
                    enter the United Nations was thwarted. The Mauritanian Republic was finally
                    admitted to the United Nations in 1961 despite the opposition of Morocco, which
                    laid claim to a portion of the territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to the lessons that you learned from Guinea
                        and from Africa in general, when we talked about the initial problems you
                        had with your Embassy staff and how those were resolved, you made the
                        statement that after all there were a number of crises that we faced, and
                        the Guinean Government leaders weren't really interested in speaking to
                        anybody but the Chief — the Chief of Mission, the Ambassador — and not
                        anybody underneath him, so to speak. Could you talk a little about some of
                        those crises that stand out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: I mentioned the plot, the “complot”. When Toure was making these speeches
                    in public, we could call them harangues, which literally were speeches
                    condemning to death Ibrahima Diallo and El-Hadj Mohammed Lamine Kaba as well as
                    some other people, some in absentia. He was also asking for countries who
                    respected Guinean sovereignty to come forth to aid Guinea or to stand by in case
                    there were an attack. Now, why this tactic was employed is questionable, but it
                    was perfectly obvious that the United States was not going to step up and say,
                    “All right, in a time of trouble, we shall come to your aid,” which of course
                    was a gesture which had already been made by Czechoslovakia and Russia.</p>
                <p>And it was my duty to convey this information that we were working through the
                    United Nations and were not engaged in any unilateral dealings with the Guinean
                    Government. Ah, this is a real crisis point and I had to convey this message.
                    However, let me say this, that despite this concept of always wanting to deal
                    with the Chief, it was also a matter of an education process because in some of
                    the situations I would deliberately send the economic officer or the political
                    officer to one of the ministries wherever there was a problem, whether it was
                    the Ministry of Plan or Foreign Affairs, with messages to be conveyed to the
                    Government instead of always being present on the scene as if nothing could
                    happen unless I were present. Because you have to be able to delegate authority
                    and this is what I was trying to also convey to the young Guinean ministers, who
                    would sometimes call and say, “Well, we thought that you were going to ...” and
                    I would say “Look, I can't be everywhere at one time and run our shop in that
                    same fashion.”</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>The complot, I think, was one of the most serious situations that I could think
                    of and the incident about when the gates were closed. I didn't want to dwell
                    upon that too much, but actually the Admiral and his ship had been told not to
                    leave the port. There was an implication that the Guinean Government wanted to
                    investigate the question of the flags further, the plastic flags, but as you
                    well know, ships have to leave according to the tide and the tide was coming in
                    at a particular time that morning — during the early morning hours — the Admiral
                    felt in the middle. I told him to go ahead and make his departure and I would be
                    behind to face whatever music there might be.</p>
                <p>Now I didn't state this when I first talked about the question of what happened
                    when the LSD's brought the Guineans back to the Congo, but that was a serious
                    situation and it was felt that there would be repercussions. But somehow or
                    another it was turned off when I told the Minister Fodeba Keita that I wouldn't
                    want to have had to walk way out to the Camp Alpha Yaya with just two marines to
                    free our sailors and soldiers. The implication was that with just two American
                    marines, it would have been possible to free our sailors or soldiers had they
                    been arrested by the Guinean Government. Said in a joke but it carried its full
                    meaning ... Just off-hand, well some things which might be considered not too
                    important at that point seemed to threaten some members of our Embassy ... as
                    well as the Guinean Government, who were sort of on edge; everything seemed to
                    have been a crisis. In other words, I sometimes felt that the situation was
                    being overplayed by all concerned. It is true though that the Guinean ministers
                    sometimes were haunted by the fact that they couldn't say that something or that
                    something would not be done until it had been checked with Toure. If Toure were
                    out in the brush someplace, then that meant everything stopped. There's an
                    implication that something like this happened during President Carter's
                    presidency, where he was the type of person who wanted to oversee everything.
                    And it is impossible for a person in an administrative position with a huge
                    set-up like, for example, the United States Government or even a small situation
                    like the Guinean Government, for one person always to be able to handle every
                    situation. I would strongly suspect now that for some of the people who have
                    survived, who've lived, that there has been much more of this delegation and
                    decentralization than in the beginning, but the chieftain concept ...</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I just want to give a little summary to some extent that could be listed in the
                    way of what did I learn in the Guinean situation? I learned not only from the
                    people of Guinea but also of other African nations of their great hope for
                    immediate change. They wanted all the evidence of modern civilization, including
                    hydroelectric dams. They did not find it easy to forget the effects of
                    colonialism that had promoted race and class discrimination. And I found out too
                    that Africans still looked to America for support because of their intrinsic
                    belief that America was the land of the original anti-colonial people — this
                    notwithstanding America's own racial problem. I'm not being immodest when I
                    confess that one of the most stimulating experiences in my life was that
                    opportunity to have served under President Eisenhower as the first American
                    Ambassador to the first French West African nation to achieve independence from
                    France. And my tour of duty was from July 1959 to March 1961. It was indeed a
                    challenge to have served at the United Nations under the Kennedy Administration
                    where I had the unique chance to work with the late elder statesman and
                    diplomat, Ambassador Adlai Stevenson. If time permits, I might have a footnote
                    to add about the U.N. experience.</p>
                <p>I shall not soon forget having been sent to Paris by President Kennedy as head of
                    the American delegation at UNESCO entrusted with the difficult responsibility of
                    implementing the United States policy in that international organization with a
                    membership in 1961 of some 113 nations. And, in spite of the blot of the recent
                    thunderings of Watergate and serious questions being raised today about U.S.
                    foreign policy; in spite of the efforts of the Ku Klux Klan, for example, to
                    turn back the pages of history for blacks and other minorities in America.</p>
                <p>In spite of these problems, I still make bold to say these words once uttered by
                    the late John F. Kennedy: “Let the public service be a proud and lively career
                    and that every man and woman in any area of our national government be able to
                    say with pride and honor in future years, I served the United States Government
                    in that hour of our nation's need.”</p>
                <p>On the surface it appeared that Guinean-American relations had been improving
                    since 1962. And suddenly on October 30, 1966, President Toure ordered the arrest
                    of the newly arrived American Ambassador, Robinson McIlvaine, and one week later
                    announced the expulsion of 62 Peace Corps volunteers and their dependents. A
                    strong protest in the United States State Department brought about the release
                    of Ambassador McIlvaine in less than 24 hours. An unruly mob broke furniture and
                    windows at the Ambassador's residence shortly after his release.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>McIlvaine was called back to Washington for consultation but there was not an
                    outright break between the U. S. and Guinea. Fortunately, later reports out of
                    Guinea indicated the relations between this Republic and the United States did
                    improve markedly in 1968. Mutual trust appeared to have replaced suspicion, and
                    there seemed to be more mutual confidence and a willingness to let each to go
                    his own way. It is true also that the International Bank of Reconstruction and
                    Development agreed on September 18, 1968 to lend Guinea 64.5 million dollars
                    over a period of twenty-four years to help construct an 85-mile railroad from
                    the mines of Fria to a port that would be constructed along the Atlantic coast.
                    The United States made a loan of 21 million dollars in Guinean francs to be used
                    for defraying local currency cost of constructing this railroad. The Peace
                    Corps, expelled in October 1966, was invited back to Guinea and anticipated
                    sending some twenty or thirty volunteers in June of 1969. Two middle-aged
                    Americans ... American blacks from Detroit, Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Sharp moved to
                    Guinea in October 1968 to teach in the National Arts Trade School in Conakry.
                    Mr. Sharp taught welding, and his wife taught English. Mr. Sharp also set up the
                    first-class garage so sorely needed in Conakry.</p>
                <p>It would appear that Sekou Toure and the last of the original African
                    revolutionaries, are still paying lip service to revolution, deeming it
                    advisable to forego new economic links — to forge, not forego, forge new
                    economic links with the World Bank as well as the United States and the rest of
                    the world. Maybe he thought he would thus be able to put off a while longer at
                    least the fate of his most immediate revolutionary neighbor, Modibo Keita, who
                    was deposed in a military coup in November 19 of 1968.</p>
                <p>Then I received a disquieting letter from one whom I trusted and respected.
                    Starting out the expression “Plus �a change has always been the rule here in
                    dreamland,” he was talking about Guinea. “But this time I have a feeling ce ne
                    plus exactement la meme chose.” For six months we'd averaged about three mass
                    meetings a week. Almost daily section meetings plus numerous marches and
                    manifestations of loyalty for the President and, of course, national conferences
                    of Jeunesse, Femme, CNR, and the CNT. At all these meetings the patron, which
                    means, of course, the President, was eulogized with constant repetition of his
                    new titles, “Responsable Supreme de la R�volution” and “Serviteur Fid�le du
                    Peuple”. You must admit that they are modest and more modest terms than the
                    “Redeemer.” Furthermore, he also spoke at length at each meeting. Of course,
                    during this period almost no productive work was performed anywhere in Guinea
                    except at Fria, which probably didn't matter too much since the economy ceased
                    to exist some time ago. The strategy was obvious: He was going to keep everybody
                    so damn busy and distracted, no one would have the time to plot a coup. And one
                    of the distractions was a gem of fantasy. Border guards were doubled; all
                    security forces were alerted to be on the lookout for French paratroops
                    disguised as Americans looking for jobs with Fria.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Well, it worked, if, as I assume is possible, Colonel Diaby and others decided it
                    was time to stop all that nonsense. If that's what they decided, they sure
                    botched it. The tragedy is that the thirteen condemned to death, plus the twenty
                    to thirty put in prison, were among the most competent people we all knew in the
                    former group in addition to Diaby and six other militaires, Fodeba Keita,
                    Diawadou Barry, Karim Fofana Jilus, in absentia, Naby Youlah, and Mamadou Bah.
                    This was bringing it pretty close to home. I don't think any of them had been as
                    yet executed.</p>
                <p>Then too, the Patron has used the alleged “complot” to get rid of anyone who
                    might be a threat or isn't one hundred percent militant. This includes people
                    like Balla Camara, Doctor Marega, Baidi Goeye and Diop. “The second ranking
                    Guinean at Fria, Karim Bangoura, was scared to death but was still functioning
                    as Minister of Transport. The case of Achkar Marof is still a complete mystery.
                    As you know, he was snatched off the aircraft on returning from New York City
                    and put in prison. There was talk of his absconding with proceeds of the sale of
                    the Embassy at 73rd Street, but his wife, who was housed by Fodeba Keita, swears
                    she has all the deposit slips countersigned by Beavogui. I suspect Marof ran
                    into the same trouble as Telli Diallo. Because of the U.N. forum, he acquired an
                    international reputation and there is only room for one Guinean on the
                    international scene. Then too, he made the great mistake of not showing much
                    enthusiasm for returning home.”</p>
                <p>“So here we are again, Russians, Czechs, Yugoslavs, French, Americans, everyone
                    except the Chinese, pariahs once more.”</p>
                <p>Now, if that letter sounds like an exaggeration, I would like to just call
                    attention to a letter I received from the Secretary of State who at that time
                    was William Rogers, with the date of February 23, 1971. The letter might be
                    self-explanatory. “Dear Dr. Morrow, President Nixon has asked that I reply to
                    your telegram of January 25, 1971 urging him to request President Sekou Toure to
                    grant clemency to those condemned to death by the Guinean revolutionary tribunal
                    and to ensure the right of appeal to condemned as well as those sentenced to
                    hard labor.”</p>
                <p>“We have followed the recent events in Guinea closely, sharing the concern that
                    has been expressed around the world. We have felt, however, that to the extent
                    outside world appeals might be effective in the present circumstances, they
                    would more properly come from African nations and from other countries whose
                    nationals might be involved. Appeals were directed to President Sekou Toure by
                    Pope Paul, the President of Germany and several African leaders. As one of the
                    few Western nations still having effective relations with Guinea, we gave help
                    and advice where we could. We appreciate your concerning interests in matters of
                    this kind and that you conveyed your views to the President.”</p>

                <p>A letter dated April 25, 1977. “On the assumptions that all of you are willing to
                    try something to get our many friends out of jail, I submit the following very
                    hurriedly drafted telegram to be sent. Since the ROA anniversary comes early in
                    March and May, time is of the essence, so please call me with any suggested
                    revisions. Once we agree on the English version, I hope that it can be put into
                    proper French. I assume that you all recognize my reference to a long struggle
                    for justice and so forth to be rhetorical. S. E. Ahmed, Sekou Toure, Conakry,
                    Guinea. We the undersigned, former U.S. ambassadors to Guinea and Assistant
                    Secretary of State to Africa, long-time friends of your country and the people
                    of Guinea recalling your long struggle for justice and the rights of man, do
                    urge you to consider an amnesty for those still in prison that they may return
                    to their families. We suggest that such an action would be a welcome gesture in
                    celebration of the 30th anniversary of the ROA. John Morrow, William Attwood,
                    James Loeb, Robinson McIlvaine, Joseph Palmer.”</p>
                <p>The sequel was a document presented to the United Nations by the International
                    Day for Human Rights, a 300-page document — still I believe the date 1977. The
                    document concerned widespread illegal arrests, torture, starvation, murder of
                    political prisoners under President Sekou Toure's regime. The report was signed
                    by four former UnitedStates ambassadors to Guinea, including William Attwood,
                    publisher of Newsday.</p>
                <p>Not wishing to close on this tragic note, just a few observations about Africa.
                    Let's not forget that the United States national policy has been to promote the
                    self-determination of people. We are reminded often that America may be
                    considered the original anti-colonial people, and this country has been in the
                    vanguard for at least a half century in helping people achieve their national
                    independence. It is very easy to forget that Africa and colonialism, with its
                    race and class discrimination, made Africans keenly aware that they were objects
                    of inferiority. Many of today's African leaders are considered hypersensitive
                    and appear to be quick to point out slights due to discrimination. Some of these
                    leaders have been very suspicious of the West and the motives of Western powers.
                    Catapulted from second-class status to new positions of power, not always
                    certain of their new role, some leaders have reacted aggressively. In fact,
                    Westerners have gone so far as to accuse the Africans of being overly arrogant
                    because they seem to wear their newly won mantle of freedom in such a highly
                    assertive fashion. These people don't understand the African's position. They
                    explain much of the loud noises and boasting heard in Africa or in the halls of
                    the United Nations have been merely a symptom of the uncertainty and
                    inexperience in the ways of high-level, high-pressured, high-powered diplomacy
                    on the part of certain officials. With this in mind, they might say that one
                    might better understand the shouting of Tshombe — of a Tshombe who never had a
                    real chance of succeeding in his secession effort. This might help to account
                    for the actions of Jaja Wachuku of Nigeria, one-time self-styled spokesman of
                    the African bloc, who would attack U.S. representative Adlai Stevenson one day
                    and demand from the West the very next day unquestioning support for a seat for
                    Africa on the Security Council, and Economic and Social Councils, two of the
                    most important organs of the United Nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Never think for a moment that these leaders were not fully conscious of their
                    power, power derived not only from the fact that they were in control at last of
                    their destiny and had the strong backing of their constituency, but also because
                    of the strategic position vis-a-vis the East and the West. This sense of power
                    or the desire for power helped to promote a feeling of rivalry among some
                    African leaders, not only within the continent itself, but also within the
                    United Nations.</p>
                <p>President Toure of Guinea and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana may have talked about the
                    Pan-Africanism and they may have discussed with President Modibo Keita of Mali a
                    Ghana-Guinea-Mali union, but I'll wager that in the mind of each one was the
                    question, who ultimately was going to be recognized as a real leader of any such
                    formation? Anyone who has lived in Africa has had the opportunity to witness how
                    violently upon the emotions of his faithful followers a leader can play, with
                    the intent of accentuating hero worship. A leader expects the shouts and
                    adulation of the crowd even though he may make a show of dismissing such
                    plaudits with a mere glance or languid wave of the hand. President Toure, like
                    our present-day opera star, Pavarotti, used to keep a white handkerchief
                    available to acknowledge supporters.</p>
                <p>A certain American anthropologist advanced the view that African leadership views
                    the non-literate millions as children, who should be led in a political movement
                    directed and controlled much as one would look after growing children. This is
                    indeed a questionable theory. Whatever the case may be, some of these leaders do
                    consider themselves as the emancipators of their people from colonialism. They
                    feel that they are the guides to a better life. They are looked upon as the
                    fathers and protectors of their people; they act as spokesmen to the rest of the
                    world. The Sekou Toures, the Nkrumahs should not cause us to overlook a Leopold
                    Senghor, recently retired president of Senegal, an intellectual, former
                    professor, poet, philosopher, who expressed his concept of nationalism with
                    noble calm. He should not make us forget the Houphouet-Boigny, able president of
                    the Ivory Coast and former Cabinet member of President de Gaulle's Government,
                    and Hamani Diori, former president of Niger and former important official in the
                    Assembly Nationale, who was put out of office by a coup.</p>
                <p>President Tubman of Liberia was looked upon by some of the young African leaders
                    as an elder statesman of Africa. In latter years, President Tubman attempted to
                    place his best representatives in the United Nations, in Washington, and in
                    other strategic and difficult posts. In 1961, for example, one of his most able
                    men was a Liberian Ambassador to America, the Honorable S. Edward Peal, with
                    whom it was my privilege to work in Guinea. Ambassador Peal was greatly
                    respected by all members of the diplomatic corps in Guinea for his ability and
                    sincerity. It is my understanding that he occupied a similar position of esteem
                    in Washington in the diplomatic corps.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>President Toure never hesitated to play upon the emotions of the crowd. He made
                    certain, however, to maintain rigid order and strict party discipline. Nkrumah
                    made no effort to dissipate the God myth spread by his followers throughout
                    Ghana. However, the repeated assassination bomb attempts and Nkrumah's
                    reluctance to make public appearances later brought into question that so-called
                    god-like power of this leader, who was removed from office in 1966 during his
                    absence on a trip to China.</p>
                <p>Whatever you think and whatever you may want to think about the current crop of
                    African leaders in Africa or in the United Nations, it cannot be denied that
                    these men have introduced a new era. Some of them are going to develop into
                    eminent statesmen. There may be in their ranks at different moments some fools,
                    some demagogues, some fanatics. But let us admit it: similar individuals have
                    appeared already elsewhere on the pages of history. By and large, these men
                    today are helping Africa find its place in the new horizon.</p>
                <p>It is my sincere hope, from this time on, it will be possible to find in the
                    ranks of the United States Foreign Service dedicated black men and women who are
                    devoting their lives to the diplomatic service of the United States. This is not
                    to overlook the need for trained personnel in our government, our Peace Corps,
                    in the United Nations, as well as in other international agencies. The problems
                    and issues on the international front reach into the very roots of our national
                    life and constitute a sweeping challenge for us all. I still firmly believe that
                    it is possible for America to contribute to the image of willingness to try to
                    understand and to be of genuine assistance to all people who are striving to
                    help themselves in the difficult struggle against poverty, disease, inertia,
                    illiteracy, and despair. Some while back, I said if there were time, I would
                    give a footnote on the United Nations. Now, do you think that would be...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you like to do it tonight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Dr. Morrow, could you talk now, please, about the
                        time you spent as an alternate delegate to the United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, why don't I take you behind the scenes at the United Nations, as to
                    give some idea of what it meant to work with the late elder statesman and
                    diplomat, Ambassador Adlai Stevenson. It's not being done with any intention of
                    trying to add to the Stevenson lore, for much has been written and said already
                    about this nationally- and internationally-respected leader, who really
                    preferred to be called Governor rather than Ambassador. It's merely a matter of
                    presenting the observation of one who was on the scene at a particular moment in
                    history.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>To the surprise and possibly the dismay of those interested primarily in
                    patronage, on March 1, 1961, I was called from my post in Guinea in West Africa,
                    to which I had been sent by the Eisenhower Administration in 1959, and requested
                    by the newly-installed Kennedy Administration to report for duty at the United
                    Nations on March 7, 1961 as an alternate delegate with the rank of ambassador.
                    The Senate had to vote on this appointment by President Kennedy and therefore I
                    had to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under the
                    chairmanship of Senator William Fulbright of Arkansas, on March 6, 1961. In a
                    hearing opened to the public and to the press, I was asked many searching
                    questions concerning the Guinean situation and the American position there
                    vis-a-vis the Communist bloc nations striving to make Guinea their showplace. At
                    the conclusion of the hearing, my appointment was approved by the members of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting in Executive session and then was
                    voted and approved by the full Senate convened at noon that day, the vote of the
                    Senate duly authorizing my reporting for duty the next day, Tuesday, March 7th,
                    at the United States Mission at the United Nations, located in an office
                    building on Park Avenue, New York.</p>
                <p>A seat had been reserved for me at the staff meeting which placed me between Mrs.
                    Marietta Tree, who handled human rights, and the late Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt,
                    who sat for the Mission in the General Assembly. These two charming and
                    knowledgeable ladies were extremely helpful in orienting me into the ways and
                    intricacies of the United Nations. And I was greatly indebted to them both for
                    aiding me in my liaison work with Europeans, Africans, and Asians.</p>
                <p>Thus, it was that I entered upon a very challenging, rigorous, and stimulating
                    tour of duty under the skillful guidance of Adlai Stevenson, who led us through
                    a hectic session marked by heated debates in the General Assembly over U.N.
                    policy in the Congo. There were frequent attempts by the Soviet delegation to
                    harass Secretary General Dag Hammarskj�ld by interjecting the Troika
                    Proposition. The March meeting of the Security Council was called because of a
                    resolution calling for investigation of the suppression of riots in Angola by
                    Portugal and the famous April confrontation involving Ambassador Stevenson and
                    Cuban Foreign Minister, Raoul Raoul, over the ill-fated Bay of Pigs
                    invasion.</p>
                <p>I never worked with anybody who could accomplish so much in a comparatively brief
                    time allotted to daily staff meetings as Ambassador Stevenson. Yet all of us who
                    were delegates, or alternates — there were five delegates and three alternates —
                    had adequate and ever-present opportunities to express our opinion or offer
                    suggestions. I soon realized that Stevenson, with his dry deprecatory wit, was
                    not the kind of leader who drove people; he drove himself, and by his example
                    caused the rest of us to give only our best. No matter how difficult or
                    seemingly impossible the task you might be assigned, it was cheerfully accepted,
                    and most important of all, carried out.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I found it to be a tremendously inspiring opportunity to work with a statesman of
                    such boundless energy and enthusiasm who did not count the hours of days spent
                    in trying to make this a better world in which to live. I used to wonder,
                    however, when I saw Stevenson in action at the U.S. Mission and the Security
                    Council, the General Assembly, or just carrying through his heavy daily
                    schedules, just how long he could keep up such a pace. I knew that we were born
                    in the same month, on the same day, but with ten years difference in age. And
                    when I asked him one day in April 1961, after a session in the U.N. political
                    committee, how he kept going at such a pace, he answered, smilingly, that he was
                    just an old, hard-bitten politician who had grown accustomed to such a
                    tempo.</p>
                <p>Nothing that occurred during this 1961 session of the United Nations equaled the
                    drama, suspense, excitement of the March meeting of the Security Council and the
                    April confrontation of Stevenson and Raoul, mentioned above. I shall never
                    forget the utterly surprised and shocked expression on the face of the
                    representative to Portugal when Stevenson, asserting that Portugal should
                    accelerate immediately its step-by-step planning within its territory, for only
                    through such planning could advancement be made toward full self-determination
                    by those under Portuguese administration. Here was a spokesman for the United
                    States taking his stark position diametrically opposing those of its allies.</p>
                <p>Those listening that day interpreted Stevenson's speech as a positive indication
                    of a change in American policy fostered by the Kennedy Administration. Here was
                    the United States reaffirming through its U.N. spokesman, its belief in freedom
                    and self-determination for all people. This placed the United States in the
                    position of taking the side of the African and Asian nations on this issue. It
                    was indeed for me a strange spectacle to see the United States and Russia voting
                    on the same side of a question with the three nations, Liberia, Ceylon and the
                    United Arab Republic, that had sponsored a resolution calling for the U.N.
                    investigation of suppression by Portugal or riots in Angola. Surely Stevenson
                    was in his best form as he presented the U.S. position that day.</p>
                <p>For days after this, the U.S. vote, in the Security Council that is, the
                    corridors at the United Nations were filled with delegates discussing the words
                    of Stevenson which, according to the representative of Liberia, would
                    reverberate throughout Africa.</p>
                <p>In sharp contrast to this was the anguish and anger which those of us in the U.S.
                    Mission experienced when we discovered that Ambassador Stevenson had been
                    allowed to present faulty information in his April 12th reply to the charges of
                    the Cuban Prime Minister that Cuba had been the victim of outside aggression in
                    the attack on the Bay of Pigs and that the responsibility for this attack
                    belonged wholly to the United States. The Cuban Prime Minister's theatrical and
                    almost historical presentation followed the report that two B26 bombers, flown
                    by defecting Cuban pilots, had landed in Florida after inflicting damage in
                    Cuba.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Amidst the excitement and the tension created by the harsh words of Raoul,
                    Stevenson made his reply based upon information and photographs supplied to him
                    by Washington. Stevenson displayed the blown-up photographs of one of the planes
                    to support the contention that the plane belonged to the Cuban air force. He
                    asserted that the air force pilots defecting from Castro's tyranny had escaped
                    to Florida. He declared that no U.S. personnel or U.S. Government planes had
                    participated in the alleged raid. Stevenson concluded with a statement made
                    previously by President Kennedy to the effect that the issue was between the
                    Cubans themselves and not between Cuba and the United States.</p>
                <p>Not until after we heard Stevenson publicly make his eloquent statement to refute
                    the Cuban charges did the truth begin to leak out about the planes, the true
                    identify of the pilots, the supposed U.S. involvement through activities of
                    agents working outside of conventional Government lines. I saw a somewhat
                    chastened but dimly dogged Stevenson confront the Cuban Prime Minister once
                    again on April 17, 1961, to reply in solemn dignity to the Cuban complaint.
                    Stevenson reminded the U.N. delegates that many Americans had sympathized with
                    the cause espoused by Castro three years before and had given hospitality to the
                    Castro followers against Batista's tyranny, but, added Stevenson, these
                    Americans could not be expected to look with less sympathy on the Cuban struggle
                    against Castro's tyranny. In Stevenson's own words: “We sympathize with the
                    desire of the people of Cuba, including those in exile, who do not stop being
                    Cubans merely because they can no longer stand to live in today's Cuba. We
                    sympathize with their desire to seek Cuban independence and freedom. We hope
                    that Cuban people will succeed in doing what Castro's revolution never really
                    tried to do, that is to bring domestic processes to Cuba. As President Kennedy
                    has already said, there will not, under any condition, be an intervention in
                    Cuba by the United States armed forces.”</p>
                <p>I was very conscious that April day, as I listened to Stevenson, that his voice
                    lacked the accustomed ring of conviction. Not even this eloquence could remove
                    the doubt lingering in the minds of many listeners because of the previous U.S.
                    presentation of erroneous information. Nothing Stevenson could do then or later
                    seemed to overcome the psychological advantage of the Cuban Prime Minister's
                    theme, repeated over and over again, that the U.S. Government had exported war
                    to Cuba.</p>
                <p>I wondered why the Kennedy Administration allowed Stevenson to damage his
                    heretofore unquestionable credibility by repeating a false cover story to the
                    delegates of the U.N. political committee. I knew Stevenson always considered
                    Washington and consulted Washington before important presentations, to check up
                    on last-minute changes in the text. I rejected, therefore, any lame excuses
                    about a possible breakdown in communication between New York and Washington. I
                    believe sincerely that Stevenson had acted in good faith and without prior
                    knowledge that the data supplied him was faulty. I thought he would resign to
                    make clear to the world his feelings about the role he had then been forced,
                    unwillingly, to play.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>His failure to resign posed ... caused a difficult problem for those of us at the
                    U.S. Mission who considered this step, for the resignation of a member of the
                    Mission under such circumstances could have been interpreted as a lack of
                    confidence in and repudiation of the man, Stevenson. By remaining, the Governor
                    gained additional time for the U.S. Government to prepare for the crises that
                    loomed ahead, I don't know. History may one day offer the answer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Today is May 12, 1981. Dr. Morrow, last night when we were talking about
                    President Toure's visit to America, you discussed that at great length. I
                    understand there are some things you'd like to add.</p>
                <p>MORROW: Thank you very much. I already indicated that I had to get to Washington
                    before the trip started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, I'd been scheduled to arrive in Washington several days ahead of
                    the Guinean delegation to make sure that there were no loose ends to mar
                    President Toure's official visit. And in the midst of last-minute preparations
                    for the trip, I received word from Washington that an official from the
                    International Cooperation Administration was to arrive in Conakry the next day
                    to begin negotiations with Guinean authorities on the Standard Bilateral
                    Agreement. For more than three and one-half months, despite repeated queries, we
                    had remained in the dark concerning aid for Guinea. Now, four days before my
                    departure date of October 18th, word had come of the imminent arrival of an aid
                    official.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I knew the Guineans well enough to realize that they were going to be extremely
                    suspicious about any effort to negotiate an agreement so close to their visit to
                    America. They could easily believe that I had deliberately ... been deliberately
                    deceptive in not letting them know in advance that my country contemplated
                    approaching their government concerning an aid agreement. I was aware, too, that
                    the officials with whom we had to deal were making their own preparations for
                    the seven-nation tour with President Toure. I thought that the timing of the
                    arrival of the Washington official was extremely bad.</p>
                <p>The official arrived the next day and we spent the morning going over details of
                    the agreement which I was to present to President Toure that afternoon. I stated
                    very emphatically my objections to the timing and the purpose to his visit.
                    After reading through the statement, which I was seeing for the first time, I
                    warned that the Guineans were not going to be willing to sign it.</p>
                <p>The official felt that I was unduly pessimistic and said that the favorable
                    atmosphere surrounding the Toure visit to America ensured the success of these
                    negotiations. I replied that President Toure was willing to be more interested
                    in learning whether the United States was supplying a plane to transport the
                    Guinean delegation to Washington than in discussing the details of an agreement
                    at this time. I assured the official that nobody wanted to have an effective
                    working agreement with the Guinean Government more than I did and I pledged to
                    do my utmost to achieve one, despite my misgivings.</p>
                <p>The ICA official, my acting deputy, and I met with President Toure at the
                    Pr�sidence that afternoon. After presenting my colleagues, I thanked the
                    President for receiving us at such a short notice. I outlined the nature of the
                    proposed bilateral agreement and succeeded in getting Toure to agree to appoint
                    a working party to explore details. I requested a meeting the next day,
                    Saturday, since my departure was scheduled for Sunday. Toure indicated that the
                    ministers participating in the meeting would not be available until Monday. He
                    concluded the interview in his usual fashion by saying, “d'accord en principe,”
                    which meant simply that he had heard our propositions and the interview had come
                    to an end.</p>
                <p>The ICA official seemed very elated as we left the President's office and when we
                    reached the chancery, he wanted to send word to Washington that Toure had agreed
                    in principle to the terms of the agreement. I told him that I could not sign
                    such a message because it would give Washington the wrong impression. He
                    reminded me that Toure had said “d'accord en principe.” I said that the Guinean
                    President used this expression frequently in his conversations with his
                    ministers and with members of the diplomatic corps and that it was merely a
                    polite acknowledgment that the President had been listening. Toure would not
                    state any opinion on an agreement until it had been examined carefully by his
                    advisors. I also ventured to say that the moment Toure's advisors read the
                    clause pertaining to certain privileges for technicians, they would reject the
                    whole agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>It was fortunate that the original message which the ICA official wanted to send
                    to his agency never left the chancery. Negotiations started on Monday, October
                    19, 1959, came abruptly to a halt the following day when Guinean officials made
                    it clear that their Government would accept no agreement which encroached upon
                    their national sovereignty. They declared that they had granted no special
                    privilege to the Russians, Czechoslovakians, or Polish technicians and they had
                    no intention of extending special privileges to American technicians. The
                    American official was very much upset over the Guinean Government.</p>
                <p>When the word came through in Washington about the breakdown in negotiations in
                    Conakry I was not the least bit surprised. I was called into a hastily arranged
                    meeting with State Department and ICA officials. An ICA man told me that I would
                    have to return to Guinea and educate the Guineans on the ways of doing business
                    with the United States. I asked him to suggest specifically how one educated the
                    officials of a foreign country who charged that the insistence upon special
                    privileges for non-diplomatic personnel encroached on their national sovereignty
                    and felt that any pressure tactics constituted an insult to African dignity. The
                    official in question, who up to this point had been quite vociferous and
                    somewhat arrogant in tone and bearing, became silent.</p>
                <p>I left that meeting and I left Washington with a feeling of deep frustration and
                    bewilderment at the attitude of some of the officials in the International
                    Cooperation Administration toward Guinea in particular and Africa in general.
                    Among other things, I had detected an attitude that seemed to be: “Guinea will
                    either sign this agreement or else!” I got the impression that these officials
                    did not particularly care whether Guinea received aid or not. There seemed to be
                    a complete unawareness of the ferment on the African scene and of the fact that
                    all Asia, as well as Africa, was scrutinizing the United States-Guinean
                    relationship to discover whether the United States had placed a new priority on
                    Africa and at last was formulating policies that were responsive to African
                    realities.</p>
                <p>To be perfectly frank about it, during my entire tour of duty in Guinea, I
                    encountered only five ICA men who showed the understanding, technical expertise
                    and empathy absolutely essential for dealing with the oftentimes sensitive
                    officials of developing nations. I can remember the names of four of these men:
                    Jack Hood Vaughn, Marc Gordon, Bill Freeman, and John Canning. Unfortunately, I
                    cannot recall the name of the fifth, but I do remember that he spoke with a
                    foreign accent and was quite perceptive.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Jack Vaughn, who later left ICA — the best thing he could ever have done — to go
                    back to the Peace Corps, and later became Ambassador to Panama, Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Indian-American Affairs, and Director of the Peace Corps,
                    was particularly effective during his visit to Guinea, even though the Guineans
                    did not sign the agreement at that time. It was always my regret that the ICA
                    was unwilling to give Vaughn the rank or authority to exercise his good judgment
                    in negotiations with the Guineans. With the necessary authorization from
                    Washington, which we could not get, and with Vaughn and myself working as a
                    team, I believe we could have broken that particular aid impasse many months
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>I do not wish to convey the impression that I felt bitter toward the ICA. I was
                    well aware that there were others within its ranks during the period in question
                    who realized how important it was to prove to emerging African nations the
                    validity of the often-expressed U.S. commitment to help them develop
                    economically and politically while maintaining their sovereignty. Unfortunately,
                    these knowledgeable individuals lacked the authority to put their ideas into
                    action. Certainly the attempt to secure American technicians for countries like
                    Guinea was a very ticklish and difficult matter. Those who had the desired skill
                    and a speaking knowledge of French were usually reluctant to leave the United
                    States to serve overseas for a twelve- or twenty-four month period. Furthermore,
                    the conditions under which they might have to work and live in some areas raised
                    questions about health hazards as well as creature comforts.</p>
                <p>I can well understand why the ICA felt obliged to seek the very best possible
                    conditions, including diplomatic immunities, for all its personnel. It is a
                    fact, however, that other Americans not under ICA jurisdiction were recruited to
                    work directly for the Guinean Government by the African-American Institute. The
                    vast differences in pay and perquisites created an unfortunate atmosphere among
                    those Americans and others living under better conditions. Those who experienced
                    difficulties in getting promised compensation or housing, or who ran afoul of
                    customs because of an unwillingness to pay unexpected duties, were not in the
                    best frame of mind to perform their assigned task.</p>
                <p>A Guinean official at the Education Ministry summed up the situation by saying
                    that the only people who complained constantly about their working conditions
                    were the Americans. He contrasted their attitude with that of the Russians,
                    Czechoslovakians and East Germans, who supposedly accepted, without question,
                    the conditions in struggling Guinea. What this official ignored or did not wish
                    to acknowledge was that the Soviet, Czechoslovakian and East German technicians
                    had to carry out orders that came from above. American technicians were free to
                    stay or leave, and several did leave without giving notice.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Fortunately for our standing abroad, the Peace Corps later proved conclusively
                    that Americans could go into any country in the world without deep freezers,
                    rugs, and other outward signs of modern civilization and perform as effectively
                    as people from any other country. Peace Corps members did much to remove the
                    idea that Americans always clamor for special privileges and complain about the
                    disgracefully low level of foreign culture and civilization. In fact, the
                    excellent volunteer group of students known as Operation Crossroads, sponsored
                    by Rev. James Robinson of New York and chaperoned in Guinea in the summer of
                    1960 by the Rev. William Coffin, Yale University chaplain, really paved the way
                    for the Peace Corps in Africa.</p>
                <p>I did wonder at times, however, what agency actually exerted the most influence
                    on the foreign policy of the United States. It often appeared to me that the
                    ICA, responsible for the outlay of huge sums throughout the world, was making
                    the State Department play second fiddle in decision making. This might not have
                    been true of American dealings elsewhere in the world, but it seemed to be the
                    case, at least as long as I was in Guinea.</p>
                <p>And to digress for just a moment, I mentioned Rev. Robinson's group and the fact
                    that Rev. William Coffin was the chaperone or the guidance counselor, if you
                    will, during that period in Guinea. I must say that Bill Coffin did a most
                    effective job in gaining rapport between the Guineans and his group. And not
                    only Coffin; there was a young lady, Marie Gadsden, who came to teach English,
                    who also did an excellent job in establishing rapport as well as teaching
                    English to the Guineans and others who were interested in trying to learn that
                    language. And the pity is that we couldn't have had more Bill Coffins, and more
                    Marie Gadsdens coming into a situation as difficult as the Guinean situation
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did they stay there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: The Peace Corps was there for the summer and Dr. Gadsden had a somewhat
                    extended stay in Guinea. And the interesting thing about it is at first there
                    was great suspicion about this group that had come there to work, not to study,
                    but to work. And the Guineans probably placed their most astute, shall we say,
                    individuals among this group and discovered that some of those youngsters didn't
                    even seem to know too much about even United States politics and the American
                    Government. And when they discovered that they felt more at ease because they
                    decided, well, these folks are here on the level; they are not here to spy and
                    there was excellent rapport between the Guinean youth and the American
                    youth.</p>
                <p>It was a mixed group, but predominantly a white group. There were some American
                    blacks in the group and they certainly did an excellent job in proving to the
                    Guineans that there were some genuine Americans who really were concerned and
                    really wanted to help. Thank God they showed up at that time in history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of work did they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: The work consisted of trying to help construct schools. As a matter of
                    fact, it was all sort of laboring work, the same type of thing that I did when I
                    went to France in the summer of 1947 and went down to a place called Chambon to
                    help dig ditches for a foundation for what was to be a schoolhouse and also for
                    surrounding buildings. These people were actually doing laboring work, manual
                    labor, anything which was necessary for the cause. It was most interesting to
                    see them. By and large college students, and some, I'm sure, who had never done
                    any strenuous kind of work before nevertheless threw themselves into this
                    activity.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORROW: That's what I understand. Not like always in a little group or cluster,
                    which is the good old American way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was the forerunner of the Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: In my estimation, the success that Coffin and Rev. Robinson had in this
                    venture in Guinea, sold the bill of goods to the people of the United States who
                    felt it never would work. When I heard about it, I got very excited and because
                    I had such great respect for Rev. Robinson, having known him before I ever went
                    to Africa, I definitely wanted to give this group a chance. But there were some
                    people back in Washington who had great misgivings about what might happen to
                    the group, with its dire consequences.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the speculations about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, first their speculation was that they would only be there two or
                    three days and be thrown out ... But that didn't happen to them (laughs). But I
                    should mention at this point it did happen several years later in connection
                    with a Peace Corps group, but by then, as I've indicated previously, the
                    conditions had changed, altered greatly.</p>
                <p>And then they felt some might suffer injury; some people have very odd ideas
                    about Africa. I had mentioned it before, but I can recall a man in one of the
                    banks in New Jersey, I won't mention the name of the bank or the man, who
                    vehemently suggested to me that under no circumstances should I take my family
                    with me to Guinea. And yet by having taken my family, that was the thing that
                    gave the Guineans confidence that, gee, these people must be on the level;
                    they're all here in a group. I'm not saying, you know, the myth about wild
                    animals, I never saw any stalking around in (laughs) ... in throughout the
                    terrain of Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That group of Peace Corps workers that were thrown
                        out...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: That's, that's after my ... after I was there. And the circumstances, of
                    course, were extremely difficult at that point, because it seems that a plane
                    bearing some Guinean officials had been stopped in Ghana and they had been taken
                    off, literally seized, and the accusation was that the United States was behind
                    this and that's the reason why McIlvaine was arrested. I just mentioned merely
                    at one point that he had been arrested — I forgot the date I gave you — and was
                    released about twenty-four hours later after strenuous negotiations with
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>The truth is that the Guineans felt that the Americans had something to do with a
                    plot which embarrassed their officials, and, actually, nobody knew anything
                    about it. McIlvaine was a new person arriving on the scene and he was the victim
                    of circumstances.</p>
                <p>The situation at the house — I didn't go into detail — was quite a scary one for
                    his wife and children, however, because they were out there alone in Guinea,
                    since McIlvaine was under arrest, when this mob descended on the Residence where
                    we had once lived. But one difference is that after we had departed they had put
                    a second floor on, so it was a much larger Residence. And, fortunately, some
                    militia people and the cook and several other folks were able to keep the mob
                    from doing injury to Mrs. McIlvaine and her children; otherwise, that would have
                    been a very tragic situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>When we were there, there was never any indication of that. Several of the
                    residences were broken in and pilfered; nobody ever touched our residence. It
                    wasn't because we could say we had wonderful guardians, because the guards on
                    duty had no bullets for their rifles and they asked me would I please go and ask
                    the President or go over to the camp to get them some bullets. I actually made
                    the trip but I wasn't successful in getting them.</p>
                <p>I will say that our guardian had a machete, a very trusty weapon, and I
                    discovered that when I had to make this trip from Africa to the United States,
                    and left my wife and children there, this guardian put a cot at the gate and
                    slept there every night with his machete. This is what I was told by the
                    soldiers when I came back. Two soldiers were on guard but the guardian decided
                    that his presence was very necessary, and I though that was extremely loyal ...
                    loyal service on the part of an individual.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree. Is there anything else you'd like to add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Maybe a point or so about the agreements, as I have brought it up that
                    the negotiations had broken down. Whatever may be said to the contrary, the
                    Guinean Government remained unwilling to sign the standard ICA agreement, in the
                    form originally presented in the fall of 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What form was it in? Was that the one presented
                        originally...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Originally, yes, asking for all of the special treatment — technicians.
                    The document signed finally by the Minister of Plan, Keita, and myself in
                    Conakry on September 30, 1960, was the outgrowth of prolonged and frustrating
                    negotiations in Washington as well as in Conakry. The signing ceremony was
                    witnessed by Guinean reporters and one French reporter and photographer. A
                    release concerning the agreement appeared in the Agence Guin�enne de Presse but
                    no publicity was given it in America until an enterprising reporter of the New
                    York Times, Dana Adam Schmidt, got word of it a month or so later. And as a
                    result of his prodding, a spokesman for the State Department ICA admitted that a
                    bilateral agreement had been signed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>MORROW: I never did understand this reluctance to admit that the agreement had
                    finally been concluded, and the reluctance probably lay in the fact that they
                    had to water down the section on special privileges for technicians and come
                    across with an agreement which much more resembled a very sensible agreement
                    that the British had always had in operation in Guinea and had thus been
                    successful without all of this frustration. I think that there was anger and
                    pique and embarrassment on the part of ICA that they had lost the battle, and a
                    feeling that the blacks, and when I say the blacks I'm talking about the
                    Ambassador from America as well as the Guineans, had won the battle.</p>
                <p>The bilateral agreement was considered very significant by members of the
                    diplomatic corps in Guinea, who had come to believe that the United States and
                    Guinea would never reach a meeting of minds. It was considered so significant by
                    the Soviet Union that it called Ambassador Solod home two days later. When the
                    Soviet Ambassador returned to Guinea, it was announced that Soviet engineers
                    were to arrive soon to begin work on the railroad connecting Conakry and Kankan.
                    The Soviet authorities did not know, but I had reason to believe that the
                    agreement between Guinea and the United States would not be implemented during
                    my remaining months of tour of duty in Guinea, and it wasn't. I had hoped that
                    the United States was going to assist in the construction of the Konkour� Dam,
                    not because I wanted Toure to have a prestige project, but because I felt that
                    such a dam was necessary for the further development of industry in Guinea. I
                    felt that Toure was as good a risk as Kwame Nkrumah any day and he was much more
                    forthright. Nkrumah had received American aid for his Volta Dam project and any
                    hope that Toure might have had to strengthen the possibility of American support
                    for the construction of a dam on the Konkour� River to provide electric power, a
                    project already seriously considered by the French, was not realized.</p>
                <p>I was frequently asked by visitors in Guinea, official or non-official, what was
                    wrong with relations between the United States and Guinea. I could have answered
                    this question merely by stating that it was invariably a long drawn out process
                    to establish good relations between two such different nations. This would have
                    been dodging the issue. It was closer to the truth when I replied that Africa
                    had not been on the U.S. priority list until fairly recently. I felt that the
                    awareness in U.S. governmental circles of the situation developing in Africa had
                    come as much from development in the United Nations as from reports from African
                    capitals, reports which all too frequently were ignored or were acted upon too
                    late.</p>
                <p>In the United Nations there had been a marked increase during 1960�1961 in the
                    number of African nations that had become member states. The articulate
                    delegates from Africa insisted that powerful nations belonging to the United
                    Nations support rather than thwart the role of the U.N. in aiding ... Africa's
                    revolution to achieve success, in as peaceful and just a manner as possible. The
                    United States was finding it increasingly difficult to secure the support of
                    African and Asian nations for U.N. measures in which it was particularly
                    interested. But nobody seemed to be connecting development at the United Nations
                    with United Nations policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I just mentioned in passing having gone from Guinea to the United Nations; what I
                    did not say was that just shortly prior to my arriving there, there had been an
                    uprising in the Security Council on the part of the Black Panthers of New York
                    that had quite frightened the Security Council. When I arrived there and
                    assessed the situation, at one time I let Stevenson and some of his colleagues
                    know that I had been sent there probably to keep the peace. I assured them that
                    there'd be no further uprisings during the time that I was at the U.N. They
                    looked at me quizzically and I said, “You forget that when President Toure came
                    to America he visited New York and made a talk to the people of New York, and
                    that meeting was disturbed because of the fact that a member of the NAACP
                    (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) got up to try to
                    make a speech and was booed down, and the Guinean delegates at first thought
                    that this was some kind of show against their President. And I reassured them,
                    no, this was an American way of showing displeasure of something.</p>
                <p>The point I want to make is, though, that Toure and his group were predominantly
                    Muslims and they decided that anybody who had association with Toure must be all
                    right. And since I had spent almost two years (laugh) in Guinea and then had
                    been immediately brought by Kennedy, of another political party, to the U.N., it
                    was to save Stevenson and his group. So this was, of course, said in a joking
                    fashion. But then nobody ever bothered us the whole time that I was out there.
                    There were no disturbances on the part of the people from Harlem in trying to
                    break up proceedings in the United Nations. So there might have been more truth
                    in this than met the eye.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're right. (Laughter). Shall we talk about your

                <p>MORROW: Hackensack was a little town across the river from New York and people
                    used to always laugh when they heard the name. As a matter of fact, it used to
                    be heard on the vaudeville stage in the olden days. Hackensack and Hoboken;
                    these were always causes for laughter. I can recall one time in high school
                    making a statement to a chap, Earl Miers, who later became one of the directors
                    at Rutgers Press: “Earl, let's put this damn town on the map some day.” This was
                    just a joke in high school, but to double back. The interesting thing about
                    Hackensack was that it had an excellent school system. At that time, a grammar
                    school and high school, and a number of the teachers in both of these schools
                    had come from New England. They were dedicated individuals, well trained in
                    their various studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in Hackensack?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: I was born in Hackensack and way back, February 5, 1910. The interesting
                    thing is the fact that neither my dad nor mother went to college. They had come
                    originally from the South; my mother originally from Virginia, my father
                    originally from North Carolina. His father was a Presbyterian minister and was
                    trained by the Presbyterian Church. My dad did not wish to be a Presbyterian
                    minister, so he had left home early. If he'd stayed, he probably could have been
                    educated in the same fashion as his own father.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, both parents had a great respect for education and in some
                    miraculous fashion they were able to instill that in the five children of the
                    family. There were two older brothers, older than I: one, of course, now
                    deceased; a sister older than I; and a brother younger than myself.</p>
                <p>I think one of the outstanding events in my life, and I have to mention it at
                    this point, came around 1923 when my sister applied to teach in the Hackensack
                    school system. She'd gone to Montclair State Normal School and later on went on
                    to Columbia to get her master's degree. But for a black person to apply, and at
                    that point in time, in a town like Hackensack, created a great deal of
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>To be frank about it, the Ku Klux Klan even burned a cross in our backyard in
                    response to someone's trying to break into “our” school system. Also, strangely
                    enough, among the black folks in Hackensack, there were people who felt that the
                    Morrows were kind of getting out of their place, if there is such a thing in
                    quotation marks as a “place”. I won't go into the long drawn out negotiations,
                    but my sister did finally get a job in Hackensack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little about how she did it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MORROW: In the beginning, to discourage her ... well, what I should say was,
                    strangely enough, she had done her practice teaching in Hackensack earlier in a
                    school called Broadway School down in the predominantly Italian population.
                    Nobody paid any particular attention to the fact that there was a black girl
                    teaching in Union Street School, during her period of practice work for
                    Montclair State Normal School. But as soon as an application for a job got into
                    the picture, the newspapers added that New York reporters of the New York Times
                    were appearing on the scene, the Herald Tribune, in this little town to find out
                    who were these folks who lived in that little house on Berry Street who are
                    trying to break the color line. What were their objectives? What was behind it?
                    My father's and mother's quiet feelings were that the young woman is qualified;
                    she's a product of this school system, all right.</p>
                <p>At first, they tried to put her in a building which was next to, adjacent to
                    State Street School, and I don't remember all the details, whether they had all
                    black students in there or whether they had a mixture of blacks, Hispanics and
                    Italians. I know there were no students from off the hill, what we call off the
                    hill where the rich ... not in her first classes. Now this was supposed to
                    discourage this young woman and somebody would say, you see, you are setting up
                    a black discriminatory policy by this because you want a job.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, there was a man by the name of Stark, who originally had come from
                    New England. Stark felt that my dad was correct in trying to get a job for his
                    daughter, who had excellent marks throughout the Hackensack high school system
                    and throughout normal school. And he backed her to the hilt. To make a long
                    story short, she got broken into the system and a point had come where she would
                    be able to move without always having any kind of stigma involved, but this was
                    a slow process. And I can recall being in an English class in Hackensack High
                    School as a sophomore and the teacher prefacing the class with a remark, which
                    wasn't relevant to the lesson whatsoever, by saying, “It's a pity that there are
                    always some people who are trying to get in where they don't belong.” And even
                    though I was young and dumb, I sort of felt it must have something to do with me
                    or with somebody in my family.</p>
                <p>Now, the strange thing about this system in HackensacHackensack did not have a
                    segregated school system — but strangely enough, as I went through school I
                    would always be the only black in the class. I was the only black in Hackensack
                    High School in the academic division, which meant you were preparing for
                    college. I think the same thing was true of my brother, E. Frederick, who
                    preceded me, and who, incidentally, had been one who really made the record
                    wherever he went ... was an organizer for the NAACP, took all the chances when
                    he was in the army to help integrate and, of course, got into a great deal of
                    difficulty by trying to integrate the segregated United States Army; then later
                    on he became the first black to become an assistant to the President of the
                    United States and eventually became a vice president for international affairs
                    with the Bank of America.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Well, my brother and sister were really the people who showed the way. All I had
                    to do, in theory, was to follow in the wake, which, of course, was very
                    difficult because I was constantly being reminded, “Oh, you know your sister,
                    Nellie;” “Oh, you know your brother, Frederick;” “Oh, you know your brother,
                    Gene,” who preceded all of us.</p>
                <p>Now, in Hackensack High School there was a wonderful teacher by the name of Miss
                    Bennett, God bless her soul, who was a mathematician. For some reason or
                    another, Miss Bennett took an interest in me and I took an interest in
                    mathematics. Maybe it was luck, or whatever it is, that I got excellent marks in
                    mathematics throughout my high school career as well as excellent marks in
                    languages: Latin and French. Miss Bennett is the one who convinced me to take
                    the scholarship exams for Rutgers University, exams which were given over a
                    period of, if I recall, two days in a town called Ridgewood. And I had to get on
                    a bus for the first time and leave home and go all the way over to Ridgewood,
                    which was the so-called rich section of New Jersey, to go in this high school
                    alone to take exams for something that I couldn't understand what was the point
                    in doing it. You see, at that time I had ideas, oh, how I would like to go to a
                    place like Harvard. How could it ever possibly have been with the little bit of
                    money that my dad made as a custodian at the public library in Hackensack?</p>
                <p>I should mention that my dad was a Methodist minister. He had gotten his license
                    but the church was so small he couldn't support a family on that and so he had
                    to work. And that's important, because we came up with the concept that hard
                    work was honorable, and strange enough, that was a saving grace.</p>
                <p>Of course, I may be getting off the track, but through hard work, carrying ice, I
                    was able to get enough money to help me with things like board at Rutgers
                    University for the four years — because I had learned that you're supposed to
                    work. I used to help my dad down at the library; helped cut the grass, which was
                    a huge setup. And at that time we didn't have any machines with motors to it;
                    you had to be the motor. That's how you could work. Work was honorable; nothing
                    of disgrace in that, and that's very important.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, to get back to Ridgewood, the Rutgers and State University used to give
                    fifty scholarships to people throughout the state who could pass a rigorous
                    two-day examination; all sorts of subjects. It's just like a college entrance
                    examination. And I took this exam, because Miss Bennett insisted on it, and came
                    away feeling, I'm never going to hear anything from this. Went on, got on my ice
                    truck and one day when I came home for lunch my mother met me at the door and
                    she was crying. Then it frightened me and I said, “What's the matter? What's the
                    matter?” She said, “There's ... there's a letter here from Rutgers.” I said,
                    “Well, what is it? Well, open it; please open it.” And I opened that letter and
                    it said, “You have been awarded a four-year scholarship.”</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>My mother really did cry. But the real impact of that was lost upon me at the
                    time. And I realized that if that word had not come in that fashion, in that
                    letter, because of the problem, financial problem of my family at that time, I
                    don't know whether I ever would have been able to go on to college. For my
                    brother, when he finally went to college, he first went to Lincoln and he
                    changed to Bowdoin, and he would have to stop and work; work a half a year or
                    sometimes work a full year; interrupt his college career in that fashion,
                    struggling, and he hadn't even finished.</p>
                <p>And it was difficult to think in terms, now here comes another person along that
                    would have to be helped. Fortunately, this was as if God had given it to us, and
                    I've always had that feeling. So by dint of hard working each summer and with
                    that fellowship, it was possible for me to go to Rutgers. Let's get to Rutgers.
                    I don't know if there's any interest in hearing about Rutgers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, this shows the influence of a family which felt that religion and a
                    closeness of family were important. As a matter of fact, I can recall many years
                    later when someone asked me, “Can you give any reason why you were able to move
                    along in life?” I came up with a statement which I can mention now and then I'll
                    very quickly go through this with Rutgers and Penn.</p>
                <p>“Brought up in a period overshadowed by discrimination and depression, my life
                    was influenced greatly by religious parents who had intrinsic faith in God,
                    education, and the future possibility for advancement of all people in America
                    regardless of race, creed or color. Any success I may have achieved may be
                    traced to the guidance of my parents, the support given my efforts by my wife,
                    and the willingness on my part to work hard, sacrifice, and never, never lose
                    hope.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to, before you go along, mention just for the
                        record that you were just reading that from the 1980-1981 Who's Who in
                        America and there's an extraordinary statement. And I don't think I've ever
                        seen that kind of a statement in a Who's Who volume; it's just not done.
                        Basically what you have in Who's Who are the biographical data, but nothing
                        like this. And I was very much impressed when I read it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MORROW: Well, it's just through sheer chance because I received a request from
                    Who's Who a number of years ago saying that they were soliciting people in the
                    Who's Who to give some kind of statement that might indicate why they had been
                    successful, if one wanted to use that term. I didn't think much about it at that
                    time. I thought about why and how much help I had received from others. So I
                    really tried to put it down in a succinct fashion but never believed that I
                    would see anything from it, and was not aware that this had been accepted until
                    someone in the library at Rutgers University, where at that time I was working,
                    asked me had I seen the latest Who's Who. And I told him I never had any reason
                    to consult Who's Who on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>And when I opened the volume, there was this statement. And I felt that that was
                    a culmination of what my parents had contributed and my wife had contributed to
                    any success that I might have had. Sincerely I had this feeling. And the fact
                    that Who's Who accepted it from all of the people throughout America really had
                    some kind of a significance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Definitely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: I was at Rutgers; it's known that I'm going to be a math major; and the
                    mathematics people greeted me warmly. However, at that time there was this
                    system where the French Government would send the people of politics and
                    professors to various universities in America to give talks either on literature
                    or politics or whatever the case might be. They were always delivered in French.
                    I belonged to Alliance Fran�aise and my curiosity was piqued, and, also, I felt
                    from the beginning somewhat frustrated by not being able to follow completely
                    these talks. And for some reason or another I got in my head that I'd like to
                    learn how to speak a language like that fluently. And it reached a point where I
                    had to make a decision about a major by the time of my sophomore year and I
                    decided it would not be mathematics, but it would be French.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, there might have been an element of absurdity of a black lad in
                    1928 deciding that he would major in something called French. It is true that
                    this idea was challenged by a sociology professor at Rutgers University who
                    asked me point-blank, “Why are you doing something like this? What can a black
                    person ever do with a language like French? You should be taking something like
                    social sciences, something that would be of some help to you later on.” This
                    might have given me a little misgiving, but I had expected my parents would be
                    the ones to challenge this. They never did. Maybe it was the idea, well, if this
                    is what he wants to do, it's his choice. I don't know whether they thought, if
                    he's that stupid then let him learn the hard way. But, be that as it may, they
                    never challenged, not once, this concept of learning a foreign language.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I can tell you now, without any hesitation, if I had not made that choice in
                    1928, then what happened to me in 1959, in being selected as the first American
                    Ambassador to a French-speaking republic, Republic of Guinea, it would never
                    have taken place. There is a very direct connection.</p>
                <p>I'll just mention one other thing about my Rutgers career. I was successful in
                    getting a Phi Beta Kappa key at the end of my junior year. I did participate in
                    track and in wrestling, but there were two incidents that marred my career. The
                    first was something now which seems to be quite insignificant. In my sophomore
                    year I was participating with the wrestling team and the rule was, if you could
                    put everybody down in your class, you would be the person who would be selected
                    that particular week to wrestle in that particular weight class. At the time I
                    was wrestling in the 145-pound class. I was in good shape because of having
                    carried ice all summer, and also, after work, having trained down at the high
                    school field, the playground. Actually I was successful in putting down the
                    people against whom I was placed in this weight preceding the wrestling match
                    for Franklin and Marshall. I went up to see the names of the times the bus would
                    depart for Franklin and Marshall and my name was not on the list. And I felt it
                    was an oversight and hurried to see the wrestling captain. He couldn't give an
                    answer, the manager had no answer and then the coach. And, finally, I didn't
                    discover until after the team had gone on the bus that the idea was abroad that
                    the person at Franklin and Marshall would not want to wrestle a black
                    person.</p>
                <p>This was a humiliating something for a young person. It happened just prior to
                    Thanksgiving and when I went home to Hackensack, I said I was never going back
                    to college again. And my parents, instead of becoming excited, at first said
                    nothing and then later on my father finally said, “Son, we did not send you to
                    Rutgers to be a wrestler. Years from now if you had won a letter or a sweater,
                    the moths could eat that up, but if you have something in your head, nobody,
                    nobody can ever take that from you.”</p>
                <p>Well, after some thought I decided to go back to Rutgers. Now, in the senior year
                    it's time to practice teaching in French, but New Brunswick High School would
                    not accept me as a practice teacher. This created quite a problem, and I will
                    say that the man-who was trying to make placements in the education department
                    was very much embarrassed, and went around telling people: “Here we have a
                    second Paul Robeson. You should be happy to have him in your school.” That did
                    not help whatsoever.</p>
                <p>I first went down to Trenton because I'd heard that there was a school down
                    there. I'd never been in such a school before, and it turned out to be a
                    segregated school. I never knew what that was. We didn't have anything like that
                    in North Jersey. They said they're sorry they couldn't take any practice
                    teachers.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Then I came back and finally decided — I went to the language department head to
                    find out what to do. Someone had spoken to a man by the name of Mr. Messic over
                    at the vocational school in New Brunswick. He said he would be happy to have me
                    over as a practice teacher. However, I had to go over there as a practice
                    teacher in mathematics, not in French, and there were no blacks in the class yet
                    — nobody challenged my presence there. Well, these two things gave me a sort of
                    a soured feeling about dear old Rutgers, and at one point I said that I would
                    never go back there again, but I actually did return; I believe it was in
                    1948.</p>
                <p>Now out of Rutgers, where am I going to get a job? The depression's on, I'm back
                    in Hackensack trying to think now what's going to happen, and in July I received
                    a letter which made an offer of a job in some school in Trenton. I said, “Well,
                    this is a junior high school; this is not a high school or a college.” And they
                    talked about subjects like mathematics and geography. I knew about mathematics
                    and geography and they had nothing to do with language, and my parents said,
                    “Why don't you go and talk to the people?” I went down there to talk, and, of
                    course, as I had already indicated, I couldn't practice teach there. I
                    discovered that it was a segregated school in a capital, state capital of New
                    Jersey: New Lincoln School with a predominantly black population, as well as the
                    teachers. It is true if you looked at some of the teachers there might have been
                    some difficulty as far as identification was concerned, but they were all
                    black.</p>
                <p>I accepted the job there teaching mathematics and geography. I could have felt
                    that this was a disillusioning experience when I discovered that some of the
                    teachers there were not dedicated as the teachers I had had in Hackensack. And
                    we were all black. The students were black and I thought that this would be an
                    incentive to be sure that you could get these students interested in what they
                    were doing in terms of the future and going on to Trenton High School, for I
                    discovered that very few black students at that time even went on to Trenton
                    High School. But then I realized some people here don't care if these youngsters
                    go on or not. As a matter of fact, if they drop out it's okay.</p>
                <p>Well, to make a long story short, I think that my stay in Trenton was a
                    successful one. I became involved with the YMCA and we had a club, the James
                    Weldon Johnson Club. James Weldon Johnson sent us a letter of dedication. He was
                    the famous writer and poet at that time whose name was well known here as well
                    as abroad, and in later years I discovered that many of those youngsters who
                    were in the New Lincoln School, a number of whom I had taught, had gone on not
                    only to high school but beyond high school. That was a real payoff.</p>
                <p>I was in Trenton from 1931 to 1935 and went to a place called Bordentown, a
                    manual training school, which was in an adjacent town. Bordentown was a manual
                    training school but strangely enough it had an academic division. I was invited
                    there to teach Latin and English — at least getting closer to a foreign
                    language.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>It was at this point that I married a young woman by the name of Ann Rowena
                    Davis., who was a Hunter College graduate and at that time was working as a
                    social worker with the YWCA. It was this young woman who started getting after
                    me about graduate study. I told her I'd already done ten credits of graduate
                    study but they were in education, and I didn't like it. She said, “Why are you
                    doing something you don't like?” I said, “Well, I suppose it would be rather
                    stupid at this point to be spending more money on French, but that's what I
                    would really like to do.” Her answer was, “If that's what you want to do, you
                    should move in that direction immediately.”</p>
                <p>With that I enrolled in the graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania to
                    work for a master's degree, going down on Tuesdays, on Saturdays and, before it
                    was all over, one summer, at a financial sacrifice. My wife was always involved
                    in that sacrificial effort.</p>
                <p>Interesting thing about the University of Pennsylvania, I discovered then was
                    that they were not accustomed to having blacks in the language department, not
                    just taking French, just in the language department at all. And for some of the
                    professors it was a new experience. And I didn't pay any attention to this and
                    didn't become aware of it until the second year, when in the summer — it was the
                    second or third year — when in the summer I wanted to take three subjects. No,
                    it was the second year I wanted to take three subjects during the summer and
                    received a query from the dean which sort of implied, we are not sure that you
                    can do this.</p>
                <p>When I got this notice in New Brunswick, I got in my car and went down to
                    Philadelphia in a rage. I had to pay to go across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.
                    When I got there the dean was not in his office. I shall always feel that this
                    was the hand of Providence. I asked the secretary, “Miss Carey, can you explain
                    what this is to mean?” I said, “The only mark I have done here in Penn is the
                    basic course in old French which all students are required to take. I received
                    an “A” in that course. My Rutgers record, you have it; that's why I was entered
                    into the Graduate School. You see what it was: the Phi Beta Kappa. And I won't
                    talk about those things, but this is a matter on the record. What is the
                    problem?” “Oh,” she said. “I think what Dr. Green ... there's some kind of a
                    mistake here ... because it raised a question about whether you would have the
                    ability to do it.” I said, “Why don't you let me try? How can they
                    prejudge?”</p>
                <p>Well, getting back to the subject: Took three subjects that year; got “A's” in
                    all of them. Never any further question was every raised about “Could you do?”
                    “Why don't you?” “I don't think you should,” and so on.</p>
                <p>I got the master's degree in 1942; moved South in 1945 to become chairman of the
                    Foreign Language Department at Talladega College. Once again my wife's hand was
                    in this because she let me know that, if I ever wanted to teach on the college
                    level, since Rutgers didn't seem to be interested, Princeton was not interested,
                    definitely, nor Harvard, I'd better start looking around somewhere where maybe I
                    could actually make a contribution.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>The letter came all out of a clear sky from Talladega inquiring whether I would
                    be interested in a post there; and I threw it in the wastebasket, because I said
                    I would be damned if I would ever go South. My wife retrieved this letter before
                    we went up to Hackensack for the weekend, and she proceeded to lobby with my
                    mother and sister and brother on her obstinate, quote, “stupid husband's”
                    reaction about the South.</p>
                <p>The result of that lobby is that I ended up in Talladega in 1945, and from then
                    on it's a matter of history from 1945 to 1954; at Clark College in Atlanta from
                    1954 to 1956. I used to teach at Atlanta University in the summer, every summer
                    from '50 to '56 and then went to North Carolina College in Durham '56 to '59. It
                    was when I was in Durham that I got the call from the White House to go to
                    Guinea.</p>
                <p>In the process, however, it should be stated that I did take time out in 1947 to
                    take a year's leave to study toward a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. I
                    mention this because maybe again the hand of Providence; at that time I was
                    thirty-seven years old and that's considered in most places too old to be trying
                    to get a Ph.D. But who were the people who sponsored and signed and gave the
                    recommendations that people in the graduate school at the University of
                    Pennsylvania, who spoke about the record that this young man, young
                    thirty-seven, young man had achieved and thereby helped me get a General
                    Education Board fellowship which made it possible for a leave, with some
                    sacrifice once again on the part of my wife to be able to take off a year? Now
                    the fact that the General Education Board fellowship money came from the
                    Rockefeller money at that point did not bother me, because I felt that it must
                    be a worthy cause since it was for education, and, also, it was aiding a black
                    who had little or no money to hopefully attain an objective. Things went well;
                    the degree was received in 1952.</p>
                <p>Well, how did I ever get to Rutgers? I wasn't good enough when I had the Ph.D.;
                    the honor record didn't seem to matter; being a graduate influenced no one
                    whatsoever, but I got called by President Eisenhower to go way across the world
                    in another sphere, in another kind of work, had nothing to do with being a
                    departmental chairman of a foreign language department, and suddenly I am
                    discovered, or should I say, rediscovered by my alma mater.</p>
                <p>The first time they offered me the job — this is not known — they offered me a
                    job in 1961 and I had the satisfaction of turning it down because of the fact
                    that President Kennedy had asked me to go from the U.N. to UNESCO in Paris to
                    head the delegation there. And I felt, how could I give up a unique opportunity
                    like that to go to a place that just suddenly had discovered I was alive after
                    all these years? So, I went to France instead of going to Rutgers.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>In 1963, when we returned to this country for a tour of duty in Washington at the
                    Foreign Service Institute, Rutgers got on my trail and offered me an honorary
                    degree. And I came up to take that, although I was very happy to actually have
                    achieved with very hard work, with blood, sweat and blasphemy, the Ph.D. It was
                    after this trip to Rutgers that they eventually got in touch with me in '64 and
                    convinced me that I could probably do a job there instead of remaining at the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>On one footnote, when I turned in my resignation at the Department of State to
                    Dean Rusk, on January 13, 1964, indicating that I would like to resign as of
                    July 1, 1964, and ended up with the statement that “I shall leave Washington in
                    July with a deep sense of respect and admiration for the Foreign Service and the
                    Department of State. I shall be able to reiterate with sincerity the words
                    expressed by our late revered President, I served the United States Government
                    in that hour of our nation's need.”</p>
                <p>When I tendered this resignation to Dean Rusk, he would not accept it, and for
                    three months I was interviewed by various members of the Department of State
                    with the idea, why don't you stay with us? There are no political implications
                    now, you've served under three presidents, your record speaks for itself, we
                    need you here. And despite these people coming to see me constantly, I decided
                    to throw in my lot with Rutgers.</p>
                <p>Now my wife might have had a question about that because Penn State had made me
                    an offer, financially much better than the Rutgers offer, and they had sent down
                    one of the deans or directors of General Studies at Penn State, who spent two
                    days in Washington, among other things, trying to convince me to come to Penn
                    State. I didn't accept that offer. My wife might always have had some question
                    in her mind, but she remained quiet about it because I guess she decided that
                    this is just the reaction of the individual who maybe figured, ha, justice at
                    last!. He didn't like some of the things that happened when he was back at
                    Rutgers. Now here he gets a chance to go back there.</p>
                <p>I can't think of anything else that might be important at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd like to have you talk a good deal about that
                        time at Rutgers. But before you go into it, once you left that spot with
                        UNESCO in Paris, you also worked for a time at the School of Foreign
                        Affairs, the Foreign Service Institute at the Department of State. Could you
                        talk about that a little?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>MORROW: Yes, it's strange, I think. Maybe going back to the Foreign Service
                    Institute and being thrown into that particular post is really what made me
                    decide to go back to academia because of the fact that what it amounted to,
                    Foreign Service officers, at some point in their career, sometimes, if they are
                    qualified, can get a year off or maybe a little more to go away for graduate
                    study. There were Foreign Service officers at Princeton, Harvard, Yale, and
                    other institutions in the United States. I was confronted with helping them get
                    into these graduate schools and then going around to check on their progress.
                    Made trips to Princeton; made trips to Harvard and to Yale. And here I was
                    walking around on university campuses, checking up on people who were doing
                    graduate work, hearing their problems and it did something to me.</p>
                <p>Also, when I was asked to come back to Rutgers in 1963, to receive an honorary
                    degree, and went around that campus, went up to the stadium where they had the
                    graduation ceremonies, had to stand up and receive the hood and so on, and
                    looked out at that expanse, saw all of those students who were graduating —
                    something happened to one. And I suppose that even the people at Rutgers
                    figured, maybe now is the time to make an offer, because this guy might have
                    been softened by these various experiences. But it was really that going back to
                    the Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>Now I will give you this footnote. I had finally gotten to Rutgers in July and,
                    would you realize that a notice had come through from the State Department. They
                    wanted me to come down for consultation, because President Johnson wanted me to
                    go to Africa to explain the American political situation. Now I realize I
                    shouldn't use the expression, that this was sort of a come-on game, for they
                    figured if I would come back, then we could hook him and send him off somewhere
                    to another post. I didn't accept the offer because on that basis, how would it
                    look? Here I have just come to Rutgers and now I say, would you please give me
                    two or three months' leave so I can go on a mission for the Department of State?
                    I just can't do this in good conscience, so I turned down that offer. I have no
                    regrets.</p>
                <p>Once back at Rutgers something very interesting happened after I was there four
                    years. They had what was called the University Senate and was always presided
                    over by the president of the university; this time it was President Gross. I had
                    been elected one of the senators from the college that I was representing, and
                    the decision came to have a committee reorganize the Senate setup to try to make
                    it more effective. And one of the things that came out of the reorganization was
                    the fact that a faculty person should become the chairman of the Senate, and it
                    should no longer automatically be the president of the university who should
                    chair the Senate.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Now, the Senate was considered at Rutgers a rather august body, because, in most
                    instances, it was made up of full professors or associate professors mainly, one
                    or two. young assistant professors. The fact that you would be elected by your
                    peers to either be a member of the Senate was considered an honor. With
                    reorganization, where it took place in the fall of 1968 and went into effect in
                    1969, in an election of 1969, a nominating committee had to set up a slate, and
                    I was called on by several members of this committee and asked, “Would you be
                    willing to let us put your name up as the chairperson of the Senate?” I said, “I
                    don't think I'm interested in that sort of ... I like to participate in the
                    Senate with the concept that I don't like to be some kind of a straw.” And I was
                    told, “This is a serious offer.”</p>
                <p>Now the way slates were arranged at that time, there would be two people put up
                    for each office and there could be nominations from the floor. The second person
                    whose name had been put up to be chairman of the Senate was a chap who was very
                    much respected in the physics department, a young physics professor who had made
                    an excellent reputation for himself there at Rutgers. Something caused me to
                    say, “Go ahead, put up my mane.” And the elections were held and the group
                    committee that had to count the ballots went out and they came back in. They
                    announced that I had been elected as the first chairperson of the Senate.</p>
                <p>I must say that this was a great shock to me, because, despite the fact that
                    there's a lot of talk about integration and so on, there were people at Rutgers
                    who, by their attitude and actions prior to this point, had not shown themselves
                    particularly affable or overwhelmed by the fact that at long last Rutgers was
                    getting ready to allow blacks, if I can say “allow,” to participate in their
                    faculty. Because as I expressed to one person — getting off the subject of the
                    point — “You know, I've been able to walk from one end of this campus to the
                    other and I haven't even seen any black faces. What's going on here?” This is
                    what I remarked in 1963 when I came up for the honorary degree. I said I could
                    think that I saw a better average than this, why, even when I was an
                    undergraduate, because at least there was one black in each class. And I didn't
                    see any blacks in that graduating class of '63.</p>
                <p>But to get back to the subject of the Senate ... this was the beginning of a very
                    new era, most interesting, with problems and crises, one of the most interesting
                    periods in my career. I was re-elected chairman of the Senate even though this
                    was not in the constitution, because I had only served one-half of a term, that
                    is, one semester, so therefore for '69 and '70 I served.</p>
                <p>A sequel to that: In '72, I was elected by the Senate to be the faculty
                    representative to the. Board of Governors. This was considered, also, indeed an
                    honor, because only after 1971 did it become legal for a faculty member to serve
                    on the Board of Governors of the university because of the university laws. And
                    between '72 and '76, when we would sometimes be in these meetings slugging it
                    out, yes, slugging it out with the president and the vice president of academic
                    affairs on the behalf of the faculties of the whole university, it sounds
                    impossible and incredible. Yet it took place; it did happen. And when I look
                    back on it now, it does still seem incredible.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask you some questions about the kinds of
                        problems you dealt with when you were on the Senate and also when you served
                        as a faculty representative to the Board of Governors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: I don't want to sound like a person who is bitter. I guess you could call
                    me an old man now. With age is supposed to come wisdom and understanding and,
                    definitely, compassion. But I must admit Rutgers didn't owe me anything. I got
                    this degree and the honors. Many of my classmates were not quite as fortunate.
                    However, after getting out and going on to graduate work and attaining what has
                    been considered the necessary degrees, and publishing articles — not a book at
                    that time — I still somehow or another did not qualify to become, for example, a
                    member of the Rutgers faculty.</p>
                <p>Remember I said they did not owe me anything. They did not owe me a job. However,
                    when I finally did go back to Rutgers and took a look at the catalog, saw the
                    faculty people and met some of the faculty members, I discovered, for example,
                    one chap who was in the year before me. He graduated in 1930, and I graduated in
                    1931. He was a full professor teaching in the university. He didn't have a
                    Ph.D.; he had published practically nothing. No books. How in the hell did he
                    become a full professor? Did I think that was something?</p>
                <p>Why, there was a chap who was there, as I thought, a professor. He must have been
                    just an instructor when I was in my senior year, in the language department.
                    When I returned to Rutgers years later, he was an honored, respected professor.
                    He did not have a Ph.D.; he had never published (in a shout) anything!. Yet, he
                    had been part of the system. There was another chap ... well, why am I talking
                    like this? — whose father had been in the administration of the university, and
                    he now had become a member of a faction of the administration. Never had a Ph.D.
                    So I couldn't understand, well, what was the problem? If I had the so-called
                    union card and the qualifications, plus the record that could back them up, why
                    is it that Rutgers never considered that I was good enough to be a member of the
                    faculty? Now they came after me, yes, but that was after I had supposedly done
                    something in another sphere with the Department of State which had been
                    acknowledged publicly.</p>
                <p>Well, at least the door was opened, because I began to see a few more faces of
                    color in the Rutgers arena. And at least I had the satisfaction of knowing that
                    in the last part of the twentieth century, no matter what happened, there will
                    be some black people in various positions in the State University.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The question mark which is in my mind, however, is how do you install in young
                    people a feeling that will make them keep on keeping on despite what seem to be
                    the obstacles that cannot be overcome, despite the fact that the thing or
                    objective toward which they are striving sometimes seems impossible to attain?
                    How can we install this in the black youth of our country? It has to be done.
                    Now my parents were a help to me. Some youngsters don't have that kind of help.
                    Could we find some way, something that could be passed on so that always we will
                    know in the future that no matter what happens, our black youth will always try
                    to attain, try to reach objectives even if they're told, stop wasting your
                    time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Morrow, you've given us a very, very interesting
                        picture of your background from a youngster in Hackensack right up to
                        Rutgers and I think it helps. It will help future scholars better understand
                        your work as Ambassador. I'd like to back up to your period of service in
                        the diplomatic service and ask a couple of questions. If you had to go, if
                        you had the offer to go back to Guinea today, how would you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: In the first place, if I had an offer to go to Guinea or anywhere else,
                    the first demand I would make would be that of selecting my embassy staff. I
                    would not want somebody else to have the prerogative of deciding with whom I
                    would have to work in the particular post, especially if it is known that this
                    is going to be a difficult post. Now how do I go about choosing people? I can't
                    exactly say that at this point, and yet I would have an idea of the kind of
                    person with whom it would be possible to work successfully in a Guinean, let's
                    say, climate and situation. A chap, for example, like young David Korn, who was
                    in the Embassy in Paris in 1958 when I had to spend the summer in Paris because
                    of the fact that I wasn't able to go on to Algeria and to Africa. Korn happened
                    to be a chap with a Ph.D. from a respectable university. But he had a desire and
                    a real intent to become knowledgeable about Africa and Africans. It was not a
                    do-gooder concept, but a desire on the part of a person who realized, if I'm
                    going to be successful in this area or in any other area, I must know the
                    culture, the people, and find out everything that is possible about them and not
                    have preconceived attitudes and ideas as many Americans might have.</p>
                <p>Another thing. I would certainly try to discover, in some fashion, if the person
                    involved, or the people involved, were troubled with stereotypes. Do they have a
                    particular concept as to what a black should be doing? Can a black carry out a
                    position of leadership and responsibility? It would be things of that nature
                    that I would be interested in. As far as color was concerned, I don't care what
                    the person's color might be. It would be advisable to have a mixed staff, not to
                    have all either one color or the other color, if we're going to be
                    representative of America.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Secondly, I would need an assurance from, let's say, the Department of State that
                    the people in Washington were going to pay attention to the information which
                    was sent back to Washington, to pay attention to the requests, to the
                    suggestions; that they would become knowledgeable about the country by coming
                    out as did Senator Symington and Governor Harriman and Senators Church and
                    McGee, who took the trouble, back in the early days, to come out to the Guinean
                    scene to discover firsthand about the complexities and the problems. In their
                    instance, it was no longer necessary for them to conjecture about what a Guinean
                    was or what the situation was. They had met Guineans and they had seen.</p>
                <p>This is what I would ask in Washington. If they decided that this was asking too
                    much and we can get somebody who won't be so much trouble to us and be insisting
                    on this thing or that thing, then I would say to the offer, go to hell! I would
                    not accept. It's as simple as that. Ahm. (Mrs. Morrow speaking).</p>
                <p>Now, there is another side to this coin. I'd probably find it extremely difficult
                    to go to Africa at this point, because there're some places in Africa ...
                    because of being disillusioned by the folks who have been in positions of
                    leadership. They have talked to the world about independence, freedom,
                    democracy, the rights of the individual, the inherent right to life, liberty,
                    and pursuit of happiness. All these high-sounding terms, when it has come down
                    to the realities, seemingly, it has been a situation in which power has done
                    something to the individual who is in the place of leadership. I'm not going to
                    get specific in naming names, but all one has to do is to look over what has
                    happened in Africa for the last ten years, five years, three years, if you
                    please, two years, to see what kind of treatment the people have received from
                    the people in places of leadership.</p>
                <p>Take a look at the coups which have been effected in the various countries. Take
                    a look at the individuals who have been behind these attempts, successful in
                    many instances, to overthrow the government. Make an assessment to find out
                    whether the folks who had taken over power are treating their fellow countrymen
                    any better than the individual who has been put out of office, and you will
                    discover that, in most instances, the people don't seem to be any better
                    off.</p>
                <p>So it raises a question as far as diplomacy is concerned. How are you going to
                    deal with the realities which exist in many of the ... not just the African
                    countries, but Latin American countries, for example, at this point in history?
                    It's a real big question. It's a riddle, as a matter of fact. Now, I haven't
                    even taken up the question of terrorism, which is a new factor, which apparently
                    hangs over the head of all people, not just chiefs of mission, but anybody, a
                    secretary, or whatever the situation might be in the Embassy, or even in
                    industry. The new look, of course, is the question of terrorism. There's no
                    point in my trying to go into that now. Nobody has found an answer to that at
                    this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>One thing I must say would not be fear that would be a deterrent, because if I
                    had listened to the horror stories which I heard, for example, in 1959, when it
                    was known that I was going to Africa, and when I was being warned, do not under
                    any circumstances take my children and wife with me, if I had been motivated by
                    fear, I would never have put foot on the African continent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Morrow, you talked a good deal about some of the
                        unpleasant things, and I think it's pretty clear that the complot was one of
                        the things that was most unpleasant about your stay in Guinea. What were
                        your fondest memories? What are they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Fondest memories? For example, coming down out of the air in a plane,
                    circling for the first time a strange airfield; descending and being met with
                    music, with an army detachment standing at attention; having the privilege, for
                    the first time in one's life, to review a group of black soldiers standing very
                    erect, all correct, spit-and-polish, and realizing, here we are in Africa about
                    to go on a new venture; riding in a car, all along the way people shouting words
                    of welcome. I've already mentioned this, but when you say fond memories, it will
                    always stick with me. And you can hear some of the things that were being said
                    and you hoped that this greeting meant you should be successful in this effort
                    here in this tour of duty. Riding up to a political convention in somewhat
                    antiquated railroad cars along with members of the Guinea Government; riding
                    along as an invited guest to the political convention; participating in the
                    banter and exchanges on an equal level, and then of course, getting finally to
                    Kankan and hearing the President give a five-hour speech during which, of
                    course, one did not leave the arena (laughs) and (laughs some more)...</p>
                <p>On being invited to go up to a place called Fria. This was a consortium that
                    involved European companies and Olin Mathieson, an American company. The
                    American company owned about, I think, 45% of the venture. However, the members
                    of the Guinean Government decided to make an inspection tour of this Fria plant,
                    and when I got to the Pr�sidence that morning for the departure, we were
                    assigned to various cars. I looked around and didn't see any other members of
                    the diplomatic corps. I became very, very puzzled. How could this be a trip with
                    the President and all the Ministers going to Fria with just me along? Where are
                    all the other people? I decided that they would come later on in their own cars,
                    but this was a mistake. I had found out that I was the only outside guest.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights of this trip was not just visiting this huge consortium of
                    Fria where bauxite or mined bauxite was changed into aluminum — this was one of
                    the great resources of Guinea, besides the fact that there were some diamonds
                    and other assets.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>But getting back to this trip to Fria. As we moved around in the crowd, which, of
                    course, was there and everywhere to greet and applaud every little incident, a
                    little time later the President made it a point to relate in my presence what
                    was going on. He indicated that he had been asked by a number of the young women
                    in the area of Fria, who was this new young member of the Guinea Government? And
                    when he asked which one do you mean, they had pointed to the American
                    Ambassador. “And they decided,” said President Toure, “that you are one of us.
                    And they also decided that you were a Foulah.” Well, now I admit that the
                    Foulahs were very well educated people. But there was a little problem. A number
                    of the Foulahs had resisted getting rid of their chiefs and also had resisted
                    the ascension of President Toure. There would have been a time in Guinea when I
                    would not have wished to have been mistaken for a Foulah. However, at this point
                    it was a big joke.</p>
                <p>On the other side of this is the fact that there was a chap named Achkar Marof,
                    who was a Guinean representative to the United Nations. When he came back to
                    Guinea some time later and went into the interior with his name and appearance,
                    although he was somewhat shorter than I, he was mistaken for the American
                    Ambassador. So President Toure used to say that we were the exchange: that I was
                    the American who had become the Guinean and Marof was the Guinean who had become
                    the American (laughs).</p>
                <p>Among the memories would be, for example, some of the visits to the Pr�sidence
                    as, for example, on one occasion when we were downstairs waiting for President
                    Toure to come down and there were present the Soviet Ambassador,
                    Czechoslovakian, the United Arab Republic and from the Israeli Republic and
                    others, and I made the statement, in French, that we are always standing around
                    waiting like the people who open the doors: ushers, hoissiers. I'm sure this was
                    later reported to the President by someone in the Soviet delegation. But at that
                    point in time I was disgusted, impatient. Everybody agreed that that's exactly
                    what we were. We were waiting around like the people who waited at the door for
                    Toure and his group to make up their minds when they will get ready to go.</p>
                <p>Another instance would be, for example, when we were getting ready to take a trip
                    once again to the political convention in Kankan, and this time a bus was being
                    provided by the Guinean Government. The problem is that this was the bus that
                    had been constructed in Czechoslovakia, and it had no provisions for air
                    conditioning. So therefore it was an extremely uncomfortable, stuffy situation.
                    Here we are, the members of the diplomatic corps in this bus, waiting to go off,
                    and the Soviet Ambassador Solod had yet to arrive. I saw him getting into his
                    car, with a chauffeur, and called out to him and said, “Come on over here and
                    join the rest of the proletarians.” There was silence and then a roar, with the
                    Guineans and the other members of the diplomatic corps all laughing and the
                    Russian Ambassador shamefacedly walking over and getting in the car. It became
                    obvious that he had not intended to ride in that hot stuffy — I mean
                    Czechoslovakian bus — with the rest of the proletarians.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Some things at this point might escape me. For example, one occasion was the
                    opportunity of going to visit the Ivory Coast. That's the only time, the little
                    time off that my wife and I had during the whole period of time in Guinea, when
                    the Chiefs of Mission, for example, in Africa met in Tangier. This was sponsored
                    by the Department of State, so it was possible to get together to compare notes.
                    And I can recall, for example, after being called upon to make remarks,
                    everybody, of course, was interested in the Guinean situation. I came up with
                    the expression that hell hath no fury like a Frenchman scorned. Now some of the
                    Francophiles, I believe, from the Department of State did not particularly
                    appreciate that appraisal. But I had made it because of the fact that the French
                    apparently were getting back the report, back in Paris, that I was holding the
                    French at arm's length. That's very easily explained. When we first went into
                    Guinea, we were invited to a dinner by the French charg� d'affaires, Siraud. All
                    the people in the Embassy staff felt that I should accept the invitation. I
                    declined it. I wrote and explained to Siraud that I had not yet had a chance to
                    meet with the Guinean Minister. I know that the Guineans already felt that we
                    were taking instructions from him, the French.</p>
                <p>Little did I know that actually this was an accusation that was going to be
                    leveled by Ambassador Telli Diallo, who found out that we had stopped in Paris
                    on the way to Guinea. But that had only been a matter of transportation, and I
                    had not met any French, because a luncheon that was going to be planned by
                    Ambassador Amory Houghton, which would involve some people from Quai d'Orsay,
                    was cancelled under the feeling that I should have no meeting with any French
                    before arriving in Guinea. This turned out to be in vain since the Guineans
                    eventually decided, well, we were taking dictates from the French.</p>
                <p>But the reason why I used the expression of the Frenchman's scorn is merely
                    because of the fact that this was an erroneous report being sent back saying,
                    “France is being held at arm's length.” It paid off by having refused that
                    invitation, because later on we had other invitations that could be exchanged.
                    And at that point, the Guineans decided, well, I guess maybe the American is on
                    the level and he is following his own route in this country and not somebody
                    else's.</p>
                <p>What else could I say? During the trip to America, when we would go to various
                    cities and there would be receptions, there were these two other Guineans (even
                    though most Muslims do not) who would drink alcohol. There were at least these
                    two Ministers who would always be around near me when the cocktails were served;
                    and I discovered that they would be taking cocktails along with me. Of course,
                    President Toure finally named us the three musketeers (laughter), yet nobody
                    raised any religious questions. But it just seemed a bit of a coincidence that
                    every time I would have a drink, these two also seemed to have one (laughs) ...
                    And I got after them and said: “That's a long ways away from orange juice or
                    fruit juice.” And they would merely laugh but continued to take their
                    cocktails.</p>
                <p>It's a few memories, you know, like that, which makes one feel well disposed
                    toward a situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I remember, for example, the old man who carved from ivory the face that they
                    call “The Old Man's Face.” To see the workmanship of this individual was
                    something to behold. And incidentally, although one is not supposed to accept
                    any gifts, I got permission from the Department of State to accept the gift that
                    was given to me by President Toure, which was one of these ivory casts of what
                    was known as “The Old Man's Face.”</p>
                <p>Well, I think at this point, that just about covers it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at your diplomatic service in total, what did you
                        like most about the total experience? That's going beyond Guinea itself; the
                        total picture. What did you like most about this experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: The thing I liked most about the experience was the feeling of being
                    involved in something that was really vital and something that really counted,
                    and being one of the people who might be making a little dent towards having
                    better relations between my country, America, and other nations of the world.
                    This is the thing that gave motivation; this is the thing that was the
                    challenge; and this is what would keep one going on sometimes even though there
                    was a great deal of frustration and things did not always seem to turn out the
                    way one wanted. And if I had to do it all over again, I would like very much to
                    have had the experience of serving in such a capacity for the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Now one footnote: In the case of my son, and this I never said to him directly,
                    or said, well, I never said to him directly, “I hope you don't go into the
                    Department of State.” I made that statement to my wife about the fact that, with
                    his youth, with his intelligence and the fact that he would always be asking
                    questions and so on, he would probably end up in some post in Siberia. But
                    actually, I said to my son, “If you're thinking about going into the Department
                    of State, my suggestion to you is, do like your old man; start at the top
                    (laughs) and work your way down.”</p>
                <p>Yes, I think it's a wonderful thing to have had the opportunity to serve in the
                    capacities in which I did serve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now forgive me if I turn the coin and say, of that total
                        diplomatic service, of the full thing, what other things did you like least
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>MORROW: The things I liked least about it were the phoniness, hypocrisy, the
                    lying, and back-stabbing, the selfishness, the desire for self-advancement, even
                    if it's at the expense of one's so-called colleague; the lack of willingness to
                    answer questions in a straightforward and forthright manner for fear it might
                    somehow or another affect one's personal personnel report, and this might keep
                    somebody from going up in the ranks. I think it's a pity if you have a service
                    which gets to the point where people feel they cannot be honest; where people
                    might even feel they must sometimes withhold important necessary information or
                    withhold information that they ... the importance of which they are unaware, but
                    would be very important somewhere else, as if piecing together pieces of a
                    puzzle. It's too bad if a system will promote this kind of attitude, because
                    it's very detrimental. And particularly if people are in crises posts, you have
                    to have some kind of esprit de corps. You have to feel that you can trust the
                    person with whom you must deal, and that when you are told or given information,
                    they are trying to tell you as much as they actually know how.</p>
                <p>I think that the concept of the elite element in the Department of State should
                    be eliminated, if possible. The old school tie which makes it ... which means
                    that only unless one comes from a certain educational institution or from a
                    certain background should one become a Chief of Mission or a Charg� de Affaires,
                    or Ambassador, or, you name it. So on that side of the coin, these, I think, are
                    some of the things that at this point strike me as being most unfavorable in the
                    ambience of the Department of State experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:: If you were addressing a group of young people interested
                        in entering the Foreign Service, what advice would you give?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: First of all, I would say, be sure that you are applying yourself to your
                    studies in college right now. Whatever you are majoring in, try to do your very
                    best, put your very best foot forward.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I would say, and do not accuse me of having a vested interest, learn at
                    least one foreign language, preferably two, maybe even three. Even if at this
                    moment you cannot see any possible use that there might be for this, it will
                    become invaluable for your advancement, if you want to talk in those terms, in
                    the Foreign Service. In fact, it has become so valuable that at the Foreign
                    Service Institute, at this point, there are many languages which are being
                    taught, and this becomes part of the assessment on a person's personnel
                    record.</p>
                <p>In the third place, check yourself and see whether you are the kind of individual
                    who can feel comfortable around people and also around people who may not be of
                    the same country, nationality, or race. If you have any problems there, my
                    advice to you, do not go into the Foreign Service. Do you have any problems, for
                    example, about the concept of having to be far, far away from home without the
                    possibility of, say, getting back too frequently? Do you have any qualms in that
                    direction? You don't want to be in the Department of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>And, finally, because of what's happening throughout the world today, consider
                    seriously, will your temperament take being held as a hostage confronted with
                    the possibility of dying? Thirty-five years ago nobody talked about that when
                    they were thinking about the Department of State. Today, one has to be aware of
                    it, and if you can take this in as all part and parcel of the situation, then it
                    seems to me that you've got a good foot in on the way to the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>And, finally, how do you fare when you have to confront a group or panel who will
                    be asking you questions and trying to find out from you why you think you could
                    make a contribution to the Department of State?</p>
                <p>Be aware that if you pass all the examinations, you have to go before a panel
                    before you're finally taken in. Now, if you can take all thesthings in stride,
                    you're in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Morrow, thank you so very much for sharing with us
                        your recollections...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORROW: Well, I must say, Miss Tutt — that's a very interesting name — that it
                    has been a pleasure to me, a surprising pleasure to have been interviewed by a
                    very charming, young woman who not only is an exponent of grace, but also of
                    intelligence and poise. And you know, when you were asking about what I thought
                    in terms of the Department of State, I couldn't help but think how things would
                    have been different in Guinea, for example, or at the U.N., or in Paris, had it
                    been possible to have a person of the stature of Miss Tutt present on the staff.
                    Now this is not any blarney. As you know, I'm not Irish, and I'm trying to tell
                    you this as a result of our few hours of experience together. Now, if you say,
                    how could anybody possibly be making any such assessment, may I just call to
                    your attention that all my life has been spent in dealing with people. And when
                    I was asked how did you feel, what made you feel that you could be an
                    ambassador, my answer was that all my life I had been dealing with people and
                    have had to make judgments, sometimes at a very short notice, very important
                    judgments. So I think that I have a right, at my age and with my wisdom, to make
                    this assessment of the person who is interviewing me and saw to it that I even
                    went ahead and said some things I hadn't even been thinking about saying
                    (laughter). Amen!</p>
