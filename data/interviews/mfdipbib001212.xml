                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 23, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lets' start with your background. Where did you live in
                        your youth and where did you get your education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I grew up in Baltimore, Md. My family had been in the State of
                    Maryland for many years. I graduated from the Gilman School in Baltimore and
                    then, following my father's foot-steps, I went to Haverford College outside of
                    Philadelphia. My Haverford career was split. I was there for two years at the
                    beginning of the 40s, then I went into the Navy from 1943-46—I was an officer
                    for part of that time—and afterward I returned to Haverford graduating in 1947.
                    Then I returned to Baltimore and entered John Hopkins' graduate school. I
                    received a Ph.D. in Political Science in 1951.</p>
                <p>A few days after I had finished my graduate program at Hopkins, I joined the
                    Department of State, in June 1951, in the Executive Secretariat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you become interested in the Department of
                        State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: When I was in graduate school, I had three things that I was
                    interested in: one, teaching; the second, journalism and the third was the field
                    of foreign affairs. As I went through graduate school, my interest in foreign
                    affairs intensified and I decided to enter the Department of State. I was older
                    than most of the others who were trying to enter the Department, because of the
                    length of my academic studies. Therefore, I entered the Department rather than
                    the Foreign Service and converted to the latter in 1954, as part of the Wriston
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the Secretariat from 1951-54. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I was basically doing support work for the Secretary of State and for
                    the senior officers of the Department. It was one of the best jobs that any
                    person entering the Foreign Service could have had at that time because you got
                    an extraordinary overview of the Department, even through you were young and
                    very junior. You worked with some of the top people in the Department, not
                    closely in every case, but in a staff support position. For example, I worked on
                    a number of conferences or other activities involving Dean Acheson, who in my
                    judgement, has been the outstanding Secretary of State of my lifetime. Within a
                    few months of joining the Department, I was on foreign trips—to Germany, to
                    Korea, to the NATO Conference in Lisbon in February 1952 (that was the meeting
                    at which Turkey and Greece joined NATO). I was at an ideal vantage point from
                    which to learn how the foreign policy machinery of our government worked. This
                    was true both for the Department and other agencies because one was in close
                    touch with Department of Defense and with the NSC—we worked very closely with
                    the NSC staff. It was an ideal place to start a career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the relationships between the
                        Department of State, the NSC and Defense in the 1951-54 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: As a general statement, I would say that the relationship between
                    State, NSC and Defense was very good, certainly in the early period of my
                    involvement in the Department of State. One of the reasons for that was the
                    extraordinary relationship between President Harry Truman and Secretary Dean
                    Acheson. There probably could not have been two more dissimilar individuals in
                    terms of background or temperament, but they got along extremely well. One of
                    the reasons was that Dean Acheson recognized the primacy of the Presidency. When
                    Jimmy Byrnes was Secretary of State, he didn't recognize that. He had hoped to
                    become President himself. Acheson, on the other hand, was very careful during
                    international conferences to either report by telegram or telephone to the
                    President, so that there would be no surprises for Harry Truman on major issues.
                    It was a very creative period of American diplomacy. It was a period when NATO
                    was getting underway; it was the period of the Truman Doctrine; it was one of
                    the more exciting periods in American diplomacy. I feel very pleased and
                    privileged to have joined the Department at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the transition between the Truman
                        Administration and the Eisenhower one?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I was. There were some bumpy aspects to that period, particularly
                    when John Foster Dulles, as the new Secretary in early 1953, assembled the State
                    Department employees outside the building. It was a cold day. He made a
                    statement to the effect that loyalty up begets loyalty down or something like
                    that. The suggestion was that some of the Department's people might be less than
                    loyal to the new Administration. I must also underscore the fact that this was
                    the McCarthy era and there was tremendous suspicion of the Department of State
                    in some quarters—from Congress and from parts of the American public and press.
                    Acheson, as Secretary of State, had borne the brunt of some of these attacks
                    very effectively. When John Foster Dulles came in, there was a concern among a
                    number of people in the Department, including myself, that Dulles questioned the
                    loyalty of the people in the Department. Let me emphasize, however, that this
                    was a transient period. By the end of 1953, Dulles felt more secure in his
                    position as Secretary and the bureaucracy was more comfortable in dealing with
                    him. So after a rather rocky start, the relationship worked out reasonably
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in the Secretariat during the height of the
                        McCarthy period. How did you as a junior person feel about this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It did not affect me personally, but it did have an impact. Some of
                    the senior people I dealt with were particularly sensitive to being seen as
                    “soft” on Communism and related issues. This naturally affected people down the
                    line in State as a spin-off effect. That was part of the atmosphere at the time.
                    It tended to make it harder to debate issues within the Department than it might
                    have otherwise been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You suggest that there may have been a certain amount of
                        posturing to appear ideologically sound.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Yes, but that is not entirely unique. Top political leaders in
                    Government Departments in the United States, whether State or Defense or
                    elsewhere, are often adjusting to or reflecting domestic political pressures.
                    That was certainly true in the early 50s. It became less so with the reduction
                    of power of McCarthy, with the increasing self-confidence of the Administration,
                    and with the re-election of President Eisenhower in 1956. But it was certainly
                    part of the atmosphere from early 1953 into 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that when Dulles came in, despite his
                        prejudices, surrounded as he was by professionals, there was strong
                        leadership? Did they know where they wanted to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Yes and no. You did have the professionals who were carried on into
                    the Eisenhower-Dulles Administration. One felt comfortable with them because one
                    knew them. At the same time, John Foster Dulles had on his personal staff two
                    people—John Hanes, who later became a good friend—and Roderic O'Connor, who died
                    some years ago. These two came in with Dulles and worked in his outer office.
                    They threw their weight around rather effectively in the first year. Again, it
                    was part of a new Administration's effort to put its own imprint on both policy
                    and the modus operandi of the Department. Even though this does occur with every
                    new Administration, I felt it perhaps more because I had not experienced any
                    other transition period in my career. During subsequent transitions, I was
                    sometimes overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 1954-55, you were in Delhi and from 1955-58 you were
                        in Calcutta. How did you get into the Indian circuit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I became interested in India because of the belief in that period
                    that this country, in its early independence days, would become an increasingly
                    important power in Asia. India began under the strong leadership of Jawaharlal
                    Nehru as the Prime Minister. India played an important role in the non-aligned
                    movement which was important in those days with Nehru, Sukarno of Indonesia,
                    Nasser of Egypt and Tito of Yugoslavia as the major leaders. I was drawn to
                    India by what I anticipated would be the emerging importance of India
                    internationally. This did not turn out to be the case. I would say that India's
                    role internationally, and India's position in U.S. foreign policy priorities,
                    has not been as high as I had anticipated in the mid-50s. There were people
                    during that period—Chester Bowles, in particular, who was twice Ambassador to
                    India— who put a great deal of emphasis on India's international importance and
                    who saw India as a key competitor to the Peoples Republic of China. They
                    emphasized the need for the U.S. to take into account India's global importance,
                    not just its regional role. Chester Bowles exaggerated this importance and, in
                    the eyes of many, India has not achieved the international role that it aspired
                    to in the 1950s or others had expected of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a member of the entrance class of 1955, we looked
                        around the world, looking for places that would be exciting and at the same
                        time, would not become a backwater.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: This was undoubtedly a calculation too from a career point of view.
                    After I had finished the my tour in the Secretariat, the question then became
                    “What post should I seek which would be substantively interesting and would also
                    be a good post from the point of view of career progression”. I was as
                    interested in that as anybody. Looking back, I don't know whether people who
                    went to South Asia in the 1950s in the Foreign Service have, in relation to
                    other geographical areas, moved ahead all that fast. It is hard to judge.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The compass keeps swinging from one point to another
                        depending on the time. The Soviet specialists used to be that stars at one
                        time, but probably have not done as well recently. What type of work were
                        you doing in New Delhi and then Calcutta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I was basically a political officer. Let me say that originally, I
                    had wanted to go to Calcutta rather then New Delhi, but I was transferred to
                    Calcutta after only serving in Delhi for eight months. I was not very happy
                    about it at the time because, by then, I had become adjusted to the Embassy and
                    was enjoying myself. Then, all of a sudden, orders came from Washington saying
                    “You are transferred to Calcutta”. People who sent the orders undoubtedly
                    thought that I should be happy, but, initially, I was not because I had become
                    happy and satisfied with the Delhi assignment.</p>
                <p>It turned out that Calcutta was a very stimulating post. It was not in the
                    Capital of the country and, therefore, one had an opportunity to get in touch
                    with a number of people who were not part of the Indian bureaucracy or who were
                    not part of a very large diplomatic corps. It was a very exciting place
                    politically because you had to cover all of Eastern India and you also covered
                    the relationship between Eastern India and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The
                    political officer in Calcutta in those days was also dually accredited to Nepal
                    because it was the height of the cold war and the era of Sino-Soviet
                    cooperation, one was expected to cover a whole host of East-West political
                    issues which were being fought out in Calcutta. The politics there were very
                    volatile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a non-expert at this time, how did you report Indian
                        politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: One of the great joys of serving in India was the fact that it was in
                    fact a new democracy. You did have easy access to all elements in the Indian
                    society both in New Delhi and Calcutta. There was a general hesitancy at that
                    time about dealing with members of the Communist Party. We were not prohibited,
                    but it certainly was not encouraged. I remember that I did have an opportunity
                    to have a number of contacts with members of the Communist Party in West Bengal.
                    I felt pleased that I was able to talk to them about political developments. The
                    task there was to report on domestic political developments in four large East
                    India States: West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Orissa. In those days, much more
                    than now, there was a great deal of emphasis on keeping Washington informed on
                    the political developments in individual Indian states. With budgetary
                    constraints and personnel cutbacks, that is less so today. But at that time, as
                    a young officer in my thirties, I would travel outside of Calcutta to these
                    other jurisdictions, often with my wife, and talk to Chief Ministers, Cabinet
                    Ministers and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our major concerns in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: On the broad international level, and in terms of US-India bilateral
                    relationships, our main concern was that India, while professing to be
                    non-aligned, was in fact tilting toward the Soviet Union and China, in a period
                    during which those two countries had a close relationship. It was a period in
                    which Krishna Menon, the Indian Foreign Minister, epitomized non-alignment and
                    anti-Americanism, at least in the eyes of a lot of Western officials and the
                    American public. So in the international and bilateral fields, the concern was
                    that Indian policy not undermine American objectives which, to a substantial
                    degree, were designed to develop a containment policy vis-a-vis the Sino-Soviet
                    bloc. Domestically, we were concerned about India's drift to the left. India has
                    had for many years significant Communist Parties of various types. The Communist
                    Party in West Bengal was particularly potent as was the Communist Party in
                    Kerala in South India. Therefore, in terms of domestic reporting, it was focused
                    on the question of the extent to which Indian state governments were likely to
                    move to the left, often meaning that Communist elements were gaining power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might say that the over-all policy even in Calcutta
                        was part of the Cold War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: That is correct. It was in the mid- 1950s and the Cold War was the
                    dominant concern. We worried that the Communist strength, which could be seen in
                    the close relationship between the PRC and the Soviet Union, would expand into
                    South Asia. It was felt that India because of its “soft” non-aligned policy and
                    because of the strength of the indigenous Communist Parties was a prime target
                    for the expansion of Communist influence. It did not turn out that way, but that
                    was the concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and colleagues see these dangers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I would have to review my own reports. I don't remember them in that
                    much detail, but my feeling is that I was careful not to over-emphasize the “red
                    menace” because India had enormous strengths through the Congress Party which
                    was the vehicle for Indian independence. It had a very effective leadership
                    cadre, not just in New Delhi in Jawaharlal Nehru, but in a number of the State
                    governments. While there was concern about the growing strength of the left, in
                    retrospect that threat seems to have been overly stated. I hope that my
                    reporting was as balanced as it should have been under the circumstances.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Like so many other matters, it is hard to generalize. In India, you
                    had a very broad spectrum and you could talk to people on the right who were
                    very concerned about what they saw as excessive Communist and left- wing power
                    in India. You could talk to people on the left who were critical of corruption
                    in the Congress Party and who believed that the United States, in part because
                    of its support of Pakistan (an important element in the picture then), was
                    acting against Indian interests. There was a broad enough spectrum in India so
                    that one can't say that the then prevailing view was X, Y or Z. There were many
                    viewpoints and that is what made it so fascinating to serve there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to report much on East Pakistan—now
                        Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: We didn't report all that much on that from Calcutta. Sometimes we
                    would report on border clashes. I went up to Dacca several times. We sometimes
                    took turns taking the diplomatic pouch from Calcutta to Dacca. I can remember
                    going with the pouch and meeting the Consul General—who was a man by the name of
                    Bill Williams, who sometimes dressed as if the British had never left. He would
                    wear a white tunic, white shorts, white stockings to his knees and a pith
                    helmet. He would receive us very kindly and serve us gimlets, made with gin and
                    Rose's Lime Juice. We would spend the rest of the day in Dacca and then return
                    to Calcutta. Each officer in Calcutta did this about once every eight months. So
                    there was a contact between the Consulates General in Dacca and Calcutta. We did
                    some reporting on East Pakistan but most of the Indo-Pakistan reporting was done
                    by New Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the relationships between Delhi and Calcutta?
                        Were they reporting one India and you another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: We had a lot of autonomy in Calcutta. I was lucky enough to receive
                    several commendations from Washington for my reporting which gave me a certain
                    amount of self-confidence that I was doing at least what Washington wanted.
                    Copies of the commendations would go to the Embassy. So I did not feel, as some
                    constituent posts have felt, that we were kept on too close a leash by the
                    Embassy in the Capital. On the contrary, I felt that we had a lot of freedom and
                    autonomy in terms of picking political reporting priorities and in terms of our
                    ability to get out of the city to develop the information. Having said that, we
                    did operate under certain guidelines from Washington. At least once a year, you
                    would get guidelines from Washington on the kind of political reporting that the
                    Department was particularly interested in. This was helpful and kept one focused
                    on specific reporting targets. Beyond that I did not feel under constraints.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958, you moved to the other side of the border and the
                        dispute. You were assigned to Karachi until 1960 and then to what is now
                        known as Islamabad until 1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: That is correct. Between my tours in India and Pakistan, the
                    Department sent me, at my request, to the University of California in Berkeley.
                    I spent an academic year in the South Asia program at the University—which was a
                    very strong program. I learned a little Hindi and Urdu—Hindi being the
                    predominant language in North India and Urdu the language in what was West
                    Pakistan. The idea was that having served in India, and in the anticipation of
                    serving in Pakistan, it would be useful for me to have a year of area and
                    language study at California. The Department was very enlightened from that
                    point of view. It was an interesting year.</p>
                <p>After that I was assigned to Karachi which was then the Capital of Pakistan. I
                    was the number two political officer in the Embassy. The Ambassador when I
                    arrived was James Langley and he was followed by William Rountree. Langley, who
                    had been a newspaper editor, was a political appointee from New Hampshire—he was
                    a Sherman Adams man. He was taciturn. Rountree was a professional of the old
                    school. He was very good Ambassador. Langley had a DCM—Ridgway Knight— was also
                    a diplomat of the old school. He was a Western European specialist with a French
                    wife, spoke beautiful French and was probably wondering what he was doing in
                    Karachi. He once told me that he didn't think anybody should go into the Foreign
                    Service who didn't have a private income. He was a great connoisseur of wines.
                    Karachi was not a cultural or intellectual center in those days. Nevertheless,
                    Ridgway Knight was there as the number two to James Langley. Knight and Langley
                    worked together reasonably well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We in the Foreign Service have the tendency to identify
                        with the country in which we are serving. How did you adapt coming from
                        India who had been Pakistan's archrival for many years? Did you have a
                        different view of India from that of your colleagues in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It was valuable for me to have served in India. It was also valuable
                    for me to have gone to the South Asia program at California because I did get a
                    balanced view that you don't get if you only serve in one of the two countries.
                    South Asia is one case—duplicated in other areas—in which a bitter conflict
                    between two countries, India and Pakistan in this case, is the key foreign
                    policy and security issue in the region. There were other South Asian countries,
                    all smaller, but the India- Pakistan relationship was central and in those days.
                    In the late 50s and early 60s, Pakistan was seen as almost the equivalent of
                    India in terms of power and strength. The countries had fought at the time of
                    independence and the threat of war was present throughout my stay in South Asia.
                    There might have been some parochialism, but the career Foreign Service officers
                    who were doing political work were reasonably balanced in terms of reporting on
                    the issues between the two countries. I don't think the people in New Delhi were
                    over-influenced by Indian rhetoric and the same in Karachi for Pakistani
                    views.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: At that time, we were not deeply involved in South Asia. We were
                    fairly detached.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What then were our main interests in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Our interests were significant because, from the mid-50s, Pakistan
                    was seen as one of the key countries in terms of the containment policy against
                    the Soviet Union and the PRC. Pakistan was a member of the Baghdad Pact, which
                    also included the British, Iraq, Turkey and Iran. The Baghdad Pact was
                    established with strong American support. Pakistan was considered a key member
                    of the Pact. Pakistan was also a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty
                    organization (SEATO) which was set up for a somewhat similar purpose—the
                    containment of the USSR and the PRC. Therefore Pakistan was seen by some people
                    as the “linchpin” between those two security organizations. SEATO also included
                    Thailand and the Philippines. Pakistan was the only South Asian country which
                    belonged to both the Baghdad Pact (later CENTO) and to SEATO. It was therefore
                    seen as a key country in terms of stemming the advance of communism into South
                    and Southeast Asia. For that reason—particularly in the Eisenhower
                    administration—Pakistan rated quite high in terms of American foreign policy
                    interests in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>Beginning in about 1955, we began to supply Pakistan with a substantial amount of
                    military equipment. This in turn created continuing problems with India. While
                    the US said that it was providing military assistance to Pakistan to meet the
                    communist threat, the Indians—and privately a number of Pakistanis—believed that
                    the US-supplied arms were actually boosting Pakistan's threat to their country.
                    There is no question that there was a certain ambivalent viewpoint in the sense
                    that many Pakistanis did give lip service to the importance of the Baghdad Pact
                    and SEATO when seeking military assistance from the United States. At the same
                    time, they did recognize that these two organizations, by being the rationale
                    for military assistance, were enhancing Pakistan's strength vis-a-vis India
                    which continued to be Pakistan's unquestioned enemy—more so than the Soviet
                    Union or the PRC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your reporting, did you feel under any constrains about
                        reporting how the Pakistanis felt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I am sure that at the Ambassadorial level there was probably a
                    tendency to play down the fact that the Pakistanis saw the Indians as the key
                    threat. There was also the Congressional angle, as there usually is in such
                    cases. In order to get funds from the Congress for military supplies for
                    Pakistan, the Communist threat was an important element. Even though aid was
                    going to Pakistan for this purpose, some Pakistanis, at least privately,
                    admitted that it helped Pakistan vis-a-vis India. Nonetheless, we went through
                    the charade of highlighting the Soviet threat, even though people knew in their
                    hearts that the Pakistanis were receiving the US military aid to counter what
                    they saw as a larger threat from India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Pakistan at the time
                        you were there from 1958 to 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: When I first arrived in Pakistan, there was a coup d'etat in the
                    summer of 1958, when the government of Feroz Khan Noon was replaced by a
                    government later headed by Mohammed Ayub Khan. It was not a democratic
                    government in the true sense of the word. Ayub was a military man. He was one of
                    a number of military men who have headed Pakistan. But during the period I was
                    in Pakistan, there was relative stability in the aftermath of the coup that took
                    place in August, 1958. The US relationship with Ayub was quite a good one. I
                    remember that when Ayub came to the United States for a State visit in 1961 or
                    1962, the State dinner given by President Kennedy was one of the most splendid
                    ones given by any Administration. It was given at Mount Vernon. The guests came
                    down from Washington on a boat on the Potomac. The Kennedys really laid
                    themselves out. This was partially because of Jacqueline Kennedy's creativity in
                    terms of providing some variety for State dinners. But it also underscored the
                    importance the U.S. attached to its relationship with Pakistan by giving Ayub a
                    very special dinner. I cite that simply as a reflection, in protocol terms, of
                    the strong relationship that had developed. That relationship, however, began to
                    change in the 60s while Kennedy was still in the White House.</p>
                <p>It began to change as Pakistan was strengthening its ties to the PRC—a country
                    with which the U.S. then had a very antagonistic relationship. It changed
                    further with the war between China and India in October 1962 when the United
                    States, at the strong urging of the United States Ambassador in New Delhi, John
                    Kenneth Galbraith, provided military assistance to India in the aftermath of the
                    Chinese attack. This put a strain in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship and it was
                    really in the early 60s that there began a cooling of a relationship which was
                    at its closest for roughly a five- year period between 1955 and 1960. So from
                    1962 or, in the late Kennedy and early Johnson administrations, one found
                    something of a shift in the Pakistan-U.S. relationship.</p>

                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Partly because Pakistan, like India, had grown out of the British
                    colonial system, partly because many Pakistanis spoke English, you had easy
                    access— although somewhat more constrictive than in India. A political officer
                    could move around easily in Pakistan. This made the assignment very enjoyable. I
                    found it stimulating in career terms. I benefitted from developments in Pakistan
                    because at the time I was there, President Ayub Khan made the decision to move
                    the Capital from Karachi to the North and to establish a new Capital in
                    Islamabad. It was somewhat similar to an earlier decision by the British-Indian
                    government when it shifted the Capital from Calcutta to New Delhi or the
                    Australian government when it shifted the Capital from Sydney to Canberra. Ayub
                    felt that Karachi was not truly Pakistani; it was tainted by external influences
                    and corruption. In his view Islamabad, in Punjab Province, represented the real
                    heartland of Pakistan. So he made the decision to move the Capital to Islamabad.
                    In preparing to move the Capital, he started by shifting a large part of the
                    government, not to Islamabad which had not yet been build, but to the adjacent
                    city of Rawalpindi, which was an important city in the Punjab. So you had a
                    situation in which the Foreign Office stayed temporarily in Karachi while most
                    of the government moved 900 miles north to Rawalpindi in anticipation of the
                    building of a new Capital in Islamabad.</p>
                <p>The U.S. government was faced with an amusing and in some ways embarrassing
                    situation. We had just finished constructing a very large Embassy in Karachi—a
                    big, impressive building downtown—just as Ayub reached his decision. This
                    building must be one of the largest Consulate General buildings in the world
                    now. At the time the government shifted to Rawalpindi in anticipation of
                    building Islamabad, it told the foreign diplomatic missions that it did not have
                    enough accommodations in Rawalpindi even for its own bureaucrats, much less for
                    Embassy personnel. But the Pakistanis told the American Embassy that if it was
                    really interested, they would find accommodations for the US in a place called
                    Murree, which was in the sub-mountains of the Himalayas— located 40 miles north
                    of Rawalpindi, higher at a 7,500 foot altitude. It used to be a British hill
                    station before Pakistan became independent. The US accepted the Pakistani
                    offer.</p>
                <p>I was named by Ambassador Rountree to be “Officer-in- Charge” of what became to
                    be known as the “Murree Office of the American Embassy.” I was transferred with
                    my wife and my first child, who was born in Karachi, by military attach� plane.
                    We were flown to Rawalpindi and drove to Murree— about an hour and half drive up
                    into the mountains—and on George Washington's Birthday, 1960—I raised the flag
                    over the Murree Office of the American Embassy. The ceremony was attended by a
                    small, very cold group of people, including the divisional forest officer, the
                    local magistrate, and the general from the nearby cantonment. We had a small
                    office there for about four years. I was only there for 18 months. The purpose
                    of the Murree Office was to maintain some kind of representation between the
                    U.S. government and those elements of the Pakistani government which had moved
                    to Rawalpindi and to do general political-economic reporting.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Later, when Islamabad was completed, Murree was closed and the Embassy shifted
                    from Karachi. I was in Murree in the interim period which from a career point of
                    view was a real plus because I was named the head of a small staff—five people.
                    I wrote up my experiences for the Foreign Service Journal in the early 60s in an
                    article entitled “Mission to Murree”. It was a very unique post and I sometimes
                    tended to forget that I was not the American Ambassador to Pakistan, as William
                    Rountree gently reminded me at times. For example, I sent several telegrams
                    directly to Washington. We had to do this on a “one time pad”—a very primitive
                    coding device. He made it clear to me—in diplomatic terms—that I should report
                    through Karachi. Murree was a very unusual post in the sense that to get to the
                    government of Pakistan in Rawalpindi I had to travel an hour and half down the
                    mountain and an hour and a half back—three hours for a round trip. When I was
                    down in Rawalpindi, if I wanted to spend the night, I would have to use the AID
                    guesthouse. If I went down for a social function with my wife, the choice was
                    either drive back late at night on a very winding, difficult road or spend the
                    night in the guest house. Murree gave me the opportunity, as a relatively young
                    officer, to run my own post. I think I was seen by Washington to have done a
                    reasonably good job and that helped me in career terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then returned to the Department to deal with NATO
                        Affairs from 1961 to 1964. What were your main interests in this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: During this period, I was in charge of a small unit within the Bureau
                    of European Affairs. In that Bureau there is an office called Office of Regional
                    Political-Military Affairs (RPM). Within that, I was in charge of preparing
                    guidance for the US Permanent Representative to NATO, who was then in
                    Paris—Thomas Finletter— concerning political issues on which we could share
                    information with our allies. There was a great deal of emphasis on what was
                    called political consultation. That meant, to the degree that we could, we would
                    share with the other thirteen NATO countries assessments of political issues in
                    different parts of the world, or provide advance word on what we were planning
                    to do as a government. My task was to keep in touch with all relevant parts of
                    the Department and prepare regular telegrams to Paris on key political
                    issues—for example, the US view on the situation in the Middle East—to try to
                    give our NATO partners a feeling that they were part of the American political
                    assessment process. We were prepared to consult in advance on a number of issues
                    if they were non-sensitive or uncontentious. If we were concerned that our NATO
                    partners might object, however, we would not always consult. So political
                    consultation was great in theory, but in practice we judged the degree to which
                    we consulted by the effect such consultation might have on our own
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would draft a telegram summarizing our position. Would
                        some one censor it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: They might. We really had to rely on other parts of the Bureau of
                    European Affairs or on other parts of the Department of State. We did not in my
                    unit have the substantive expertise to put together a telegram on specific
                    issues. We would have to go other Bureaus and ask them to draft a message on the
                    specific issue. They usually gave us something which they had already prepared
                    for some other purpose, rather than writing something specially for us. As you
                    know in the Department, one Bureau doesn't want to spend its time writing
                    material for another Bureau. We had to live “off the land” and encourage other
                    parts of the Department to permit us to send political assessments to Paris.
                    That also meant that they would have to clear any messages that we might have
                    sent. My task was really to negotiate the text of the messages to Paris. I had
                    working with me John Gunther Dean—later Ambassador to India. There were only two
                    of us in that unit, but RPM as a whole was a very strong office: George Vest was
                    in and out, Walter Stoessel—later Ambassador to Moscow—was the Political Advisor
                    to the Allied Commander in Europe (POLAD), Dave Popper and Ron Spiers headed
                    RPM. It was a very interesting period and quite different from South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the War College from 1964 to 1965 and then you
                        were assigned to Ankara, Turkey as Political Counselor from 1965 to 1968.
                        What were the main issues that you addressed in Turkey during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: The key international problem for Turkey then and now was its
                    relationship with Greece; the contentious issue then and now was Cyprus. The
                    task for American diplomacy was to maintain reasonably satisfactory relations
                    with both Turkey and Greece since both were members of NATO and we believed that
                    it was very important to keep a degree of cohesion in the southeastern flank of
                    NATO at a time when these countries were on the verge of war. It was almost a
                    replay if the India-Pakistan situation. It was obviously different, but there
                    were similar elements.</p>
                <p>There was a crisis over Cyprus in 1967. Cyrus Vance, later Secretary of State,
                    was involved in it. The main task for American diplomacy was to assure the Turks
                    of continued U.S. support while at the same time we were seeking to maintain
                    satisfactory relationships with Greece. The domestic political equation on the
                    Greek-Turkey question is that there are many more Greek-Americans than there are
                    Turkish- Americans. That created domestic pressures favoring the Greeks. At the
                    same time, Turkey was considered as very important in the NATO context because
                    of its border with the Soviet Union. This was at a time of the Cold War so that
                    there was strong emphasis on supporting Turkey as a NATO partner which was
                    protecting the Eastern flank of NATO and which was threatened by the Soviet
                    Union. This factor was constantly mentioned when the question of military aid
                    arose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As Political Counselor, you talked to the Turkish Foreign
                        Ministry and others. Were the Turks more concerned about the USSR than the
                        Greeks, whose exclusive focus was Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: The Turks were very much concerned about the Greek role in Cyprus.
                    They were concerned about the impact of mainland Greek activities on the island
                    vis-a- vis the Turkish minority, which comprised about 20 percent of the Cyprus
                    population. They were very, very sensitive to any efforts by Greece to put into
                    effect ENOSIS which was the union of Greece and Cyprus. While the Turks had the
                    military power and the population advantage to prevail in a military
                    confrontation with Greece, they were less certain on Cyprus, partly because of
                    the geography of Cyprus, partly because of the concern about the international
                    impact of a Turkish invasion of Cyprus. When Turkey did invade the Island, this
                    caused a suspension of U.S. aid—this occurred after my tour. Incidentally, for
                    those who are interested in this period, Parker Hart, the former Ambassador, has
                    just written a book on his experiences in Turkey, including the Cyprus crisis of
                    1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Turks to deal with? Were they greatly
                        different from the South Asians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: A lot of people felt that they had difficulty dealing with the
                    Indians because of the perceived “Indian arrogance” and India's alleged disdain
                    for America. That was very much overstated. I did not have any difficulty in
                    dealing with the Indians or the Pakistanis, either. The Turks were quite easy to
                    deal with. By and large U.S.-Turkey relationships were fairly good and that may
                    have helped matters. The aid levels were holding up reasonably well. Turkey had
                    a pretty good reputation in the United States. Some of that went back to Turkish
                    support for the U.S. effort in Korea when the Turks sent troops. They also had a
                    very good top-level Foreign Ministry careerist by the name of Ilter Turkmen, who
                    later became Ambassador to France and the UN. I had a very good relationship
                    with him. Over all, the relationship was good. On the other hand, at the
                    Ambassadorial level, Ambassador Hart took a lot of knocks from the Turkish press
                    on the Cyprus question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Turks view the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It is hard to judge motivation, but the answer is that they felt
                    threatened because of Soviet pressures after World War II in Eastern Turkey and
                    in the Bosporus waterways. At the same time, there probably were elements in the
                    picture similar to those prevailing in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. While the
                    Turks were concerned about the Soviet threat, they were also interested in U.S.
                    military assistance in the context of maintaining their military superiority
                    over Greece. In relative terms, the Turks saw a more direct threat from the USSR
                    than did Pakistan, which at the time had the advantage of having Afghanistan as
                    a separation between it and the Soviet Union. There was a bit of ambivalence on
                    the Turkish side as well in the sense that they recognized that emphasis on the
                    Soviet threat enhanced their prospects for U.S. military assistance for
                    themselves.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 1968 to 1969, you were Country Director for India,
                        Ceylon and Nepal and then you became a Deputy Assistant Secretary for the
                        Near East and South Asia Bureau for three years starting in 1969. What were
                        the main issues that concerned you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: From 1968 to 1972 was the most interesting period of my Foreign
                    Service career. It was also the most difficult because I was directly involved
                    in Indo-Pakistan conflict over East Pakistan, later Bangladesh. In March 1971,
                    this came to a head with the crack-down by Pakistani forces on what they
                    considered as dissident elements in East Pakistan. I have written this up in
                    some detail in an article in Asian Survey which came out in 1980 called “The
                    Tilt Policy Revisited”. For me the basic problem at the time was that under Joe
                    Sisco, then the NEA Assistant Secretary, I was essentially in charge of South
                    Asian policy- -Afghanistan through East Pakistan and Nepal and Sri Lanka. The
                    Nixon Administration, with Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor—was
                    leaning strongly in the direction of Pakistan. Therefore, when the Pakistanis
                    cracked down in East Pakistan in March, 1971, the Administration sought to
                    cushion the impact in terms of Congressional and American public reaction. There
                    was considerable public revulsion. The sentiment on the Hill, the public at
                    large and the academic community was very much in opposition to Pakistani action
                    of March 1971 and subsequent actions that led to the two-week war in December
                    1971 between India and Pakistan. The Indian forces prevailed and Pakistan's
                    defeat led to the creation of a new country—Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>The Nixon Administration was predisposed to Pakistan for a variety of reasons.
                    For one, Pakistan had a role in the security arrangements, as I discussed
                    earlier—Baghdad Pact (later CENTO) and SEATO. Second, it had a rather negative
                    attitude toward India, driven by Nixon's personal view which was a factor.
                    Third, and most important from an operational point of view, Pakistan, headed by
                    General Yahya Khan, was the key intermediary between the U.S. and China during
                    the secret negotiations for an opening of U.S.-Sino relations which was
                    developed by Nixon and implemented in the 1971 period by Henry Kissinger. This
                    last factor was unknown to people at a relatively high level such as myself.
                    Included in these secret dialogues was Kissinger's secret trip to China in the
                    summer of 1971.</p>
                <p>It should be remembered that, at this time, China was seen as one of the most
                    irreconcilable enemies of the United States. The U.S.-China relationship was
                    bitterly conflictive, so that the Kissinger mission to China, which was
                    announced publicly in August 1971, was a very dramatic event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It should also be noted that at the time, we were still
                        heavily involved in the Vietnam war in which the Chinese were supporting our
                        opponents.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>VAN HOLLEN: The Vietnamese war was still part of the picture. The whole China
                    initiative was considered as a key foreign policy initiative of the Nixon
                    Administration. There were a number of reasons for that initiative including the
                    use of China as an offset to the Soviet Union. Because Pakistan was seen as a
                    key intermediary in this process, Nixon and Kissinger were very reluctant to
                    take any action against Pakistan which might upset the evolution of the U.S.-
                    Chinese relationship through the good offices of Pakistan, which had at that
                    time a good relationship with China. My problem, as Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    handling South Asian issues, was that I felt that we should be pursuing a more
                    even-handed policy toward India and Pakistan, rather than tilting toward the
                    latter. Of course, I had no knowledge of the negotiations with the Chinese. I
                    was not alone. The Secretary of State, William Rogers, was not aware of the
                    Kissinger mission to China until Kissinger was about to get on the plane in
                    Islamabad to fly to China in the summer of 1971. The entire State Department was
                    cut out of the picture. The opening to China was run almost exclusively out of
                    the White House.</p>
                <p>So 1971 was a particularly difficult period for me. I was also chosen to defend
                    U.S. policy on the Hill, which was not an easy task because the sentiment was
                    overwhelmingly opposed to the Pakistani actions in East Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your feelings about the conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It was a very difficult situation in terms of the reporting from New
                    Delhi and Islamabad because we had in India at the time as Ambassador, Kenneth
                    Keating, former Senator from New York and a man who had been active in
                    Republican politics. In Pakistan, our Ambassador was Joseph Farland, a political
                    appointee, whose wife had made money in the coal industry in West Virginia. We
                    got into a situation in which Keating's reporting from Delhi was seen by many
                    people in Washington as being very supportive of the Indian position while
                    Farland was endorsing the Pakistan position. They were at loggerheads many times
                    openly in their reporting. No one could have been objective in a situation like
                    that. There had to be a certain amount of subjectivity. Emotions ran very high.
                    Policy and personality differences ran very high between Keating and Farland.
                    This complicated the Washington task of accurately assessing the political
                    situation in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this personal tension force you to by-pass these two
                        political appointees by calling the Political Counselors in the two
                        Embassies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: We didn't do much of that because this was an era before the frequent
                    use of telephones became the vogue. I have now been out of the Department for
                    ten years and I am therefore not up to date on current developments, but I have
                    the impression that telephones are used much, much more now. We used the phone
                    when I was in the NATO job to call Paris, but in the South Asia affairs, perhaps
                    because of the distance or the time differential, we did not use it very often.
                    This doesn't mean that we didn't get a lot of information independently from the
                    Ambassadors. We would get “Official-Informal” letters in which the author could
                    speak with great deal of candor. Those were separate from the telegraphic
                    traffic. We would also have staff members of the two embassies come back to
                    Washington. People went to Delhi and Islamabad for visits. So there was an
                    extraordinary amount of information available through informal channels. In
                    addition to the Embassy and intelligence cable reporting, which came in great
                    quantities, we had people who gave us the “real picture” on a private basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the Consul General in Dacca report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: This was one of the more dramatic aspects of 1971. At the time of the
                    Pakistan crack-down, there was a tendency in Washington, because of the
                    sensitivity of the opening to China, to try to play down the brutality and
                    repression in East Pakistan. We did decide after the Pakistani troops moved in,
                    to withdraw most of our personnel from Dacca. The language used by the
                    Department was that we were “thinning out” our staff. But this official language
                    used to explain our reaction to the Pakistani crackdown was very upsetting to
                    the people in Dacca who were on the ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>A special communications channel had been developed earlier, called the “Dissent
                    Channel” which was to be used as a private channel to the Secretary from State
                    Department people who disagreed with any policy then in effect. The Consul
                    General in Dacca, Archer Blood, sent in a message through the “Dissent Channel”
                    which took sharp issue with the Department's characterization of events and the
                    use of the term “thin out” instead of “evacuation”. Blood argued that Americans,
                    in good conscience, should be more open in their criticism of the Pakistani
                    military actions. We also had some dissent within the Bureau of Near Eastern and
                    South Asian Affairs. Very able, younger officers went to see Joe Sisco, then
                    Assistant Secretary of State, reinforcing the view of the Dacca staff. Then,
                    inevitably, there were leaks to the press. The “Dissent Channel” cable sent by
                    Blood and signed by about everybody in the Dacca Consulate General turned up in
                    the Washington Post. These leaks and the great disquiet among some of the
                    younger Foreign Service officers involved in South Asian affairs also got in the
                    press. It helped to fuel the strong opposition to U.S. policy that was already
                    present in the Congress and among the public. It is often forgotten that this
                    issue generated considerable public debate. There were one or two rallies in
                    Madison Square Garden on behalf of the Bengalis. The strong public sentiment
                    favored stronger U.S. actions against Pakistan. But of course what was going on
                    behind the scene, relating to the opening to China, from March, 1971 to August,
                    1971, was an entirely separate activity. I was completely unaware of this, as
                    was Joe Sisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and Sisco discuss informally the NSC views and
                        guidance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Not much. Joe Sisco adjusted more easily than I did to the prevailing
                    policy guidelines. He was basically very interested in the Arab-Israeli problem
                    and much less so in South Asia, although he recognized that it was one of his
                    key responsibilities. He was therefore for various reasons quite willing to let
                    me testify in Congress. I was served up as the sacrificial lamb. I was very
                    concerned. At one time, I was on the verge of resigning because of the strong
                    differences I had with the policy. I remember writing out in long hand a
                    resignation letter. Then I thought that this might be just a one-day story in
                    the press. Everybody would say that I resigned for good cause but it wouldn't
                    have much effect on U.S. policy. I decided I could be more effective staying in
                    the system and expressing my views as an active member of the Department. So I
                    didn't go through with it, but I did consider resignation. It was a very
                    difficult personal period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble with your junior officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Yes. Some of them, who were very able and knew South Asia—most had
                    served in the area—were very upset. So we did have pressures from below, but I
                    never told them about my own feelings or that I had considered resignation. I
                    shared my concerns with my wife. 1971 was my most difficult period in the
                    Foreign Service. In retrospect, on the other hand, it was one of the most
                    interesting and important periods for me. When I left the Foreign Service in
                    1979, I went to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace for almost three
                    years. I was out of the government, but my recollections were still fresh. Henry
                    Kissinger's book “The White House Years” had just been published. It included a
                    long chapter on South Asia and the India-Pakistan relations. I read that chapter
                    and decided that he had not described the the events as I remembered them. So I
                    wrote a rather long article on the tilt policy for Asian Survey. The article,
                    depending of course on one's predilections, was pretty well received. Within the
                    past six month, my wife met a professor at Penn, who told her that she had
                    assigned the Kissinger chapter and my article to her students. That, I believe,
                    is still being done in a number of colleges and universities where South Asia is
                    being studied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you discuss the difference of working for Parker Hart
                        and Joe Sisco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: They were very, very different. Sisco replaced Hart as Assistant
                    Secretary, after only a few months of Hart's tenure in that job. When the new
                    Nixon Administration came in, Secretary William Rogers, who had known Joe Sisco
                    through his UN work replaced Hart. Parker Hart was essentially a Middle East
                    specialist, who had been our Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. He was a
                    real career Foreign Service officer. Joe Sisco rose through a different route.
                    He was essentially a Departmental officer; he had never served overseas. But he
                    was an extremely adroit bureaucratic operator and I say that in a positive sense
                    of the phrase. He had mastered the intricacies of the UN system when few others
                    knew anything about it or was interested in it. He was a very important figure
                    in terms of UN political affairs. It was through his UN background and his
                    involvement in the UN on the Arab-Israeli issue that led to his appointment by
                    Rogers. Sisco had very good political antennae. He did not usually deal directly
                    with Henry Kissinger directly when Kissinger was the NSC Adviser, but he did
                    deal with Al Haig, who was the NSC Deputy Adviser during this period. Sisco was
                    also very adroit with the press and with the Hill. Some people have argued that
                    he was a manipulator and that he had his eye on the main chance. He was quite a
                    different person than Parker Hart. Hart would not have been able to deal as
                    directly with the press and the Hill as Sisco did. Sisco later became Under
                    Secretary of State for Political Affairs—the number three position in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Secretary Rogers' role during the Indo- Pakistan
                        war and the aftermath?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: He did not play a very direct role. The senior person who was most
                    interested in the issue was Jack Irwin, the Under Secretary, the number two man
                    in the Department. He was a very thoughtful person and very sensitive. Irwin
                    seemed to be sympathetic to the views of people like myself who felt that we
                    should have had a more even- handed policy. But he didn't have that much
                    influence in the bureaucracy as a whole and, because of the unquestionably
                    unsatisfactory relationship between Henry Kissinger and William Rogers, the
                    latter was cut out of much of South Asian policy. The opening to China was
                    essentially a White House creation and Rogers, as far as I know, was unaware of
                    the negotiations until they had been well under way for many months. On South
                    Asian issues at least, Rogers did not play an important or central role. Irwin
                    was interested in it, but as number two to a Secretary who did not have
                    bureaucratic strength vis-a-vis the White House, he was not able to convert his
                    views into policy changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Bureau view the creation of Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: I may have been the author of the phrase “international basket case.”
                    I went to a meeting at the White House, which Kissinger was chairing, with Alex
                    Johnson who was there representing State. I made some smart side remark to
                    Johnson about Bangladesh becoming an “international basket case” and he repeated
                    it during the meeting. It got out into the press and, unfortunately, this has
                    been hung around Bangladesh's neck ever since. I am not proud of authorship of
                    the phrase. Anyone looking at South Asia in the context of developments in the
                    50s and 60s would have recognized that over time, Pakistan was not viable
                    divided into two parts because of the extraordinary dissimilarities between East
                    and West Pakistan. The only thing that held them together was their mutual
                    antagonism to India and the fact that they both had Moslem majorities. Islam
                    itself, however, was not enough to hold Pakistan together because the Bengalis
                    were so different ethnically, culturally and linguistically from the people in
                    West Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I don't have any strong feeling about Bangladesh in terms of its international
                    standing. It is a case of a country which, despite its enormous population,
                    weighs very little in the international equation. My only feeling was that the
                    political developments in South Asia made inevitable the separation of East from
                    West Pakistan. We should have recognized that fact and not pretended that
                    General Yahya Khan or anybody else could have patched things up and held the
                    country together. It was just a basic judgement that independence was
                    inevitable. It was not judgement shared by everybody. It was my view that we
                    should not have taken actions which would have seemed to support efforts by West
                    Pakistan to hold East Pakistan in the same country. It was really more a
                    judgement about the fact that independence would come rather than on any special
                    feeling about Bangladesh.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like now to turn to you final overseas assignment
                        as Ambassador to Sri Lanka—formerly Ceylon. You were there from 1972 to
                        1976. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It came about because I had been in a Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    position which often, but not always, is a stepping stone to an Ambassadorial
                    appointment. I had expressed an interest in Sri Lanka and Joe Sisco supported
                    me, even though our relationship was not always that close. I was endorsed by
                    the White House even though I was not fully persona-grata there—partly because
                    of the Bangladesh affair. But the judgement was probably made that I was a
                    career Foreign Service officer who presumably knew South Asia and Sri Lanka
                    would have been an appropriate assignment for me. I was also given an
                    endorsement by John Connally of Texas—under strange circumstances. Connally had
                    taken a trip around the world in early 1972 and I was assigned to be the South
                    Asia man for Connally on one leg of the trip. I seemed to have gotten along
                    reasonably well with him. Connally had been Secretary of the Treasury . He had
                    switched from Democrat to Republican and the rumor on the plane at the time was
                    that Richard Nixon was going to drop Spiro Agnew as Vice-President and put
                    Connally on the ticket as his Vice-Presidential candidate for the 1972 election.
                    It didn't work that way. In any event, I was with Connally for two or three
                    weeks, including the first visit of any high level American official to
                    Bangladesh after its independence. Connally stopped in Dacca in early 1972. My
                    appointment seems to have come about because of my rather good record in the
                    Foreign Service, a helpful word from Connally and the fact that I hadn't made
                    too many enemies in the White House.</p>
                <p>Before I arrived in Sri Lanka, it had had an election in 1971 which brought into
                    power a left-center Socialist government which had a fairly strong streak of
                    anti- Americanism. The Bandaranaike government, headed by Mrs. Bandaranaike,
                    kicked out the Peace Corps. The government was viewed by us as an unfriendly
                    one. It consisted of three elements: one, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party—known as
                    the SLFP—which was Mrs. Bandaranaike's party; then there were three Cabinet
                    Ministers who were Trotskyites and there was one Minister from the Communist
                    Party. It was definitely a left-center government which was anti-American in its
                    orientation. That was the situation that greeted me upon my arrival, except that
                    before I arrived, there had been an insurrection on the island by some young
                    left wing Sinhalese youths. The government had applied to the U.S. for support.
                    I was still Deputy Assistant Secretary for the area when this occurred. We had
                    responded positively by providing some non-lethal equipment—such as
                    helicopters—to assist in suppressing the rebellion. The fact that U.S. responded
                    to the Sri Lanka request in time of need was one of the factors which made the
                    government begin to turn around a bit. So when I arrived, the relationship,
                    although not close, was better than it had been the year before. I benefited
                    from that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Sri Lanka during the
                        period 1972-76?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: There were not transcendent interests, but there were some interests.
                    This was a period during which we were in deep competition with the Soviets and
                    the Chinese and both of those countries had active interests in Sri Lanka. So
                    our concern was that there not be an excessive increase in Soviet or Chinese
                    penetration, even though those two countries were no longer close—the break
                    between them having taken place. Second, from a strategic point of view,
                    although we did not covet the large naval base at Trincomalee, we wanted to be
                    sure that no other country—i.e., the Chinese and Soviets—would be involved.
                    Third, we were also building up Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and we were
                    interested in having American ship visits into Colombo. It was a combination of
                    not wanting the two other major powers to enhance their interests in the island
                    and to have access ourselves for naval visits and trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have many commercial interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Very limited. Sri Lanka had three main exports: tea, rubber and
                    coconut. We were interested in selling some products. There was some American
                    business involvement in the pharmaceutical industry, Ever-ready batteries and
                    other small businesses, but no large scale interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: One of the things I benefited from was that I was able to establish a
                    good personal relationship with Mrs. Bandaranaike. I haven't kept up with her
                    that closely, but I did send her a letter just a couple of months ago through
                    Marion Creekmore, who is our new Ambassador there. I received a very nice letter
                    back from her last week. I think it was felt by people serving there at the
                    time, and I have heard subsequently, that my relationship with the top people in
                    the government was a good one and it did contribute to positive U.S.-Sri Lanka
                    relations. Having said that, I am not suggesting that the personal part of the
                    equation was by any means the entire reason. There were other factors. One was
                    the fact that relationships were already beginning to improve before I arrived.
                    Second, I think Mrs. Bandaranaike saw the United States over time, not
                    initially, as an off-set to the Soviets and the Chinese. She was concerned about
                    the left wing elements within her own Cabinet. She had real problems with the
                    Trotskyites in particular. To the extent that we were seen as a countervailing
                    force to an increase of Chinese or Soviet influence, she saw the U.S.-Sri Lanka
                    connection more positively than when she first came to power. I benefited from
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>There were several instances in which Prime Minister Bandaranaike supported the
                    U.S. position, even though it caused strains in her Cabinet. Her Finance
                    Minister, for example, was a Trotskyite—a member of the LLSP party which
                    purported to follow the teachings of Leon Trotsky. On that strange little
                    island, the Trotskyites had three Cabinet posts, including the very important
                    Finance portfolio—held by N.M. Perera, who was known as the “Golden Brain.” I
                    got along with these people pretty well. You have to know Sri Lanka to really
                    appreciate this; even though these people would attack you in the press, they
                    would come around in the evening to your receptions and drink your liquor. It
                    was a pleasant environment in terms of personal relationships which could
                    sometime take the sharp edges off the political attacks. So these people, on an
                    individual basis, were by no means antagonistic, but they did not want to see
                    Sri Lanka tied too closely to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In looking at some of the reports, there seemed to have
                        considerable press repression during the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: There was some. The press was reasonably free at the time. One of the
                    things about the three countries in South Asia in which I served—India, Pakistan
                    and Sri Lanka—is that all of them in a way derived advantages from the fact that
                    they gained independence from the British. Whatever one thinks about the British
                    Empire, it established well organized structures of government, endorsed the
                    rule of law and permitted active political participation in the latter stages of
                    its rule. This meant that when these countries became independent they had
                    already had some democratic experience. That doesn't mean that Pakistan wasn't
                    under military rule for much of its history; it doesn't mean that Sri Lanka
                    hasn't hedged its democracy in recent years; it doesn't mean that India did not
                    go through a two-year emergency period. But over-all the British heritage was a
                    positive factor in the post-independence environments of those countries. For
                    American diplomats, that made those countries very interesting to serve in.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>In the case of Sri Lanka, we also benefited from the fact that many Sri Lankans,
                    in the immediate post-World War II period, were very well educated—more so than
                    now. They later de-emphasized English and since 1983 the country has been torn
                    apart by the Tamil-Sinhalese dispute and, more recently, by a revival of the
                    leftist Sinhalese JVP group. These conflicts were not as prominent when I was
                    there. There was an under-current of tension between the minority Tamils—who
                    lived essentially in the north and east and who were Hindus—and the Sinhalese
                    who were in the central and southern part of the Island who were Buddhists. This
                    tension was manifested most directly in the assassination of the Mayor of Jaffna
                    whom I called on when I went there. He was killed a couple of months later as a
                    reflection of the feeling between the Tamil and the Sinhalese communities. While
                    I was in Sri Lanka between 1972 and 1976, the domestic scene was reasonably
                    stable and it is therefore upsetting to me to read about the developments in Sri
                    Lanka since 1983. My period in Sri Lanka was very pleasant. My wife, Eliza, and
                    I had our three young children with us and we look back on it as a very
                    enjoyable period. Two of my children have returned to Sri Lanka for visits and
                    we all have an attachment to the island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when we left rather ignominiously from
                        Vietnam. How did that play in Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It played well and the U.S. opening to China also played well. The
                    interesting thing was that partly because of the Nixon opening to China, partly
                    because of what was perceived properly as Nixon's less-than-warm feeling toward
                    India, Mrs. Bandaranaike, leader of the left- center Freedom Party and Richard
                    Nixon got along quite well in their one meeting in Washington which I attended.
                    I can remember the great difficulty I had trying to explain to the government
                    what “Watergate” was all about and why Nixon had resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had the same trouble in Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: The meeting between the two leaders in Washington, and the Nixon
                    policy toward China and the rather cool U.S.-Indian relationship were three
                    factors that tended to make the U.S.-Sri Lanka relationships under Nixon quite
                    good. That continued during the Ford period. That explains in part the concern
                    when Nixon left the scene. The U.S. was no longer the country that Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike had run against in her election in the early part of the decade.
                    The Sri Lankans did not understand “Watergate”. They had their own problems of
                    corruption, etc. but they could never fathom, and I could never successfully
                    explain, what “Watergate” was all about or why the President of the United
                    States had to resign. One of my jobs, of course, was to reassure them—and I
                    tried to do this again and again—that under Gerald Ford, the new President, the
                    relationship between our two countries would continue to be good. I did get out
                    of the Ford White House an invitation to Mrs. Bandaranaike to visit Washington.
                    She was never able to do it before Ford left office, but the fact that he did
                    invite her was helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Another element of U.S. interest in Sri Lanka was that as late as early and
                    mid-70s, the Non-Aligned movement had a certain clout to it—I don't want to over
                    state it—and Sri Lanka, for its size, was playing a fairly important role in
                    that movement. In fact, one of the Non-Aligned summit meetings was held in Sri
                    Lanka—after I left.</p>
                <p>To re-cap, I would say that the U.S. relationship with Sri Lanka—a relationship
                    between a major power and a small country—is a good example of a relationship in
                    which ideology over time gave way to pragmatism, assisted by the international
                    environment and by personalities. I don't take credit for the improvement,
                    although I did have unusually good relations with many of the senior officials
                    of the Sri Lankan government. There was also the strange Nixon- Bandaranaike
                    relationship which wasn't long-standing-based— one visit—but it did underscore
                    that the personal equation, which is hard to weigh, is important. It can, of
                    course, work the other way as well. When Indira Gandhi came to the States in
                    1971, according to Henry Kissinger in his book, it was the worst meeting Richard
                    Nixon had with any foreign leader. That was a case in which the chemistry didn't
                    work, but in the case of Mrs. Bandaranaike it did work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the relationship of Sri Lanka with India during
                        your period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: It was reasonably satisfactory. Historically, there had been a good
                    relationship between the Nehru and the Bandaranaike families. Both represented
                    the Brahmins of their respective countries. The Nehrus are, in fact, high caste
                    Brahmins under the Hindu caste system; although in Buddhist Sri Lanka
                    technically there is no caste system, the Bandaranaikes were high caste
                    Buddhists. Partly because of the family relationship, the relations between the
                    two countries were reasonably good. There has always, however, been an
                    underlying tension between the huge Indian land mass to the north and the little
                    island of Sri Lanka hanging off to the south. That problem has been accentuated
                    by the fact that about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population is Tamil. Forty
                    million people in South India are basically the same people ethnically and
                    culturally. Thus, you have within Sri Lanka a Tamil minority which has
                    increasingly felt oppressed by the Sinhalese majority, and that minority has
                    sought support from across the Palk Strait in India. In quite a different
                    context, there are some similarities between the Sri Lankan situation and the
                    Cyprus situation in the sense that the Turkish Cypriot minority seeks protection
                    through its relationship with mainland Turkey. The Tamils have done the same
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The relationship between India and Sri Lanka in recent years has deteriorated
                    sharply because of the Indian military intervention into Sri Lanka two and half
                    years ago. This has strengthened Sinhalese national elements who want to get the
                    Indians out. The present Indian government has indicated that it will withdraw
                    its troops shortly. But the intervention in Sri Lanka, even though it came
                    through a formal agreement between Rajiv Gandhi and J. R. Jayawardene, the
                    current President of Sri Lanka, nonetheless brought about a rekindling of all
                    the Sri Lanka-India strains. The sooner the Indians pull out, the better the
                    relationship will be.</p>
                <p>I might just add as a footnote that I also had the unusual experience of being an
                    Ambassador accredited to a second country—the Republic of the Maldives. That is
                    a country consisting of two thousand islands, two hundred of which are
                    populated, located in the Indian Ocean southwest of Sri Lanka. I was therefore
                    also Ambassador to the Maldives. We had no resident representation at that time.
                    I visited there officially three or four times and went there once on a
                    vacation. These days there are not many dual accreditations. There are some in
                    the Pacific islands, but it is rare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have interests in the Maldives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Very few. At one time, the British used to stage aircraft through Gan
                    in the Southern Maldives. Our basic interest is to ensure Maldivan independence
                    and to discourage others from moving in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you left in 1976, you came back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Yes. I ran the Senior Seminar for two years. It is the equivalent of
                    the Defense Department's National War College although much smaller. In my days
                    there, 1976-78, it had about twenty-five members of the Seminar. My last tour
                    was in the Inspection Corps for a year. I inspected several posts in Central
                    America, two in East Asia—Korea and Indonesia—and I also inspected the Arabian
                    Peninsula posts. I retired in October 1979. I have three jobs since then. First,
                    I went to the Carnegie Endowment. Now, I am at the Middle East Institute. I have
                    been here for almost three years as the Vice-President. My tour in the
                    Inspection Corps was valuable to me later in my retirement period because it
                    took me to the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf—an area that I did not know a
                    great deal about previously, but I learned quite a bit about over several months
                    there. Since I retired, I have felt comfortable dealing with Arabian Peninsula
                    and Gulf issues, though these were not issues I had been directly involved in
                    during my career.</p>

                        of all, looking back on your career, what gave you the greatest

                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: Although it is hard to pick out a single period, I would say that I
                    derived my greatest satisfaction dealing with international political issues,
                    which I had been interested in from the time I was a young man. I was very
                    interested in domestic politics in school and college; I received a Ph.D. in
                    Political Science from John Hopkins and the Foreign Service was an excellent
                    opportunity to carry forward interests that I had developed as a young man. I
                    particularly enjoyed the diversity of the assignments- -the fact that one moved
                    periodically. I like the diversity; I liked the fact that at the end of three or
                    four years you moved on to something else and overall, I found it a very
                    fulfilling and stimulating career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If someone comes to you today and asks you about the
                        Foreign Service as a career, what advise would you give?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VAN HOLLEN: The Foreign Service today is very different from the one that I
                    joined in 1951. If you had interviewed people in 1951, they, of course, would
                    have said that the Foreign Service was far different from the one that existed
                    in the 1920s. To state the obvious, it is much less of an elitist institution;
                    it is much more diversified in terms of the people; it is a much larger Service
                    and contains many more women; it covers a lot more countries than it did in 1951
                    even though that was a period of blossoming for the Service. So in terms of the
                    nature of the Foreign Service itself and in terms of the number of countries, it
                    is quite different. Second, the issues are much broader than the bilateral
                    ones—political, economic, consular. The whole field of science and technology,
                    environment—all of these are new issues, which are reflected in the staffing and
                    structure of the Department. They are reflected in the new expertise required. I
                    am not sure the Department has fully adjusted to this. In many ways, the
                    heartland of the Department remains the Geographic Bureaus. Despite the emphasis
                    on the importance of the economic officers, the political officer route is still
                    often seen as the way to the top, although that is changing.</p>
                <p>I would say that the position of the Foreign Service wife is very different from
                    when I joined. I was very fortunate in that my wife, Eliza Farnsworth, whom I
                    married in 1953, shared my interests in foreign affairs. She followed me
                    dutifully around the world, post after post, even though she had an MA in
                    Russian studies from Harvard and had little opportunity to pursue her
                    substantive interests. When I was assigned to India, Pakistan, Turkey or Sri
                    Lanka, she picked up and went, later with the children. I don't think that is
                    true to the same degree today. That is one of the major differences in the
                    Foreign Service. It is not as easy now when many wives want a career of their
                    own. We have been very fortunate.</p>

                <p>Just before I retired, my wife got a job in the Department in Intelligence and
                    Research (INR)—I had nothing to do with it—dealing with a country very few
                    people cared about, called Afghanistan. This was 1978, a year before the Soviets
                    invaded Afghanistan. Last year she was named Director of the South Asian
                    division of the Bureau. So she has had her own successful career independently
                    of me for over ten years. But often it is not easy. It can be done under some
                    tandem assignments if the wife is also a Foreign Service officer, but I think
                    the position of the wife of a Foreign Service officer now is different and
                    perhaps more difficult than it used to be.</p>
