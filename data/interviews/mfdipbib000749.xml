                <p>Interviewed by: Lambert (Nick) Heyniger and Vladimir Lehovich</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 3, 1997</p>

                <p>[Begin Section with Nick Heyniger]</p>
                <p>Q: I am interviewing William Harrison Marsh, Bill Marsh, about his thirty-plus
                    years in the Foreign Service. Bill, let's start off by your telling us where and
                    when you were born and where you grew up.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Nick, welcome and thank you for this opportunity.</p>
                <p>I was born in Pennsylvania and grew up there and in Michigan and found really no
                    roots until after graduate school when I was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I went to high school in Detroit, Michigan to a very remarkable public
                    high school. Four years of French, for example, were obligatory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful. That's what people want to know. And then from
                        theryou went where to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I went to Cornell University from 1949 to 1953. I was a mid year entrant,
                    which created a great deal of confusion when I took the second half of courses
                    first, and then the first half, particularly in the case of history courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What fields were you mainly studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The government department at Cornell at that time was quite renowned. It
                    included truly extraordinary people like Clinton Rossiter and Mario Einaudi,
                    whose son, of course, was Ambassador Einaudi, and others, Herbert Briggs and so
                    forth. So I graduated in 1953 with a degree in government, a bachelor of arts
                    with honors in government.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I then had to wait because this was my first truly bureaucratic
                    experience. I graduated about 10 days after President Eisenhower's inauguration.
                    In those days we had to take ROTC at Cornell, for two years and I had finished
                    my two years about three weeks before the Korean War began. So then those of us,
                    and I would say it was about 98 percent of us, who had decided not to go on to
                    advanced ROTC rushed to sign up and took the additional two years and we then
                    were commissioned and were to be called up. But President Eisenhower put a hold
                    on the play so that instead of going in, say, in February or March of 1953,
                    something of that sort, it was not until August of '53 that I went into the Air
                    Force to do my two-year stint.</p>
                <p>That meant that I spent some six months with my parents, returning home to them,
                    and by this time they had moved to Dallas, Texas. My father was transferred
                    frequently by his company. So I became a floorwalker at Neiman-Marcus at that
                    time, which is quite another story and very interesting, and then went off to be
                    sworn in and all of that near San Francisco. I was considered by having been
                    resident, albeit temporarily, west of the Mississippi River to be Pacific
                    oriented rather than Atlantic oriented. So most of my classmates went to Europe.
                    I did not, I went to Japan and spent my whole two year tour in Japan, with a
                    marvelous job as aide de camp to the Commanding General of the Far East Air
                    Forces and an opportunity to study Japanese at the embassy under Eleanor
                    Jorden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the Air Force officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The last one was General Earl Partridge. He was the Commander. I was a
                    junior aide to him and a senior aide to Major General Kenneth McNaughton, who
                    was deputy commander of Far East Air Forces. In those days Far East Air Forces
                    extended from roughly the operational area of Thailand on the west, Australia
                    and New Zealand on the south and everything in the Pacific north of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, Bill, you also mentioned that you worked with
                        somebody ithe embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. Well, Eleanor Jorden taught Japanese. She was an extraordinary
                    teacher/instructor and came later to head the Far Eastern Languages Department
                    of FSI. It was a remarkable course of language instruction. Never before or
                    since have I taken anything like that. I was in my early twenties and I
                    remembered stuff in those days with relative ease. I became quite good in
                    conversational Japanese. I never studied the writing or the reading of it, but
                    still conversationally I was quite good. But it was an introduction to life
                    abroad because until that time the only foreign travel that I had had was on the
                    New York Central between Buffalo and Detroit and vice versa going to and from
                    college via Canadal�.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Q: Okay, so now you've graduated from Cornell and you've had two and a half years
                    in the Air Force. It's now 1955 and you are discharged from the Air Force. What
                    happens now?</p>
                <p>MARSH: What happens now is that I had decided that I liked living abroad very
                    much indeed. It was fascinating and all that. The embassies were very
                    interesting. And by the way, Ambassador John Allison was very kind to me. We
                    happened to meet so I was invited to a couple of stag dinners that he gave at
                    the embassy. There I was with very, very senior officers, I'm a second
                    lieutenant, for example at a dinner given for Senator Earl Clements of Kentucky,
                    and that sort of thing. I don't know, I have a feeling I was regarded as
                    something of a boy Mozart there before the crowned heads.</p>
                <p>But in any event they were very, very kind to me and then I came to know Mrs.
                    Allison very well, so then I was invited to dinners that were not stag. They
                    were very kind and remarkable people and I was very much impressed with
                    them.</p>
                <p>I also came to know the French ambassador, whose name was L�vy and who was the
                    epitome of the wry and skillful French ambassador. The particular question that
                    I was working out was that of visas and passports for American military
                    personnel who were going to the Associated States of Indochina during the time
                    of the French conflict with the Vietnamese. I worked out a procedure whereby we
                    could shortcut the three-month lag that it had taken to get air crews visas to
                    help the French in Indochina. Passports were moving from Tokyo to Saigon on to
                    Paris and then back to Tokyo again. We managed to work out some shortcuts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually the French received the passport at the French
                        embassin Tokyo and sent it along to Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct and then to Paris for counter-signature anthen back. We're
                    talking about the time of Dien Bien Phu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing, absolutely amazing!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now we are sort of at the end of your Air Force experience. Yoliked living and
                    working abroad, so what did you do then?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Actually I carried out something I had inquired about earlier, namely
                    graduate studies in international affairs. Now while in Dallas I applied for a
                    scholarship that was available solely to residents of Dallas, though I was
                    hardly a very authentic Texan, to the School of Advanced International Studies
                    and got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Johns Hopkins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct. When they said it was really for native Texans I said that
                    I wasn't there by accident but by choice and that seemed to have some telling
                    influence on them. The other possibility in my eyes was the Woodrow Wilson
                    School at Princeton. Thus in '54, I began preparations to go to Princeton
                    because I'd decided that was where I wanted to go and entered in the fall of
                    '55, with your good self.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. We were classmates at Princeton. Just tell me a thing or two about how
                    you evaluated your two years at Princeton, what you thought you got out of it
                    and how it could have been better.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Magnificent, and in some ways very unfortunate, because in all subsequent
                    training I compared it with the Woodrow Wilson School of those days and always
                    found the later educational forays deficient by comparison. I thought it was
                    remarkable. It was amazingly full of information, of course, and wisdom but also
                    it was vast exposure to the liberal arts and to the human condition. So I found
                    it extremely valuable.</p>
                <p>There was a course for example in economic development that was absolutely
                    magnificent in the why and wherefore and all that sort of thing. It stood me in
                    good stead for many, many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who any of the professors were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You know my memory is quite a bit rusty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marion L�vy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Not Marion L�vy in this course, but I remember him, of course, and so do
                    you. Steve Bailey was the Dean, he was remarkable. Remarkable. I remember one
                    time we had a professor from the Institute for Advanced Study who came over to
                    give us a complete discussion on, this is in an evening lecture, the great Grand
                    Inquisitor scene from the Brothers Karamazov. Perhaps you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I was another year. Sounds like fun, though.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MARSH: That was extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary. It was an examination of
                    the philosophical implications particularly with respect to freedom and
                    responsibility. It was absolutely amazing.</p>
                <p>So it was a wonderful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it is 1957 and you've emerged from Princeton armed
                        with youMaster of Public Affairs and what's the next step?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, in December of '56 I had taken the Foreign Service exam, the written
                    examination. I had passed it. So the question was whether to go into the Foreign
                    Service, which was about all I had envisioned. I wasn't really considering very
                    many options, or to humor my family that urged me to go to work for a Foundation
                    headed by a relative. This sounds quaint these days, but at any rate I listened
                    to my family and did what they suggested and decided I would put the Foreign
                    Service on hold. Thus I looked to coming into the Foreign Service in '59, let's
                    say, something of that sort. But I'd give it two years in Pittsburgh, where this
                    Foundation was located.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Foundation was in Pittsburgh? What was the name of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was a taxpayers' organization in a sense called the Pennsylvania
                    Economy League. The League really was backed by the major industrialists of
                    Pittsburgh who had a rather unusual coalition going between themselves and the
                    Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh, David Lawrence, who was a union man. He had come
                    up through the unions. So you had business and unions working together to try to
                    revive and clean up and expand the Pittsburgh area. Obviously you needed
                    industrial leadership for that. You also needed labor peace and this was quite a
                    remarkable concord that they had worked out to great advantage. They rebuilt the
                    city and they did preserve its industrial base, albeit not the blue-collar one
                    but the white-collar one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your responsibilities in working for the Foundation
                        included whakinds of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The basic idea behind what the Foundation did was that the Foundation
                    would quietly encourage governmental institutions to request that the League do
                    a study for them on the feasibility of such and such, and such and such. Now
                    this might involve something that a public official wanted to do and the way he
                    was interested either in having it done the most economical and effective way,
                    or it might be to put across some idea that the League was espousing at that
                    time in order to have a more effective approach to governmental problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>An example of the latter was that the League was very interested in having a
                    overarching non-governmental organization that would see to hospital planning in
                    order to prevent the tremendous duplication and the streams of multiple
                    fundraising that were always hitting the corporations, the banks, the others in
                    the town. So we set up something called the Hospital Planning Association of
                    Western Pennsylvania in the 1950s. I would say it was certainly 40 years ahead
                    of its time. It's just now catching on, this sort of idea, elsewhere. But the
                    idea is that you should not have five million-dollar pieces of equipment every
                    two blocks along Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, at the various hospitals, each of
                    them used an hour a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of rationalizing...organizing the delivery of health
                        care.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Precisely.</p>
                <p>Now I was also, by the way, an ex officio member of the Board of Education. I was
                    there to pass on the school district's budget and financial planning and all of
                    that kind of thing. That was very useful as acquisition of budgetary and
                    financial work and also it was an exercise in practical politics that I found
                    invaluable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular personalities that you enjoyed working for
                        oworking with, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I mentioned Mayor Lawrence who was an extraordinary man. Of course
                    Lawrence later became governor of Pennsylvania. I enjoyed working with my
                    colleagues. I worked really with an enormous number of people, one I'm thinking
                    of is an industrialist named William Rea, who was the chairman of the school
                    board. The interesting thing is, as chairman of the school board he didn't have
                    any children in the public schools. He had his children in private schools, in
                    prep schools there, but was serving strictly for the community. It was a
                    wonderful example of public service.</p>
                <p>I knew some judges, as well, who were very interesting men and who suffered
                    greatly by not having very broad-based staffs. One time there was a question
                    about the waterfront of Pittsburgh and a particular judge was going to put
                    through certain rulings that would oblige the city to do a massive cleanup
                    effort all along the waterfront.</p>
                <p>Q: Is this the time, if my memory serves me right, where the river sort of
                    flowing through Pittsburgh actually caught fire, was that then?</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MARSH: You are in the right diocese but the wrong parish! That was actually
                    Cleveland, and it was the Cuyahoga river and it was actually much later that it
                    caught fire. But at any rate I knew another judge and we had lunch from time to
                    time, remember there was a 40 year difference in our ages, and he asked me what
                    I thought about this. I said I didn't understand it because all this flotsam and
                    jetsam, steamboats and barges and whatnot and so forth that he wanted to
                    eliminate from the Pittsburgh waterfront was the sort of thing people paid good
                    money to go see in New Orleans and St. Louis and Louisville. He thought it over
                    and never issued the ruling. So perhaps I had a little influence at that time, I
                    don't know.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, I think it was very important for one undertaking a Foreign
                    Service career to have some domestic experience and particularly in practical
                    politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Another thing is that Tip O'Neill, of course, once said that all politics
                    is local. I don't know whether that is the case or not, I haven't decided, but
                    suffice it to say that a great deal of politics is local and that extends to
                    foreign policies as well.</p>
                <p>Incidentally there was a major theme in the Pittsburgh mayoral election in 1959,
                    I guess it was, and that was U.S. policy toward Lebanon. Now what that had to do
                    with being mayor of Pittsburgh was that there was an influential and articulate
                    Lebanese-American community in Pittsburgh. They wanted the United States to
                    pursue a certain line and the mayor though it was politic to support this and to
                    pursue it. He needed those votes. He did follow that. I don't need to tell you
                    that you who served in Arab countries, as have I, that the friends and opponents
                    of Israel have always been contending at local levels and state levels and that
                    sort of thing. It's brought foreign policy issues very much to the fore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we are now coming up to 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Let us not pass 1959, because something didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In 1958 there was no Foreign Service examination. And of course we have to
                    go, what, more than 35 years until the next time no Foreign Service examination
                    was held, but at any rate it derailed my train.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that? Why was there no Foreign Service exam in
                        '58?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MARSH: Need I tell you? Money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No appropriation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Nope. Well, no, there just was not enough money to bring isome new
                    help.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that is very significant and I think that is something that really
                    should be emphasized in our interview that for an entire year, not too long ago,
                    the Department of State was unable to bring in any new people.</p>
                <p>MARSH: That sort of brackets my own career that is from 1960 to 1996. It is sort
                    of bracketed by these two events. But on the other hand, I do not remember any
                    time during my career when there was not a shortage of cash. I do not remember
                    any time when people said well, this year we can spend reasonably and carefully
                    and intelligently. Instead it has always been yet another plea for
                    frugality.</p>
                <p>Q: But this occurrence in 1958 where the Department didn't feel that it could
                    even hold the exam, as you say, was quite rare and it meant you spent another
                    year in Pittsburgh?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That's exactly what it meant. I began to think it was a deliberate plot
                    directed against me because I don't think it had happened before since the great
                    Depression. It had been years since that sort of thing happened. It's rather
                    scandalous that they have to resort to such things but so it was. Also, I had to
                    take the written examination again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They would not carry over the success of 1956, so I had ttake the written
                    examination again in '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not? You had talked with them in 1956 after you passed
                        thwritten examination.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. But you must start all over again. So I started all over
                    again. In December of '59 I took the written again, and took the orals in April
                    of 1960 in Washington. And then they said they'd let me know. They said, and
                    remember in those days we had eight grades, I would come in certainly as an
                    FSO-7, but probably as a FSO-6 because I had a master's, military experience and
                    government-related experience. So that seemed nice.</p>
                <p>Anyway, in the summer sometime I received word that in two weeks I was to report
                    for duty. I wrote them back and said that was impossible, I had to give more
                    than two weeks notice. The League was a relatively small organization and didn't
                    have that many people with advanced degrees in public administration and
                    governmental affairs and so forth. I then received word that I would come in to
                    the class that would meet just after Thanksgiving in 1960, November 30th, I
                    think it was, as an FSO-8.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the assurances that your military
                        experience anyour graduate study, what happened to all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Indeed. Indeed. I came in at the top of an FSO-8. I asked about the other
                    and a wall of silence descended. So it was the first time of what the
                    Declaration of Independence calls a long train of abuses in which promises, good
                    faith, were broken and I was completely unused to this sort of thing. I had
                    never encountered it in the private sphere, which is supposed to be the very
                    center of inequity in the world, where because of the competitive factor people
                    do and say anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have now reached sort of the end of 1960 and you have
                        entereinto the Department. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I went to a basement because I went to A-100 in the garage of
                    Arlington Towers and, frankly, I found this very strange. In my Air Force days
                    we had always had marvelous accommodations, remember, General's office,
                    Commanding General's office, aide-de-camp, all that sort of thing. When we
                    traveled around to Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, wherever we went, Korea
                    very frequently, everything was very posh, very plush. Then the Foundation had
                    beautiful offices in downtown Pittsburgh in a marvelous French renaissance
                    building with a wonderful central atrium, a gorgeous building. It was very close
                    to department stores, hotels and fine restaurants and so on.</p>
                <p>Incidentally when I was in Tokyo with the Air Force I was right in downtown
                    Tokyo. For what it's worth, I'll put this in; one of the most difficult things
                    for me about Foggy Bottom was that it was so suburban. I didn't have the sense
                    that I was in a central city at all. There were no bookstores to browse in
                    during lunchtime, no good restaurants worthy of the name; there were a few
                    places but nothing very decent.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>There was no place to go for a little break.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time there weren't even many skyscrapers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, heavens, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in Rosslyn, 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. What I'm saying is I was completely unused to this sort of suburban
                    locale, whether it be the Department of State headquarters or the Arlington
                    Towers. At any rate I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did the A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Did the A-100 course, which was a very good course, but was remarkably
                    brief. As a preparation for diplomacy, four weeks didn't seem terribly long.</p>
                <p>I was told, since I was 29 years old, I was one of the old boys really to come
                    aboard. We had one fellow who couldn't get sworn in, Bob Ryan, because he wasn't
                    21. He had to wait to be sworn in. So I was one of the old boys. I talked with
                    the advisors and said I'd really like to learn the folkways and the mores of the
                    Department of State, so I'd like a Department assignment.</p>
                <p>Absolutely not, they said, you need to go to a small post, perhaps a two or three
                    man post. (That's the sort of terminology they used in those days, they didn't
                    say a two or three person post.) They said I would learn post operation and do
                    everything so I shouldn't even think about it, I would go overseas. Came the
                    famous day when they read off the assignments...it was the Department. I was so
                    amenable in those days that I was disappointed when I got the Department
                    assignment, which was what I had sought in the first place! Remarkable. I would
                    say I was much more other-directed, perhaps, than are the young people today.
                    That was due to the very tight trio of family, school and church and later to
                    military discipline and the traditional kinds of universities where you behaved
                    yourself. You didn't question and so forth.</p>
                <p>So they gave me my assignment that I had originally wanted and remember this
                    terrible letdown feeling that I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MARSH: I went to the Aviation Division in the Bureau of Economic Affairs. There
                    was a remarkable man who was the Director of the office, Henry Taft Snowden. He
                    was a grandson of President Taft. This fellow was about 6'5”, I'd say, thin as a
                    rail, very aristocratic. His manner was well below room temperature, is the way
                    I'd say it. Junior officers arriving were treated pretty much as children. They
                    should be seen but not heard, they should behave themselves, should do as they
                    were told, keep out of the way, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of the Aviation Division?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he have you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: What he had me doing was Latin American air transport agreements. I knew
                    very little about Latin America and absolutely nothing about air transport
                    agreements. He said he wanted me to revise the draft agreement with Brazil. That
                    was that. There was no training and so forth. I had to ask a great deal of
                    questions. It was, you know, when we reach the end of the dock I'm going to push
                    you in and you'll either swim or not swim. It all depends.</p>
                <p>(My wife, at the Agency, you know which agency, when she in her turn went to work
                    there was given a Russian dictionary and a group of Soviet newspapers and they
                    said, “learn Russian.”)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take just a second and get up to date on that. Where
                        anwhen were you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: We were married in May of 1962 here in Washington having met very soon
                    after I arrived in Washington, about 18 months previous to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she had a job at the Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: She did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So there you are in the Aviation Division revising
                        thagreement with Brazil. How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, it was sort of a trap because there hadn't been any aviation
                    agreement with Brazil. They'd never been going to sign one. So what he was
                    saying in effect, although I didn't know it at the time, was rewrite it, maybe I
                    could come up with something that would be agreeable with the Brazilians. The
                    last I checked, which was in the early '80s perhaps, or something, there still
                    wasn't an air transport agreement with Brazil, I don't think. It had never come
                    to pass because it was too much a restriction on the military in Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you had a chance both to talk with the people on
                        the Brazil desk and did you have a chance to talk with anyone from the
                        Brazilian embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No and no. Because these highly technical agreements, number one, had
                    their own sort of logic. Talking about this with the Brazilian embassy or the
                    Brazil desk there would be the feeling that it would reach, talking with one, it
                    would reach the other and that is not what was wanted. Besides which I learned
                    very thoroughly at that time that functional bureaus did not consider themselves
                    in the same arena or league with geographic bureaus. Therefore we should get
                    everything we wanted together in the functional bureau and then ambush the
                    geographic bureau, as it were, with the fait accompli, here we go, here it is,
                    sign!</p>
                <p>Q: That is a great insight. I'm delighted that we got that down. But how were you
                    supposed to arrive at sort of the finished draft of an aviation treaty with
                    Brazil if you'd never had the chance to talk either with the Brazilians or with
                    the people in the Department that were supposed to know about Brazil.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Indeed. But I'd asked myself if perhaps this wasn't some bizarre sort of
                    learning exercise. I really wasn't terribly sure. Actually the people with whom
                    one talked, and this was another bit of insight that I got from it really, you
                    were supposed to talk with the Civil Aeronautics Board, Americans. You weren't
                    supposed to talk with the Brazil desk or the Brazilian embassy. You are going to
                    say wait a minute, those are Americans on the Brazil desk, but as far as the
                    functional bureaus were concerned there was some question as to whether those on
                    the geographic desks were really fully fledged Americans or not! But in any
                    event I pursued my work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk with anybody on the CAB?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: CAB, which has since, of course, dissolved. Q: Who told you what they
                    wanted out of a treaty?</p>
                <p>MARSH: They told me what they wanted. They, of course, were really the
                    mouthpieces for the airlines. So what the airlines wanted the CAB wanted and
                    what the airlines didn't want - you got it.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other highlights of your tour in AV that we should
                        hear about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, yes, I think there were distinct possibilities. It's interesting
                    work; I've always been interested in transportation, particularly in the
                    airlines. But one thing that I would mention was that at the time of the Cuban
                    missile crisis, I was drawing pretty much to a close with my work in AV. You
                    remember that this crisis was pretty closely held. We knew there was a problem,
                    we knew there was friction, I mean the general public, but didn't really know
                    how close we were to war. No sense of it until this was finally revealed.</p>
                <p>So at the end they did announce we had reached an agreement with Khrushchev. It
                    was maintaining the peace for the time being, and therefor the great threat of
                    war had passed, ta-dah, ta-dah, and all that sort of thing, I said to some of my
                    bosses that this was really a very remarkable thing. Had anybody passed the
                    threat information to the airlines? If they hadn't passed it to me, had they
                    alerted Panagra, Pan American, Eastern, etc., etc., etc., Braniff, all the other
                    airlines, which of course all of which were over-flying Cuba throughout the
                    great crisis? And so here they were with a total paranoid in charge of the Cuban
                    State down below and overflights going umpteen times a day, to and fro. Their
                    reaction was shocked because they hadn't thought of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody had thought to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No one had thought. It's extraordinary. If you took a plane from Bogota to
                    Miami during the Cuban missile crisis you went right over central Cuba.</p>
                <p>Q: Any by this time we were in jets, I think. So by the time you are over Cuba
                    you are already descending in altitude to make your landing in Miami.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, which is 90 miles from Havana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are not that far overhead Cuba and these are like
                        tecivilian airlines passing over every day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And nobody is saying anything to anyone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Nobody thought of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, this is one of the limitations, unfortunately, of White House
                    foreign policy. We complain frequently that there are so many people in the act,
                    there are so many people we have to deal with and so forth, but there are so
                    many interests at stake. There are so many risks that are possible. Imagine if a
                    couple of American jets had been shot down? Then the blockade option might not
                    have been the preferred option but instead a military strike might well have
                    ensued.</p>
                <p>Q: I can take your point that the White House was in real crisis mode and wanted
                    this thing held fairly tightly. But, I mean, surely people in Washington
                    including the State Department and the CAB and the airlines knew that something
                    was going on, didn't they?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, of course, Secretary Rusk attended all of the meetings, or at least
                    most of them, that were held at the White House and that sort of thing.
                    Occasionally he was accompanied by the Under Secretary for Political Affairs or
                    someone of that sort, but you know no individual can think of everything and
                    particularly when you are indeed the great 'omnium gatherum' of the world, the
                    one universal power in every way. We are so vulnerable on so many fronts. We
                    found that out in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a very good point. That was two years in the
                        Departmenof State, from 1960 to 1962 and I guess you are due for
                        reassignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, something intervened, as a matter of fact. I was called to a rather
                    mysterious meeting in either the summer or tail of '62. I found an awful lot of
                    people there. All of us were junior officers and all of us with French-speaking
                    capability. The conveners of the meeting announced there was to be a great
                    intensification of the U.S. effort in Vietnam. All of us had been screened and
                    were found quite eligible for special training in the Vietnamese language, both
                    in Washington and in Saigon. And then assignment to various field posts that
                    were to be set up in Vietnam in order to give a kind of geographic coverage to
                    the U.S. effort there. In other words, we did not want to be restricted to
                    Saigon, the capital.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a meeting of junior officers being informed there was a growing and
                    important need for people to go to Southeast Asia? How did that go?</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MARSH: There were mixed reactions to it. In the first instance we were told that
                    we had been culled before this pool not solely because of our French language
                    capability and the appropriate rank and level and so forth, but also because we
                    were all unmarried. And immediately, half of the group said, “What do you mean,
                    unmarried? We are married.” It developed that the marriages that had taken place
                    in fiscal 1962 had not been recorded and, as a matter of fact, as late as 1966
                    they still were carrying me as a single officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For Heaven's sake!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I had a hell of a time to get tickets and a passport for my wife in '63
                    going to Saigon and in '66 returning from Bangkok, where she was in safehaven.
                    By that time we had a son. (Some officious person in the Department) when I
                    telephoned from Saigon to the Department to complain that the orders had only
                    covered me and not covered my wife and son, when I told her that she said, “But
                    you're not married.” And I said that of course we were, we had a son. Well, this
                    functionary informed me that it was not necessary to be married to have a child.
                    An interesting biology lesson from a total incompetent!</p>
                <p>But in any event a number of people, for example, Jim Bishop was one who later
                    was very active in African affairs and ambassador to several countries, said
                    well, on balance, he'd rather not go. The rest acted according to their
                    individual consciences, who were married. I was married but I did talk to some
                    people about the assignment and they said it was a golden opportunity and that
                    it would really be exciting and blah, blah, blah...and a grateful nation...blah,
                    blah, blah...all that sort of thing. In any event I did go into Vietnamese
                    language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the fall of '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, the very beginning of '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, all right, how long did that last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was six months back in the basement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are at FSI studying Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I am. A little earlier I said that the course I had taken under Eleanor
                    Jorden in Japanese, at the embassy in Tokyo in the '50s was very fine, very well
                    done. So I was completely unprepared for the totally disorganized experience in
                    Vietnamese at the FSI.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>It was bedlam. We were put under linguists and I think we had seven linguists in
                    six months, something of that sort. They'd change. A very few of them were
                    Vietnamese speakers. So their approach was a wholly mechanical approach to
                    Vietnamese, you know you hold your tongue such and such a way, do this, do that
                    and the other kind of thing and so forth, but as far as any practical facility
                    with Vietnamese, they didn't have it. It was an extremely unsatisfactory
                    course.</p>
                <p>Q: I've also had hard language training at FSI. When you say linguist... what I
                    mean by linguist is sort of the supervisor who is supervising five or six
                    language classes being taught by instructors.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Precisely.</p>
                <p>Q: The instructors are native speakers of Vietnamese but the linguists who are
                    supervising don't really have much familiarity with the language at all.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Almost none. They disagreed with one another. There was a great deal of
                    tension and rivalry and all of that sort of thing. My friend Vlad Lehovich was
                    in the class, as was Dick Holbrooke as well as quite a few other notables.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Holbrooke as a language student?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Fair. Holbrooke has always been a master politician. His career is his
                    supreme artistic achievement of his life and he has devoted his life to this
                    professional equivalent of Sistine Chapel ceiling here still being worked on.
                    Even in those days he was in great shape because his family lived down the
                    street from Dean Rusk in Westchester so when he arrived he happened to be on
                    very close terms with the Secretary of State, which was nice for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tough. Tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: So at any rate, six months of struggling with Vietnamese at FSI back in the
                    basement of the Foreign Service Institute, and you emerged into the daylight in
                    '63?</p>
                <p>MARSH: In June of '63. Now one thing we haven't talked about, because it didn't
                    exist, was any area training whatsoever. Occasionally those of us in the course
                    would go over to the Department. We were supposed to have some sort of briefing
                    or training session or something of that sort. But there were very of these,
                    perhaps three or four of these and they were very unsatisfactory. We never had
                    an intensive exposition, let alone a discussion, of the U.S. desiderata, the
                    situation, the history of it all and all of that sort of thing. Never.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: What was supposed to have happened was that I was supposed to have been
                    assigned to a consulate to be established at Nha Trang, on the central coast and
                    a very nice place. Unfortunately instead of establishing that post in 1963, it
                    was established a full 10 years later, I believe. We did not have geographic
                    coverage of South Vietnam except from Saigon itself, with the exception of a
                    post at Hue which was very isolated and had very little in the way of resources.
                    It was really to be a watch post to make sure that the North Vietnamese did not
                    cross the DMZ, the demilitarized zone, which of course they did in great
                    numbers, but behind the consulate not in front of it so it was not visible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were assigned to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. In any event because I was to have had three months of additional
                    Vietnamese training at the embassy, full time. John Burke, who was later deputy
                    assistant secretary and who was ambassador in Guyana at the time of the
                    Jonestown affair, and I were the students in this class.</p>
                <p>Now there were two problems by the time we arrived in Vietnam. First of all, the
                    entire situation concerning the Ngo Dinh Diem regime had become very unsettled
                    and very, very troublesome. And the second thing was that we had a change of
                    ambassadors. I was there perhaps two weeks under Fritz Nolting, Frederick
                    Nolting, who was ambassador, and then came Henry Cabot Lodge.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Lodge wanted to rethink all sorts of things. He didn't want a vast
                    establishment. There were of course no such limits on the military, so that when
                    I arrived in Vietnam there were, I think, 17,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam.
                    This would be the rough equivalent of, say, 250,000 Vietnamese troops in the
                    United States with many times the money that U.S. people would have had. So not
                    only did we have the 17,000, a considerable number in its own right, but also
                    they were loaded. And also they were taking over housing. For example the
                    Commanding General of the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam had moved into
                    the former residence of the French commanding general - bad imagery.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>There was simply no political control. And when I say no political control I
                    mean, of course, no policy control. And when I say no policy control what I
                    really mean is that to a remarkable extent there was no policy. There was a
                    great, overarching glorious thing up in the heavens that South Vietnam shall not
                    fall to Communist North Vietnam, but apart from that there was precious little
                    guidance and precious little leadership. There was endless, endless
                    concentration upon the military effort and upon this vast work it was
                    undertaking. I am sure that to both military and civilians in Vietnam it must
                    have dwarfed all previous enterprises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vast work that was undertaken to do what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, to build the place, to rebuild the place, to train everybody from
                    university professors through district water commissioners, to build schools, to
                    build roads, to build everything you could think of, to restore the railway
                    going all over the country. And this was in the middle of an enormous war of
                    both a conventional and non-conventional nature. It was an extraordinary
                    thing.</p>
                <p>A few years later I was temporarily Consul in Hue. I'll never forget one day, it
                    was one of the most trying days of my life, when we had virtually all of the
                    students of the University of Hue out on strike. There were demonstrations and
                    all of that sort of thing, and the Buddhists themselves in virtually open revolt
                    and so forth. A great Wagnerian lady arrived from the United States to say that
                    she was a higher education advisor and she had come to do work at the University
                    of Hue. I said, “Madam, you have been sent here under misleading instructions,
                    the university has been closed for two weeks and we are not at all sure we'll be
                    able to change that.” She looked over her ample bosom at me and said, “Well,
                    open it.” And just about that time a vast flotilla of helicopters, Hueys, bound
                    for an air strike against the Vietcong and North Vietnamese passed overhead and
                    I said to myself, “This is absolutely unreal!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two or three months of language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I got my three months of language training and then was told I would be
                    assigned to the consular section in Saigon and that they had decided that was
                    what I would be doing. I said that that would provide very little opportunity to
                    use the Vietnamese and without rancor of any kind, let's just call this
                    assignment quits. I didn't struggle through a tonal language very badly taught,
                    well, decently taught but under very difficult circumstances, I mean we had a
                    coup d'etat just before we concluded the training. I didn't do that to work in
                    the consular section with visa applicants. That's not what it was about. So I
                    said to just send me home. And then my wife had had difficulty to get the proper
                    tickets. So, just send me home.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So there was a lot of discussion. The personnel officer was a friend of mine and
                    she was very helpful. Finally it was decided that I should be sort of
                    over-complement in the Political Section helping with the foreign relations of
                    South Vietnam which of course did not involve the Vietnamese army, until they
                    found me something. So after a couple of months they found me a position in what
                    was called the Provincial Reporting Unit. These were about seven officers within
                    the Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seven officers, within the Political Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, my friend, we had 25 kosher Foreign Service officers ithe Political
                    Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Kosher” means they actually worked for the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 25?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: 25.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Political Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct. Q: Holy mackerel! In 1963?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. So what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The idea of a provincial reporting officer was to go out to the
                    countryside and to cover developments out there and in effect to make a
                    viability assessment. How are things going, are we winning, all that kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you wear a flak jacket?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MARSH: No, Sir. This was the heroic period of my life because I was driving jeeps
                    over mined roads; I was in a small provincial town when the Vietcong attacked
                    the military headquarters, which is where I was. They handed me a weapon and I
                    went up on the roof. Fortunately I didn't have to use it, because I wouldn't
                    have known how, having qualified with an M-1 at ROTC training camp only because
                    there was a sergeant who was much too smart to have me in any make-up sessions.
                    So he passed me when all I could have done with the M-1 was to have thrown it at
                    somebody.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I was on the roof and saw one of the most incredible sights in my
                    life, namely a napalm attack on a Vietcong encampment, about a mile away, by our
                    helicopters at night. Incredible colors, explosions, all of that sort of thing.
                    Absolutely magnificent!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. Wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In any event, I did that work, covering first the provinces up in the
                    central Vietnam region. Later I became chief of that unit, after Jim Rosenthal,
                    later ambassador...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for you, because you were still at this
                        point...what...an FSOor 5?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, it's interesting. That's correct. It took me 25 years in the Foreign
                    Service to supervise as many people as I did in the early '60s in Vietnam. 25
                    years to supervise as many people. I had seven under me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your responsibilities were largely sort of covering
                        internadomestic developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, no...political-military and then some. The idea was how are the
                    efforts to arm and train the Vietnamese going? How are our military training
                    activities proceeding? How are our economic assistance programs functioning or
                    not? What is the mood, what is the attitude of the South Vietnamese?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are going out from the embassy frequently, touring
                        arounthe countryside?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. Usually a week out and then a week back in Saigon to write up
                    everything. You had to get the essential military clearances. A major concession
                    was that military clearances were required on our reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MARSH: That was part of the great effort of the Department of Statto get along
                    with everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this what Ambassador Lodge wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, it really was Ambassador Taylor because he believed, poor man, God
                    rest his soul, but he believed that FSOs could not understand military affairs.
                    And what Vietnam proved was that war is much too important a matter to be left
                    to military people.</p>
                <p>Q: I take your point but I had you in the embassy in Saigon with Ambassador
                    Nolting having been recently replaced with Ambassador Lodge and then Ambassador
                    Taylor replaces Ambassador Lodge?</p>
                <p>MARSH: And then Lodge returns and replaces Taylor, for a second tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was there with both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is really a significant factor in the embassy's
                        reportinthat it has to be cleared with MACV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's absolutely correct. It was a great inhibition anI'll give you what
                    I think is the classic case.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Ambassador, now ambassador Richard Teare, one of the finest officers it has ever
                    been my privilege to know, was working for me. He went to a province in the
                    Upper Delta. He came back and wrote a masterly report; very balanced, very
                    objective, very well done that pointed out how precarious the situation was.
                    MACV blew up over this report when it came time for them to clear the final
                    version because they held that adequate training and recruitment of the South
                    Vietnamese militia forces had taken place, and all that sort of thing. So Phil
                    Habib, at that time our political counselor, said, “Well, could Dick go down and
                    take another look?” I said goodbye to Dick in the morning at the embassy, I can
                    remember it very clearly, and I told him I supported him 100 percent but that
                    unfortunately we were up against some power relationships here that were
                    difficult. I wished him good luck and all the best and so forth.</p>
                <p>I returned to my work and then towards the end of the morning Dick reappeared. I
                    said, “What happened, that was a short trip.” Dick said that his flight couldn't
                    land at the province capital because the Vietcong had overrun it.</p>
                <p>Therefore, as a consequence, MACV agreed with Dick's version, right?</p>
                <p>Absolutely wrong! They would not change a word of the neutereversion that they
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the South Vietnamese Army was shortly going to
                        recaptureverything and everything would be fine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Who knows, who knows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's incredible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: So at any rate I'll skip briefly over Vietnam because in another interview
                    I'm going to be talking about it. In any event we had the misfortune to be on
                    home leave in the United States when the wives were directed to leave by
                    President Johnson, the families had to leave. We sought advice of the Department
                    of State but weren't able to obtain any; no one could give us any. We also found
                    out that my wife was expecting our first child.</p>
                <p>Well, we had around-the-world tickets to go back to Saigon, so we decided that we
                    would locate Ruth, my wife, in Bangkok. We arrived there. I'm happy to put it on
                    the record that I couldn't believe how inhospitable and how uncaring the embassy
                    in Bangkok was to the Saigon wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is an embassy in a similar part of the world with
                        versimilar conditions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MARSH: Precisely.</p>
                <p>It so happened that my wife went into labor suddenly. She had a Thai who drove
                    for her with his tiny car and she tried to reach him and she failed. Her
                    contractions were getting faster and faster. She called the embassy. It wasn't
                    just that the embassy turned her down on a ride to the hospital, it wasn't that
                    alone, it was that they gave her a lecture about Saigon wives not supposed to be
                    bothering the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't believe it!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: She managed to get a taxi and the traffic in Bangkok, as many people know,
                    is horrendous. Even 30 years ago it was horrendous, and our son was coming. As a
                    matter of fact he was starting his final descent as they arrived at the
                    hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unbelievable and this is the first child.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I would like to say to you that the man who turned her down, an American,
                    was completely exceptional, and that he was not the kind of Foreign Service
                    officer that we seek to have, but he did later become an Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't believe it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And so what I understood when I heard about that some years later was that
                    I was the exceptional one, in thinking that, as is the case in the military,
                    things had to be “look out for the troops.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q I can't believe it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But it was a bitter, very bitter and difficult experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Assistant Secretary of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Assistant Secretary of State for Administration.</p>

                <p>MARSH: At any rate we were then in 1966. I was desperate to have a sort of normal
                    diplomatic assignment because this had been such an unusual place where, of
                    course, the embassy having been blown up in the middle of my tour, you
                    understand, that it would be nice to see what a place was like under normal
                    circumstances. But of course nothing would do, I had to go back to the Vietnam
                    desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. But the normal tour, wasn't it two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was extended, without our consent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spent an extra year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct, it was extended from two years to threyears.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...in this sort of war zone? Where the military weren't
                        evespending more than two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I have served, and those of my colleagues have served, far longer in
                    Vietnam than 90% of the military ever did, and without weapons, of course.</p>
                <p>Q: We are going to end this part of the interview with your finishing your tour
                    in Saigon and now you are coming back to the Vietnam desk in the Department.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Good afternoon, this is Lambert (Nick) Heyniger and I am interviewinWilliam
                    (Bill) Marsh. Today is Monday, December 8, 1997.</p>
                <p>Bill has been talking about his service in Saigon and Hue. The story is up to
                    1966. So, Bill, you have now been in Vietnam for three years and it is 1966,
                    what happens now?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Reassignment happens now. It was a very difficult year in terms of the
                    work that I was doing during the first half of the year in Vietnam. It was a
                    very difficult transfer back to the United States. It was very, very difficult
                    taking up work on the Vietnam working group or Task Force that had been
                    established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that where you were assigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, it was a disappointment because as I may have mentioned earlier, I
                    wanted to work in a, shall we say, more normal sort of post to see what the
                    standard regular workings of the Foreign Service were like. A good friend of
                    mine, as a matter of fact a Foreign Service colleague and in fact my former
                    roommate at graduate school, some years afterward said to me rather scornfully
                    that I had never been in the Foreign Service. I had been in Vietnam, and that
                    was so extraordinary that it really didn't count as experience in the Foreign
                    Service. He may have had a point.</p>
                <p>In any event come spring of 1966, I was dispatched from Saigon to Hue because of
                    the Buddhist uprising and certain rumblings about the Vietnamese military, our
                    allies in that area, and rather they were not plotting against the government.
                    So I found myself in Hue at about the time one would be sending a lot of cables
                    to the Department asking about the next assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just before we go on, you were sort of assigned to Hue
                        TDY?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, I was TDY up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your capacity up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Consul. I was in charge of the state of the Americans there. I feared for
                    it because there seemed to be a very, very strong anti-American sentiment among
                    youth and the citizenry at Hue, particularly in those of the Buddhist
                    persuasion. So I recommended to Saigon that we close the post. Well, that
                    recommendation coming from a junior officer did not carry a great deal of weight
                    so they sent a very senior officer, Tom Corcoran, who had managed over his
                    career to serve in every post in Indochina to Hanoi, as well as the three other
                    countries. Tom came up and took a look around and said yes, I actually had a
                    point and one should close down the post, but that the Buddhists took care of
                    the matter because they burned it down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for heaven's sake. You weren't in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Fortunately, once again, I used up another of my cat lives. I've used two
                    or three by this time, haven't I? I still have a few left. But my biggest
                    problem came in trying to persuade the Department of State I was married, had
                    been for three years, and therefore was entitled to travel orders and a passport
                    for my wife, and while we were at it, for my son who had been born in 1965. Some
                    worthy in the Department told me I wasn't married and I pointed out in retort
                    that I had a son and was informed coolly that you don't have to be married to
                    have a child...which really sent me up the wall!</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>In any event, finally came orders and so forth so we decided we would have a
                    little break together, our six month old son, my wife and me, and we sailed from
                    Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they think, for example, Bill, that you had
                        established relationship with a Vietnamese lady?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, if so, she was the only Vietnamese lady ever to have been born in
                    Ponca City, Oklahoma. I don't know what they thought, but you are making an
                    assumption, Nick, that they thought! I wouldn't necessarily go along with
                    that.</p>
                <p>At any rate, just to lighten matters a bit, we sailed on the President Cleveland
                    from Hong Kong. You know we had shore leave in Yokohama so we went up to Tokyo
                    and had a good time with our baby, and so forth. A classmate of mine from
                    undergraduate days was General Manager of the Imperial Hotel, so we were going
                    to take a taxi back down to the ship and he put a hotel car at our disposal,
                    with a driver. Very thoughtful, except that the driver was a country bumpkin who
                    knew nothing of Tokyo and got caught in immense traffic jam. So as we arrived at
                    the pier in Yokohama we saw the President Cleveland sailing off.</p>
                <p>Not to worry, they said, and they sent a lighter and we got into the lighter and
                    it took us out into the harbor where the Cleveland dropped her pilot. A huge
                    rope ladder was put down the side of this 25,000-ton ship. I put baby inside my
                    suit coat jacket, tucked him in there, and up we went. And a great pair of hairy
                    arms came out, that's all we could see were the hairy arms out of the side of
                    the ship, and we heard “Give me the baby” so we did and then we continued on up
                    to a deck where we could get up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My god! On a rope ladder up the side of this steamer, with
                        youwife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: With my wife, and with the baby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have been terrified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: This was climbing up about seven stories, I would guess. Well, while this
                    was underway we were more or less stationary, fortunately they stop when they
                    drop the pilot, and they don't just toss him overboard.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>At any event we arrived in Washington and hit a maelstrom. The problem
                    essentially was the difficulty in obtaining policy orders, the confusion. The
                    fact that there was tremendous concentration in the presidency of
                    decision-making on Vietnam. You'll recall that President Johnson even had a
                    great hand in designing and approved the embassy that was built after the
                    closure of the old one in 1965. That's how closely everything was worked
                    out.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me just take a second here. Okay, now, the Secretary of State is Dean
                    Rusk, the assistant secretary for the Far Eastern Bureau is Bill Bundy, and the
                    deputy assistant secretary is...</p>
                <p>MARSH: Len Unger, ambassador previously in Laos and later in Thailand. The office
                    director is Bob Miller, who is later ambassador to Malaysia and to C�te
                    d'Ivoire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're working on the Vietnam desk? What were sort
                        ogenerally your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was one of the two political officers. You'll recall that at that time
                    McNamara said that he was spending 90 percent of his time as Secretary of
                    Defense on Vietnam. Yet President Johnson, in his memos later, said that his
                    time was perhaps two-thirds, 70 percent devoted to Vietnam at that time. And
                    there we are and the Department of State has named two thirtyish political
                    officers to cover this enormous problem.</p>
                <p>Now there were others who were there on special details. At one time, for
                    example, there was a Peace Corps officer, though the Peace Corps never had any
                    representatives in Vietnam. But it was come one, come all, everybody get in the
                    act. At the same time, the essential political work was done either by the two
                    political officers, John Helble and I, or some of the extra people assigned to
                    deal particularly with North Vietnam affairs or with negotiations or what not
                    and so forth. But the regular kind of deskwork that was done was performed by
                    John Helble and by me.</p>
                <p>So we arrived and the Buddhist uprising in Central Vietnam had become quite
                    serious indeed. Thus John and I are told that what we need to do is to ensure
                    continuous monitoring and coverage. Therefore we should take turns during the
                    night, in night duty up in the Operations Center. What this meant was that we
                    tended to work 36 hours on and 12 off. We did this for four months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Holy mackerel!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You know, if you want an introduction to exhaustion, this ia very good way
                    to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How come 36 hours on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I think in looking back now the extraordinary thing is we didn't
                    post any objection. We were so deferential and all of us at that time had been
                    in the military, albeit for brief periods of time, not during the Korean War,
                    necessarily, probably not as a matter of fact. But we had had military service
                    to perform after graduating from college and so orders were orders, and “Yes,
                    Sir.” We should have said, and I think today's generation would say, to get some
                    more people in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it meant both of you worked all day and then one person
                        workeall night.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct and this was on a seven day a week basis, anthis was for
                    four months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before I interrupted you, you said that it was sort of a
                        policmaelstrom with lots of different people telling you what they
                        wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, it was that. It was pandemonium, really. There were some really
                    quite extraordinary things. For example, in the previous year, that is to say
                    about fifteen months earlier, February of 1965, while on home leave I had been
                    brought into a special little crisis group. This was at the time of the
                    beginning of the air strikes occasioned by the Vietcong actions against U.S.
                    military advisors in South Vietnam. I remember distinctly that one of the things
                    that was made a cardinal principle of it all and I believe originated in State
                    was that in no way were public statements or diplomatic initiatives to indicate
                    that these strikes were retaliatory.</p>
                <p>Well, this was just contrary to common sense. I protested feebly about this,
                    trying to say not only that this action of attempting to cast something in a
                    distorted way was against nature, it was actually unhelpful. If we didn't point
                    out that this was retaliation, we couldn't get the advantage in part, at least
                    among the South Vietnamese, for the undertaking in the first place. I lost and
                    was regarded as something of an upstart, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>This was the period, between 1966 and '68, when I'm afraid I got into trouble
                    several times. For example, there was a Lieutenant Colonel who made a very
                    unfortunate statement in Vietnam in 1968. He said, with respect at the time of
                    the Tet offensive, to the retaking of the town of Ben Thuy, a town in the Delta,
                    that it was quote “ necessary to destroy it in order to save it” unquote. I
                    suggested a strong public relations campaign to disown this statement, to
                    dissociate us from it as much as possible.</p>
                <p>People thought that this was extreme.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I warned that this was going to become a byword for this effort and that we
                    should get away from it. Others said absolutely not. I think time has shown who
                    maybe had the right diagnosis on that matter. But I got into a little trouble
                    over that one, as a matter of fact. Later still, for example, I said that in
                    1968 again I had detected a lot of popular upheaval about the war and its
                    course, even after President Johnson had indicated that he would not run
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking now about popular upheaval in the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, that is right. And others on the staff said no, that the President's
                    self-sacrificial act, if you will, had completely appeased public opinion. I
                    wrote a memo contesting this and saying in particular that I understood from
                    talking to people throughout the country that there was going to be a particular
                    problem at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Others did not find
                    that and so I became considered something of a Cassandra, and something of an
                    alarmist. I paid for that. You'll recall that there were parts of our
                    effectiveness reports in those days that were not shown to us? Later I found
                    that there had been some comment put in about that. It was a very trying time
                    for me because it really was something that tried one's soul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take a bit more time. In other words, the Office
                        Director is writing your Efficiency Report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, never mind who that is, but in any event...this was before any
                    dissent channel. These didn't exist then. I didn't know this. This was the back
                    part of the report, which wasn't shown to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not supposed to be part of the game.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The part that was shown to me glowed. The part that wasn't shown to me
                    burned, like acid, a little bit, a little bit. But at any rate, it was a very
                    difficult time because first of all, to mix metaphors, it took the Titanic years
                    to sink, but we knew she was going down, those of us who were paying any
                    attention. We knew that our effort was not prevailing and moreover we were
                    seeing the destruction of the consensus, the domestic consensus in the United
                    States on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me ask were you briefing people on a fairly regular basis? For example,
                    did you go up and brief Ambassador Unger and Assistant Secretary Bundy and other
                    people on day to day developments in Vietnam?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MARSH: Yes in some ways and some times. It depended. After all they had other
                    sources. But they wanted to hear from the field directly which is one of the
                    reasons that for four months we were supposed to call embassy Saigon every few
                    hours throughout the night and then do a memorandum to the Secretary on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did a daily briefing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I briefed all sorts of people, that was my department. For example, I went
                    over and briefed Senator Robert Kennedy once a month. The reason was that we had
                    a classmate who worked for Kennedy, as you will recall, and he got me in and so
                    forth. I briefed one time the governor of Oklahoma. I was visiting my wife's
                    parents and I had a breakfast arrangement with the governor of Oklahoma, later
                    Senator Henry Bellman, who drove 130 miles from the state capitol to have
                    breakfast with me in Ponca City at 6 o'clock in the morning to hear firsthand
                    about Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me probe with you a little more on that and let me ask you, as you
                    discussed the Vietnam situation and briefed some of these senior officers, what
                    was their reaction? Were there sort of different reactions and different sort of
                    feeling they had about the situation and the future?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That's a good question. It seems to me that we briefed them about tactical
                    situations and I think that was really beside the point, I think the essential
                    point was what was the end game going to be? On that none of us had any idea
                    what it was because there was a general supposition, from the President on down,
                    perhaps arising from our western logical point of view that ultimately the (end

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, can you tell us a little bit. It's important to know
                        one's background and one's interests and one's personal setting. Where were
                        you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In Pennsylvania, in Scranton, as a matter of fact, in thdepths of the
                    Depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was 1931 and given the unemployment and the depression that afflicted
                    that area, and still to some extent does, you can see that it would have
                    influences on my attitudes about obtaining and holding a job, that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, never. We moved away and I went to school mainly in Detroit, Michigan,
                    where we lived until I went off to college. Then apart from returning to Detroit
                    for summer employment, twice, I didn't go back again at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were a student in Detroit what were your
                        personainterests at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: My personal interests in Detroit were largely shaped by my family. I was
                    an only child from a very devout, quite strict family and they saw life in terms
                    of a triad: family, school, church and that was about it. And so those were my
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about college, higher education, where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I went to Cornell University simply because I met a trustee and it was one
                    of the great serendipities of my life because the Department of Government there
                    was superb. I switched from pre law to government in order to benefit from the
                    presence of Clinton Rossiter and Robert Cushman and Herbert Briggs and Mario
                    Einaudi and many others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. Was that generally government across the
                        board owith a focus on international affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Particularly international affairs related.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask when did you get interested in international
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MARSH: It was there. But you will recall that Detroit, although inland, has an
                    exposure because a foreign country is a mile away. It is not a very foreign
                    country, but it is a country of course that was at war two and a half years
                    before we were and where a youngster could go over and learn something about the
                    war and the different peoples and that sort of thing. But I think what really
                    interested me and piqued and excited my interest was when I did my Air Force
                    ROTC duty as a second, later a first lieutenant in Japan for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that before Cornell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, it was part of their ROTC Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was after you had studied government and graduated
                        froCornell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were with the Air Force ROTC in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In Japan in an unbelievable job, aide-de-camp to the commanding general of
                    the Far East Air Forces. So that meant traveling around everything between
                    Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Commanding General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: There were several of them but the last one was General Earl Partridge,
                    whose serial number was 33-A, that will tell you are how long his pedigree was
                    in the Air Force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the Air Force. Did you fly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, no. These eyes were not capable of that. But in those days
                    Cornell, which is partly a land grant institution, was obliged to offer ROTC and
                    they made that mandatory for us. Later a student, about 1968 challenged it, I
                    think, who said they had to offer it but could not make students take it. And
                    that was the end of known ROTC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you glad you did ROTC?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MARSH: On June 25th, 1950, I was extremely glad that I did ROTC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Korean War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct, because we expected to be drafted out of college. I was at
                    that time a first term sophomore. I had just completed my first term sophomore
                    year. I entered in mid year and graduated in mid year, another complication in
                    an endlessly complicated life. But just the same it was very good because in
                    those days, in the early '50s, all of us went into the military. The question
                    was not whether we would go into the military but whether we would go as
                    officers or enlisted men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Universal? MARSH: It was virtually universal.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any more on Japan? That was two years in Japan as a young
                        man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was two years in Japan and there was a problem that I was chosen to
                    address because I was the sole French speaker in the Headquarters, and that was
                    passports and visas for U.S. airmen who would be assisting the French in
                    Indochina.</p>
                <p>We had an extremely complicated arrangement obliged by the French at that time
                    whereby passports of U.S. airmen would go to Saigon. There they would be visa'd
                    by the so-called Associated States of Indochina and then would go to Paris where
                    they would be checked out by the French and then returned to Tokyo. This
                    procedure took a month. I'm talking about just before and during Dien Bien
                    Phu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was 1954?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: 1953-54, and I went over, Senior Second Lieutenant that I was, and dealt
                    with Ambassador L�vy, the French ambassador in Tokyo. He was a marvelous man. I
                    think he was amused by this presumptuous youngster who came, but who did speak
                    the French language, and we worked out a shortcut on this, which reduced it to
                    about a week.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I learned French in high school, four years was obligatory.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In public high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other languages at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: At that time, no, not living languages, but Latin as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had French and Latin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your French from high school served you in good stead
                        workinin Japan for the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And throughout my career. Yes, as a matter of fact. I hataken additional
                    French in college, so I had advanced French in college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this experience in Japan working with the Vietnam
                        connectiosomething that got you interested in diplomatic work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Very much so because Ambassador John Allison somehow got my name from
                    somewhere and I was invited to dinner at several stag dinners that he gave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Ambassador Allison?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: U.S. ambassador to Japan at that time, later ambassador to Indonesia. I
                    remember, for example, a dinner for Senator Earl Clements and Ambassador Allison
                    invited me. There were about twelve people present and I think the next person
                    in age to me was about 20 years older at that time. Perhaps I was the “brat” you
                    show off, or something of that sort. But in any event I came to know Mrs.
                    Allison as well, and they were very kind, very thoughtful, and they counseled me
                    about a Foreign Service career. To them there was nothing better, nothing
                    finer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after the Air Force and Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MARSH: Returned to the States and went to the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton
                    and was there two years. I took my Masters in Public and International
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those two years at Princeton what was the most
                        important thinthat you gained?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I think it became clearer to me what a pluralistic process government
                    really is and how many interests, viewpoints, constituencies are a part of any
                    action or any decision. Particularly in the American context where we have
                    probably the most complicated form of government in the world and that in a
                    sense American Government is a Pirandello play. The difficulty is to draw policy
                    and effective performance out of all of that. That is the challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Profitable two years? Grad school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Extremely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, and the reason is the Foreign Service likes to send people itself
                    to graduate school and then say the training division people can chalk up
                    another one, that sort of thing. I think that a Doctorate in particular is of
                    relatively little official use. But graduate study is more than just officially
                    beneficial, for personal reasons one should get as much as one can, obviously. I
                    draw a distinction between those two options.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What then? How old were you at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was 26 when I graduated from Princeton. Then I did something that was
                    very strange, and very quaint in today's terms. Since each of us has two
                    children we would be stunned if this sort of thing were to happen. But at any
                    rate, I listened to my family who suggested strongly that I go and work for a
                    Foundation in Pittsburgh presided over by a cousin of my mother's and connected
                    with industry, but whose focus was on state and local government. And so I went
                    out there and did a number of studies and became an ex officio member of the
                    Pittsburgh school board and worked on industrial and economic development for
                    Pennsylvania and all of that sort of thing. I did some other things, really very
                    small little studies on landfills, for example, which are some of the most
                    politically controversial things you can possibly do. A landfill operator
                    threatened suit because I had said in an address one time that landfills were
                    not terribly popular with residents of a community.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did the experience last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: One year longer than I had planned because I had an ulterior motive to go
                    out there, stay a couple of years and then go into the Foreign Service. My
                    planning became disrupted when the Foreign Service did not offer the examination
                    in 1958. So my plan to enter the Foreign Service in 1959 was thrown off a year.
                    Mind, I had already taken the Foreign Service examination, the written, and
                    passed it. But they wouldn't hold the scores or give me time off so I had to
                    take it again and I passed it again and then took the orals in the spring of
                    1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, when did you decide you were going to make the
                        ForeigService your choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Perhaps when, intellectually, I found the work and the subject matter so
                    fascinating and personally, probably when I discovered how much I enjoyed living
                    abroad. I really was delighted living in Japan, fascinated by all the cultural
                    differences. I took Japanese at the embassy. In those days I was not bad in
                    spoken Japanese, but I never took the written.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever follow up on that Japanese later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Events precluded it. It's interesting that Mrs. Jorden wathe head of the
                    teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara Jorden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, no, Eleanor Jorden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Eleanor Jorden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Eleanor Jorden was head of the program in the embassy in Tokyo and one of
                    the most brilliant teachers I have ever encountered. She was an extraordinary,
                    an inspiring person. And she later became, you are familiar with her, Vlad, she
                    became head of Far Eastern languages at FSI.</p>
                <p>Q: Right. Bill, when you were taking the Foreign Service exams, was that one of
                    several options that you were going to do? To try it out or were you pretty
                    firmly wishing to go in that direction?</p>
                <p>MARSH: When I make up my mind, Vladimir, it is a one way street. I'm an
                    opinionated person, frankly, and I've never been without a course of action. I
                    don't flounder. So that was it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And as I say, as a dutiful son, I did something else fothree years. But
                    that proved beneficial in its own right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you enter the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I came in the end of November 1960, that is to say the week after
                    Thanksgiving and about four weeks after the election of John F. Kennedy. So
                    Eisenhower signed my commission, January 5, 1961, only two weeks before he left
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably have one signed by Kennedy a little bit
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I do, in terms of promotions, but for promotions, not thoriginal
                    appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened in November 1960? You came to Washington
                        anwhat did you do at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, there was a certain amount of confusion. At the time of the orals
                    the previous spring they had sai- remember we had eight grades then in Foreign
                    Service - and they had said that since I had a Masters Degree, work experience
                    and military experience I would certainly come in as a seven, but probably as a
                    six. I was looking forward to that. I was appointed as an eight, at the top of
                    the eight, so the first thing that I did was to take a one-third pay cut
                    compared with what I was receiving at the Foundation in Pittsburgh. I came into
                    the expensive environment of Washington, high rent, high this, high that, and I
                    found myself impoverished, as a matter of fact. Quite impoverished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, do you remember what you were being paid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. I was paid $6,165 a year. You'll recall that I told you it was
                    January 5th when President Eisenhower signed my commission, well that was five
                    days too late to get a step-increase in 1962, so I didn't get one until 1963,
                    that is to say nineteen months after I had come into the Foreign Service. That
                    was for a princely $180 a year, the standard three percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. So you didn't join it for the money?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MARSH: Clearly not, clearly not. And I'd like to say, Vlad, that when I retired
                    in 1996, as a minister counselor, that in real terms, in 1996 dollars, I was
                    making twice what I was making in 1960 at the Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. Let me ask how did you spend your first
                        period otime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, A-100 was remarkably short. I couldn't believe that wwould go in
                    with a four-week introductory course, particularly since....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Four weeks? Was that sufficient? Was that too little?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Much, much too little. Plus there was a certain amount of indecision. I
                    had said that I would like to have a Washington assignment in order to learn the
                    ways of the Department. I was told it was out of the question, that since I was
                    29 I had to go overseas to a small post where I would get to do everything, see
                    everything, and I would know the post operation. That was fine. Then, of course,
                    when the assignments officer came and read off the assignments, and I was
                    assigned to Washington, I was disappointed!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your expectations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. I was really the company man par excellence, but I was
                    disappointed, terribly disappointed, when I had got what I had sought in the
                    first place!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a bachelor at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was a bachelor at that time. My first assignment was in the Aviation
                    Division and something very interesting happened there. My first day, after I
                    would say, perhaps, 15 or 20 minutes of orientation, I was handed a folder and
                    told, “Here. Revise the proposed Air Transport Agreement with Brazil.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Now this has happened many times later. It's a scenario where Dad walks
                    you to the end of the pier and then gives you a swift kick into the lake and
                    says, “Okay, now swim.” That seems to be the Department's version of training in
                    many instances.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this done as a way to make you jump in and get
                        orienteprofessionally or was it just mismanagement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I'll never know, I'll never know, probably both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the predecessor of today's civil aviation work in
                        thState Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was civil aviation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I started in January of 1961 and it was to have been a two-year tour, and
                    then I received orders to Santiago, Chile, which I found curious because I had
                    no particular interest, zero experience, and no language capabilities for
                    Santiago, Chile. But I was supposed to go down there and do something. I've
                    forgotten what.</p>
                <p>Instead in the early fall of 1962, I was called to a meeting in the Department.
                    Perhaps you were there, too, Vlad, I don't know. But in any event there were, I
                    would say, sixty officers of my age and of my inexperience. We were told that we
                    had been summoned because we were French speakers and bachelors. And I remember
                    Jim Bishop, who later became a deputy assistant secretary, an ambassador to
                    several places in Africa, say, “Wait a minute. I've got a wife and a kid on the
                    way.” And so then others of us spoke up and said, “I'm married, what do you mean
                    bachelor?” And I was among those who said that, because I had been married in
                    May of 1962. So there was a certain amount of consternation. They said, “Well,
                    we are considering a special program for Vietnam and the married men can be
                    excused from that because we really would prefer bachelors.”</p>
                <p>Well, I had no idea what a profound decision I was making when didn't make a
                    decision to sidestep the Vietnam program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in other words at that time you could have said, “I'm
                        married man” and you would not have gone to Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct. That is correct. But I talked with some people and they
                    said that Vietnam was a growth industry, that I ought to get with that program,
                    that it was fascinating. It was a chance to speak French and, then, it was
                    something else. It was not Santiago, Chile, which I'm sure is a delightful spot,
                    but didn't interest me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, in the fall of 1962, what was your image of
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Let me preface it by saying that I had visited Vietnam with my General,
                    briefly, very briefly, in 1955. Well, even earlier. I had been put on orders
                    while in Tokyo in late 1953 that would have made me, now get this, as an Air
                    Force Second Lieutenant, would have made me port liaison officer in
                    Haiphong.</p>
                <p>What was going on? Well, there was to be a major mobilization for service in
                    North Vietnam to assist the French who were in the final days of their agony
                    there, but President Eisenhower vetoed the whole idea. You will recall that
                    Admiral Radford, Vice President Nixon and many others, urged and advocated this,
                    but the President was insistent that we should not become engaged in a land
                    war.</p>
                <p>So, it was almost in a way as if I was fated to go there. Now I visited Saigon
                    briefly with my General in 1955, never dreaming that I would be showing up there
                    eight years later. The French were still very much in command and there were
                    some obvious signs that the French had completely alienated the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the Bao Dai government at that time? Or already
                        Diem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It's Bao Dai, who had his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who had Ngo Dinh Diem as his Prime Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. But the French were still in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay in 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, just a couple of days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was horrified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, some things are not suitable for tender ears but that we were shown
                    by the French, such as the prison and certain other things that were very
                    depressing and very wrong. By the way I had met a number of French military up
                    in Tokyo when they came to visit my boss. I liked them very much. I'm a great
                    Francophile, and I liked these people very much. But when they started to talk
                    about the war and about the civilizing mission of France and all that sort of
                    thing, it was clear that they were ninety years out of date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that what you felt was wrong, basically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That and the sheer brutality with which the French hatreated much of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about any impressions about the countryside or the
                        people iVietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Even in those days the countryside, and, again, we were in the South, we
                    were in present day Cochin, China, the extreme south. There were obvious signs
                    of warfare all over the place. I can remember the railroad, following the
                    railroad, down into Saigon. We were coming from the Philippines. I don't know,
                    perhaps for a photo mission we followed the railroad. It had been blasted to
                    pieces in so many parts. You know the Trans Indochina railway had been one of
                    the French great claims of accomplishment in that area. It took them about forty
                    years to build it and they bragged constantly about it and here it was, wrecked.
                    While I didn't see North Vietnam, one wondered what the situation could have
                    been like up there where there had been even more intensive fighting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Bill, you are back in the fall of 1962 and you decide

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: To put a fine point on it, Vlad, we did not oppose a decision by the
                    Department that that should be the case. So in January I began the study of
                    Vietnamese with your good self.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Briefly speaking. In January of 1963, how was it to

                <p>MARSH: Of course, I would be delighted to get your views on this subject, but
                    mine are these. First of all, I come from a musical family and the simplest way
                    to teach tones would have been to note them musically, so I did that. I went to
                    our so-called supervisors there and said, “You know, anybody who can read music,
                    look, I've marked this on the scale for you.” They laughed me to derision. This
                    just wasn't the way it was done. Later I helped other people by telling them,
                    “Oh, well, that's a perfect fourth interval” and that sort of thing. In any
                    event the instructors and the so-called linguists at the program conducted a
                    very, very limited sort of instructional curriculum.</p>
                <p>Whereas in Japan there had been regular appearances by Mrs. Jorden, who had told
                    us something of Japanese grammar and syntax and usage and the like. And how
                    these things related to the culture and why therefore there are the three
                    politeness levels in Japanese and that sort of thing, we never had that kind of
                    briefing which in Japan I had found exceedingly useful. But we never had that
                    sort of thing. The linguists instead would concentrate on teaching us how to
                    form certain sounds. This was not very comprehensible, the way they were doing
                    that.</p>
                <p>I remember one linguist was trying to explain one particular “o” sound by asking
                    if anybody had ever been to Oklahoma. Since I was married to a native of
                    Oklahoma I could make that sound. He said, “That is very good, will everybody
                    else imitate that?” Well, you know you put intelligent people in a room and try
                    to make parrots out of them. This is not exactly the best way.</p>
                <p>Secondly, as far as substantive preparation for an assignment in Vietnam, I don't
                    know. We were supposed to read the newspaper, I think, and we were supposed to
                    intuit the rest. But there was no well-prepared program of briefings or
                    something of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to get to that. Let me just ask, when you
                        finished thcourse were you able to speak any Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Sort of. In the first place in an extremely irregular language I found
                    regional variations very pronounced and very strong. I would say I used French
                    as much or more than I used Vietnamese when I was there. Incidentally, you'll
                    recall you were supposed to have, well, my partner, John Burke, and I were
                    supposed to have three months in Saigon following the six months we had in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>The tones were never a problem for me. Vocabulary was a problem because
                    vocabulary varied from place to place and I'll never forget that sometimes
                    people in Vietnam, when I spoke with them, would light up with joy and other
                    times would look completely foggy, like what is this strange person from the
                    United States trying to say? So it was a very irregular sort of thing.</p>
                <p>I think the program probably should have been at least one year long.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One year long. A long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And I would have divided it fifty-fifty between Washington and Saigon.
                    Moreover I would have privatized the program and that would have been complete
                    submergence somewhere. Now you and I both met those who had been to the brief
                    program offered at Monterey by the Army. That was ludicrous, that program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a listening program, for listening to pilots
                        basically,I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bill, let me skip to something you touched on and that is the substantive
                    preparation for some area studies and briefings. Let me just ask generally,
                    before you left what had you learned about Vietnam, what were your impressions
                    of it, and whom had you met who was active on the Vietnam scene in Washington at
                    that time?</p>
                <p>MARSH: First of all it's necessary to plan. There was a great deaof turmoil about
                    Vietnam policy at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're speaking here about 1962, 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Early '63. Now when I say early '63, I am deliberately marking off the
                    territory before the great Buddhist uprising against Ngo Diem which began in the
                    spring of 1963. There were those at the desk, Paul Kattenburg foremost among
                    them, who took some forthright exception to the emergent Vietnam policy of the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>I learned more about that controversy far later than I did at the time, because
                    at the time there was really no discussion of pros and cons, assets and
                    liabilities, for those of us. We all had Top Secret security clearances, but
                    nobody was saying these are the risks, these are the vulnerabilities, and these
                    are the potential gains and so forth. There was never that sort of thing.
                    Instead much of it was couched in European terms and particularly the Secretary
                    of State brought up Munich 1938 time and time and time again.</p>
                <p>Q: This was Dean Rusk?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Dean Rusk. And our actions in Indochina became derivative of the global
                    strategic effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Cold War effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MARSH: That's so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody bring up Korea in that context?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Korea was not a very popular subject, as a matter of fact, because Korea,
                    of course, had ended inconclusively. Nobody wanted to make that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had begun in ambiguity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The ambiguity and the pain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not our defense perimeter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And the pain of it. Because those who served, the best man in my wedding,
                    for example, had been a Marine on the retreat from the Reservoir and he had lots
                    of things to say about the terrible suffering in that winter weather of 1950. So
                    this was not some glorious expedition, which you would use. Instead what you
                    would point to, you would point to such things as the restoration of the Shah in
                    1953, and the overthrow of Arbenz in 1954, that sort of thing. Where the United
                    States acted decisively in the interior of a country, in internal affairs, as it
                    were.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, did you have a clear, summarized policy sense of what America was doing
                    in Vietnam as you were about to go over there and work on that program?</p>
                <p>MARSH: There was a slogan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the slogan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The slogan was couched negatively. And the slogan was that we were to
                    assist the South Vietnamese to prevent their takeover by the Communist North
                    Vietnamese. So a preventive strategy, a defensive strategy, a limited
                    strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Diem had been in office since 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, as President since '56.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Q: As President since '56. What was the policy at that time? When you were going
                    over there did we have a sink or swim with Ngo Dinh Diem policy?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Of course that policy emerged much later, once considerable differences of
                    opinion had arisen. But President Truman began the policy of support for the
                    French at the time of the Korean War, in 1950. There had been a continuous
                    policy of provision of materiel and training and political support since 1950.
                    First for the French and then, of course, Geneva came along in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were getting ready in early 1963, was
                        there stila sink or swim with Ngo Dinh Diem policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Clearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clearly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You'll recall that Vice President Johnson had made a trip to the Far East
                    and had hailed Ngo Diem as the Winston Churchill of Asia. Moreover we had been
                    providing rather considerable support since 1961, fairly early in the Kennedy
                    Administration, that is. Then, 1961, which was a year of setbacks, what with the
                    Berlin Wall and what with the Bay of Pigs, all sorts of things. The Laos
                    situation turning so sour. The focus got narrower and narrower and narrower in
                    Asia until it centered on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It centered on Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bill, when did you go there?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I arrived in July of 1963. My welcoming committee at thairport consisted
                    of Dick Holbrooke and Tony Lake!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting, what were those folks doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They were....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they friends of yours from language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: From language training, that's correct.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they just came out to meet you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They came out to meet me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or were they your official greeters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They came out to meet Ruth, my wife, and me. They took us to a house. It
                    was very dark and there was a curfew because of the Buddhist uprising. The main
                    pagoda was four blocks away and it was surrounded by troops and we had an icebox
                    that was stocked with a bottle of milk, a bottle of gin, and some beer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what they had stocked for you and Ruth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, the embassy had done that, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that a rather innovative and
                    considerate way to greet a newly arriving couple, some milk, some gin...</p>
                <p>MARSH: I supposed so. Incidentally, something that was consistenthroughout my
                    three years in Vietnam, I didn't have a phone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have a phone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Never had a phone in Vietnam at my residence, no, never had residential
                    phone.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me just back up for a moment. You said that you were met at the airport by
                    Richard Holbrooke and Anthony Lake, who continue to be very interested in
                    government and one of whom was a national security advisor, another one of whom
                    has done all sorts of things with both diplomacy and business. What were those
                    fellows doing at that time?</p>
                <p>MARSH: They were on their first tours, really, and they were doing rotational
                    assignments, as I recall. Each of them later on became a sort of aide-de-camp to
                    ambassadors and that sort of thing and at the same time traveled around the
                    country. Incidentally, before we get to Vietnam there are a couple of things to
                    signal.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>First of all, I was told back in the Department that I was to be consul in Nha
                    Trang on the central coast. That did not come to pass, and then when I was given
                    passport and tickets there was nothing provided for my wife, no orders. The
                    reason was that I wasn't married, they maintained. And here we go again, this
                    error. Something happened to the Dependency Statements filed in 1962, they never
                    made it. This problem lasted for a decade, trying to get tickets and
                    passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, in other words, for a decade after you had gotten
                        marrieyou kept having to prove that you were married to get travel
                        orders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct. One time when I protested that while my wife was in
                    safehaven in Bangkok she had had our first son and how could they say I wasn't
                    married and a supernumerary at the Department told me by phone, “Sir, it isn't
                    necessary to be married to have a child.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is a wonderful story. I'm glad you took us
                        bacthere. You just took us to before you had arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Before I had arrived. That's right. But I managed to get there somehow or
                    other, maybe just to shut me up they gave me a passport and orders. However when
                    it came time to leave Asia, there were no orders or passport or tickets for my
                    wife, we had to go through that argument all over again.</p>
                <p>In any event we arrived in Saigon and there was considerable turmoil, a very
                    unsettled situation for several reasons. First the local political situation
                    with the Buddhists in open revolt and full repression practiced by the Diem
                    government, and secondly because we had a change of ambassadors and clearly a
                    change in policy.</p>
                <p>Q: We've arrived in Saigon, it is July of 1963, and you were just saying that
                    there were two things going on which added to the confusion. One was a situation
                    involving Buddhists and another was a change in American ambassadors. Could you
                    share a little bit of the Buddhist situation first of all at that time, as
                    background?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MARSH: The Buddhist situation had been simmering for quite some time but really
                    boiled over in Hue in May, I think it was, of 1963. Now Hue had special
                    resonance because Central Vietnam was the homeland of President Ngo Dinh Diem,
                    and Hue was the see of his brother, the Archbishop, Archbishop Thuc. There was a
                    repression, and it was a bloody repression, of some Buddhist demonstrations and
                    yet another brother of President Diem, Ngo Dinh Nhu, and particularly the
                    latter's wife, Tranh Le Xuan, were hard-liners. We subsequently learned that Ngo
                    Dinh Nhu was double-dealing. But at that time not many of us knew it, if any of
                    us knew that, as a matter of fact because Ngo was extending his lines to the
                    North Vietnamese by the Vietcong, the Vietnamese communists.</p>
                <p>So international attention focused on this when there were several immolations by
                    Buddhist bonzes, or priests. The press drawn to Vietnam by the increasing
                    American involvement in the affairs of that country had something sensational to
                    photograph and to report upon that could be very meaningful to the American
                    public as a whole. After all, that you arm so many hamlets or that you prepare
                    the defenses of so many provinces is pretty tame stuff, but martyrs were
                    something quite different. So that was the Buddhist situation.</p>
                <p>Now, when we arrived in July of 1963, Ambassador Nolting was already preparing
                    his departure, in fact did so in mid July, and Ambassador Lodge had been named
                    to the post. For the younger listeners, readers, we should point out that Lodge
                    was, after all, the Vice Presidential candidate opposite Lyndon B. Johnson's
                    vice presidential candidacy only three years previously. So this was quite
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a bi-partisan gesture. MARSH: It was a
                        bi-partisan gesture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By a president who hated Mr. Lodge, I suspect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: By a President who had seen in Mr. Lodge everything the President's father
                    had had to contend with over many years in the Boston area. So that it was a
                    case of opposites attracting. Yes, indeed, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Bill, had you had a chance to work with Ambassador
                        Nolting aall before he left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I met him. He was a very approachable man, but again I was in there in the
                    capacity of a student, studying in Vietnamese. But a member of my FSO entering
                    class had been his staff aide and so he took me in to meet the ambassador and we
                    talked and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Now there was a policy shift that was imminent. Ambassador Nolting had been
                    identified, rightly or wrongly, probably erroneously, as with Ngo Dinh Diem,
                    sink or swim, up or down. So it was clear that a tougher line was coming in with
                    Ambassador Lodge. Why else would the President name the man he had unseated 11
                    years previously in order to get to the Senate? Why would he invite him if we
                    were going to continue with the same old thing? From the arrival of Ambassador
                    Lodge in August of 1963 until the coup d'etat of November 1, 1963, there was
                    great speculation as to what the Lodge appointment meant and what this mean in
                    particular for President Diem.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we get into this period, let me ask a little about the American embassy
                    at that time. When you arrived you went and met a lot of people, can you
                    describe what that embassy was, who was there, who was who at that time?</p>
                <p>Who was the deputy chief of mission?</p>
                <p>MARSH: The deputy chief of mission was Bill Truehart at that time. Mel Manfull
                    was the political counselor. Richardson was the station chief, CIA, and was a
                    particular target of Madam Nhu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Richardson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I think so, yes, I believe so. But that wasn't, franklVlad, that wasn't
                    what caught my attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caught your attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Now the thing I want to describe for you it is necessary to hark back ten
                    years previously when I saw a very large military presence in Japan. I saw bases
                    with tens of thousands of people on them and so forth. But I never saw so many
                    U.S. military relative to the civilian population as in Saigon. They seemed to
                    be everywhere and the Vietnamese, except at rush hours, seemed to be off the
                    street but there were hordes it appeared of military there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in mid 1963?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's so, and there were at that time about 18,000 American military in
                    the country. Now 18,000 would be the equivalent of about 250,000 Vietnamese in
                    the United States, something like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Concentrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Very largely concentrated. They were building an enormouheadquarters staff
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that? Was that the MAAG, the Military Assistance
                        Group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The MACV, the Military Assistance Command-Vietnam. That'right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the second of the two? First there was a MAAG,
                        thathere was a MACV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is so. And they were already planning a MACV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they couldn't stand each other, as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: There were problems but very soon the MAAG was incorporated into the MACV
                    which became a full military Command, it just had hordes of people. For example,
                    where I worked for two and a half years was the Provincial Reporting Unit. There
                    were seven of us provincial reporters and the military set up a unit just to
                    process our reports, nothing else, with 58 people in it.</p>
                <p>Q: I was in that unit with you, Bill, and I never knew that until today! You're
                    saying that the military set up a unit to process the reports produced by
                    provincial reporting?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had a total of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Seven.</p>
                <p>Q: A total of seven persons. Amazing. Well, it certainly is attentive. Bill, you
                    were impressed with the military presence at that time in Saigon?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I was worried by it. Q: You were worried by it.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MARSH: I was worried by it, to be perfectly frank with you. Let me again just
                    recall something for the user's benefit here. I had been in local government
                    work, albeit with a Foundation, but there was of necessity a heavy local
                    political component of that work. So I had picked up certain sensitivities of
                    which I really wasn't even fully aware. But what I want to say is, and many
                    people have asked me, when did I first have a suspicion that things were not
                    necessarily going to go according to plan. I would say it was within the first
                    week I arrived. I had literally a physical sensation, a strange feeling in my
                    stomach, and I didn't know what it was but just something seemed wrong,
                    anomalous, and I wasn't quite sure what it was. That feeling didn't decline over
                    the next few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a student, you said, for the first three months
                        iVietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, although I was pulled off to cover, if you please, for the embassy,
                    that is for the embassy's security section, actions by the government troops at
                    the Xa Loi which was about four blocks from where I was living, as I said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that where the so-called bonze barbecues had taken
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, they had always taken place in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Thus, for example, one took place in front of the RomaCatholic
                    cathedral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. These were calculated, you know, thesimmolations, to attract
                    the maximum publicity and attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe, Bill, there was a list of people who had
                        volunteereto commit suicide in this fashion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the hierarchy allowed them to at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is so.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the political Buddhist hierarchy to my
                        understanding.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is so. The thing that was extraordinary is that there we are, outside
                    the Xa Loi Pagoda and we've got representatives of the three Armed Services
                    there, of the intelligence services, of the embassy, and all these American
                    reporters. You almost had as many Americans as you had Vietnamese security
                    forces at these pagodas. It was intrusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a press event, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was a press event. It was a performance, is what it was, really a
                    performance. There was a lot of shouting back and forth and occasionally there
                    was some wielding of truncheons and that sort of thing, but on the whole I don't
                    think that it was the cruelest thing imaginable, but then I didn't see
                    everything.</p>
                <p>At any rate when Ambassador Lodge arrived he decided he was going treorganize the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pulled out of your language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, I managed to take my language training but just before completing the
                    language training they said that I would not be in the Provincial Reporting Unit
                    as I had been told, instead I would be put in the Consular Section. I like music
                    very much and so what I said actually is, “Like Mimi in 'La Boh�me,' addio sensa
                    rancour... so long, no hard feelings.” I said, just give me a ticket and send me
                    back to the United States, I've had this training, we'll just write that off,
                    I'm going to be in the Consular Section where I'll not be using Vietnamese.
                    Let's just forget the whole scene, when can we leave, I'm sure Ruth will be
                    delighted to go.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I did take a trip around Vietnam in October, about two weeks before
                    the coup d'etat, with my wife. I took her to Dalat and to Hue and to Nha Trang,
                    so I took her to three very interesting places in Vietnam. One could still
                    travel around by air relatively easily. And so we had seen the country and there
                    we were in Saigon but what worried me to no small extent was that, first of all,
                    everywhere we had to travel by day. At night all bets were off and we were
                    confined whether we traveled or whether we remained in Saigon, to the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was travel outside of town or travel within the town
                        oSaigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MARSH: Outside of town, but outside of town was rather severely drawn. For
                    example, suburban areas were off limits. Gia Dinh Province, which was to the
                    northeast of Saigon, no, no, no you didn't do that. We went up to Dalat and that
                    is where we met the head of USOM, the AID mission, and his wife, who were at the
                    same hotel we were. He suggested a place that we would go to dinner called La
                    Savoisiennen, run by two old French women who'd been there for donkeys years and
                    it was a little bit out of town. To my horror, we went through a Vietcong
                    roadblock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the AID director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: With the AID director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the AID director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I don't recall, to tell you the truth, I really don't remember. But I'll
                    never forget that. He seemed oblivious to the whole thing but I knew what it was
                    because I did catch a few words, at that time. We are talking October of 1963.
                    But believe me this was not very far from the center of Dalat at all, but it was
                    at night. But we went and we had a very good dinner and we came back and the
                    roadblock had disappeared. It had moved on someplace else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the roadblock stop you? Did they chat with you a
                        little bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They sort of waved us through. I think at that time the Vietcong were not
                    particularly interested in having any contretemps with westerners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time you say there were about 18,000 or more
                        Americaforces, but they are not combat forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They are not combat forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were an advisory effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MARSH: They were strictly training, an advisory effort, plus they were cadre for
                    an eventual massive effort. Thus I remember, for example, meeting a Major whose
                    job it was to go over the Vietnam railway to see if it would handle tanks. I
                    happened to meet him in the officer's club in Nha Trang one time. I said to him
                    that of course it would not handle tanks. In the first place it is full of
                    tunnels and this is a narrow gauge line and very lightweight rail and you would
                    never get through it. He said, “Please, please, don't tell my superiors. This
                    has been a very nice trip.”</p>
                <p>Q: Fascinating. So we are back after three months of language training punctuated
                    by some work that you have described with security, and other issues, what did
                    you then do?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I was put in the external side, external political affairs, but
                    briefly. I was there for about a month or two and then put into the Provincial
                    Reporting program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, can you describe that program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The notion of the program was that officers trained in the Vietnamese
                    language would circulate throughout the country, spending a week or so in a
                    given provincial capital. Getting down with the U.S. military in those capitols,
                    but working pretty largely with the Vietnamese, the province chief, district
                    chiefs, provincial governments, local notables, Buddhist, Catholics, Cao Dai,
                    what have you. And then spend the next week in Saigon writing up a report on
                    that particular province as to how things were moving.</p>
                <p>I think that initially the idea was to try to keep a finger on the pulse of the
                    sects and the Buddhists in Vietnam. Now remember there were a number of
                    dissident sects, Cao Dai, Binh Xuyen, and so forth, as well as the majority
                    Buddhist population. But Buddhists varied greatly, that's a term of art. Those
                    of Hue had little in common with those in the Delta and in the mountains.</p>
                <p>Then in addition we were supposed to keep an eye on the various ethnic minorities
                    in the country, the Cham, the Montagnards, etc., and my special assignment,
                    because I had strong French, was to keep an eye on what the French were up to.
                    Everyone was very suspicious at that time of the de Gaulle government, and in
                    fact the French were considered hostile to us because whether due to their
                    smarting from their wounds and their expulsion from the area and their
                    resistance to the 'Yankification' of Indochina, I don't know. But in any event I
                    remember there was a distinctly hostile air coming out of Washington with
                    respect to the French.</p>
                <p>Now incidentally a number of those who had served in the embassy in Saigon, such
                    as Nolting, Truehart, Manfull, and others were old Paris hands. They were
                    regarded as rather Francophile and French sympathizers and they were replaced in
                    later years with those of Asian experience, rather than those with European
                    experience so that they would not be seen as doing service to the old colonial
                    masters.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Q: Bill that is a very interesting point. Let us go back for a minute to folks
                    like Truehart, Manfull and others. Do you think they were there because they
                    knew French and it was at one point or another a French-speaking post? Why do
                    you think they wound up there?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I guess probably that was the case. But also because they were people who
                    could appreciate the significance in Asian security of the French-speaking
                    countries of Indochina. You'll recall that SEATO was in operation, the Southeast
                    Asia Treaty Organization, and the French were members. These were people who
                    could keep an eye on things. Later the sort of favored country became the United
                    Kingdom, namely because of its success, or perceived success, in Malaya. But
                    under very different terms, of course.</p>
                <p>If we had in the '50s and early '60s, French advisors and confidential sources
                    among the French, we later tended to have British policemen. Thompson for
                    example, who had been the chief of police in Malaya, and so on, and others who
                    passed through Saigon and went on to Washington. President Nixon, for example,
                    made great use of Sir Robert Thompson from Malaya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember meeting him. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But there is one strong current in our policy that probably bears mention
                    at this time and that is that there was a fascination on the part of the
                    President, President Kennedy, with the guerrilla mystique. This meant that
                    Indo-China, particularly Vietnam, was to be a proving ground for America's
                    capability to conduct anti-guerrilla operations and to counter what was seen as
                    the spreading Chinese evangelism of guerrilla movements.</p>
                <p>It seems to me that this was very simplistic and I thought so at the time because
                    the Chinese Revolution was due to an awful lot more things than presumed
                    friendliness between the peasant and the guerrilla soldier.</p>
                <p>But this business that the people are the sea in which the fish, the guerrilla
                    swim, all that sort of thing. We had these slogans all of the time. Now the
                    answer to that problem perceived by President Kennedy and his brother, the
                    Attorney General and later Senator from New York, in no small part the answer
                    was to have been U.S. Special Forces. It was assumed that they could serve as
                    Western guerrillas, moving through the countryside, joining forces with the
                    people and so forth. This idea was totally erroneous.</p>
                <p>But later on when I was briefing on a fairly regular basis Senator Kennedy, in
                    his office, his first question was always, “How are the Special Forces
                    doing?”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was some years later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes that's right. But it was an abiding fascination and I think it was
                    kind of a premature Rambo syndrome that we had here, that heroic virtues were
                    the answer to these great revolutionary problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, at that time did you find yourself reading any of
                        thclassics of counter-insurgency or guerrilla warfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I already had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had, too. Can you elaborate on that because there was
                        quite cult of those books at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, first of all, I read “Sun Tsu,” which is what, the 11th or 12th
                    century, something of that sort, on the art of war. I read everything Bernard
                    Fall ever wrote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were in Vietnam or before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Before.</p>
                <p>Q: So in other words you had, let's just skip back for a minute, area
                    preparation? While you said it wasn't very strong, you had basically done a lot
                    of reading?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I tried to find out as much about the country as possible because I
                    wasn't getting anything at the Foreign Service Institute or from the desk. I
                    wanted to know what the place was like. Now as far as American policy was
                    concerned that always remained foggy. As long as I was attached with Vietnam it
                    was a foggy kind of thing and that you were largely supposed to intuit what to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. So you read Bernard Fall,
                        StreeWithout Joy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Various Fall writings? Anyone else?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Malraux. Quite a few things. Anything I could put my hands on, because it
                    was fascinating and it was obviously a darkening, gathering storm.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Q: Yes. Yes. Bill, you mentioned that at that time for a lot of people in
                    Washington Vietnam was among other things a proving ground for counter-guerrilla
                    warfare, counter-insurgency. How did that fit in to what you began to do then
                    with the Provincial Reporting Unit?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I had some advantages that others of my peers did not have. I had
                    been in the military and had some familiarity with military processes in
                    thinking and approaches and that sort of thing. On the other hand, one of the
                    most impressive things throughout this whole effort was to meet those junior
                    FSOs, Foreign Service officers, and your good name is foremost among them, who
                    had not been in the military. But FSOs who really had tremendous sense and
                    sensitivity to military situations, and to tactical as well as strategic
                    considerations. I was terribly impressed.</p>
                <p>For example, Richard Teare, who was a member of the staff, had never served in
                    the military but could go into a Province and then write an absolutely brilliant
                    report on the vulnerabilities of that Province in the military sense. The
                    problem was that our American military colleagues could not accept this. Now I
                    can recall that later, when Ambassador Taylor had arrived - Ambassador Taylor
                    had, of course, an immense prestige, an immense reputation - we really had
                    titans as ambassadors there in Lodge, Taylor, Lodge and Bunker, I think we had
                    the best you could possibly provide - but it was inconceivable for Ambassador
                    Taylor that civilians could analyze military situations. It was just totally
                    inconceivable because he was of a priesthood that could not admit the laity to
                    these mysteries, if you will. How do I know that? He told us so; that he
                    couldn't understand us making military judgments. That seemed completely wrong.
                    What we did was analyze, use our heads, sense and talk to a lot of people at a
                    lot of different ranks, enlisted lower-field grade and senior, both Vietnamese
                    and American.In any event, one had to be an autodidact, one had to teach oneself
                    here because the preparation for service in Vietnam was not very
                    considerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, the Provincial Reporting Unit, who was in charge of
                        thaunit at that time? Were you in charge of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, later I was. The first chief was James Rosenthal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: James D. Rosenthal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: James D. Rosenthal, an extraordinary public servant in my view and a very
                    close friend and a great man and I know you regard him very highly as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else was with you, Bill, who were your
                        colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MARSH: We had David Engel, whose efforts, I would like to put on record, whose
                    efforts for many years went unrewarded by the Service, a self-effacing kind of
                    man but whose contributions were colossal. We had John Negroponte, who became
                    Assistant Secretary of State and ambassador to Mexico and the Philippines, and
                    other places, Honduras.</p>
                <p>So we had people who did quite well afterwards. We would have had you, but you
                    were out of reach, you were no fool. You didn't put yourself in our clutches.
                    You were with AID.</p>
                <p>I want to put this on record, that when anybody disparages the Foreign Service, I
                    don't tolerate it I point out the work that you and your peers did for another
                    agency, in an unfamiliar situation, with great security problems and so forth,
                    and it was brilliant. Your work was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. For
                    example, Rob Warne, in the Delta, yourself, others, amazing what those young
                    officers, but who were well educated and terribly devoted, accomplished -
                    really, my hat is off to you all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, in provincial reporting, which provinces did you
                        spend timin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: At first I was assigned to those in central Vietnam, and later I took
                    those around the Saigon area. When I became the head of the unit, I was with
                    those around the Saigon area because, after all, rank has its privileges, right?
                    And I wanted to have less traveling. The traveling up to central Vietnam was
                    pretty hairy and the Delta was never an area that interested me very much. Not
                    because it was so infested with communist forces, which was true, but because
                    the dustiness of the place in the dry season made my sneezing so intense that I
                    couldn't talk to people, I was too busy using my handkerchief, so I stayed out
                    of there. I did visit, of course, the Delta to a certain extent and went the
                    length and breadth of the country.</p>
                <p>The uplands, the highlands, I also had a dust problem up there. In those days I
                    had considerable sensitivity to that sort of thing so I wanted to stay as close
                    to salt water as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. So you were going around central Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes that is right. Remember, we had a consulate in Hue at that time, so
                    the upper three provinces were looked after by our consulate in Hue. I came into
                    the picture a province or two north of Nha Trang and down the coast a couple of
                    provinces, and so forth. A center of considerable conflict between the Catholic
                    and Buddhist populations, the place from which the later President of Vietnam
                    had come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Nguyen Binh Thieu, the later president?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>MARSH: Yes that's correct, he was from that area. And, moreover, Nha Trang had
                    considerable strategic significance because of its magnificent harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were also beautiful places, Bill, aren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well...that was not...I appreciated that very much, but I gavthat up in
                    order to move down around the Saigon area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One personal question at that time, you were married and
                        familstill with you? Was Ruth, your wife, still with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, when we arrived in Vietnam... first of all, we were told we would
                    have a two-year tour, and we would never see Vietnam again. And so I would enjoy
                    my two years as consul in Nha Trang and then would have a nice home leave and
                    would never see the place again. Very soon after we arrived there was arbitrary
                    extension of the tour to three years and of course the Nha Trang option was
                    taken away. But for that matter the assignment was going to be completely
                    changed to make a consular officer out of me, rather than a field officer and I
                    didn't want that. Well, I did get the fieldwork, and we were there for three
                    years with a home leave at 18 months. That home leave came in February of 1965.
                    Ruth was with me. We had planned to go around the world. We were sitting in a
                    restaurant in Oklahoma one day and were told that the President was on
                    television and announced the departure of the families from Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were okay, right? By then, Bill, you had a son
                        already?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, no. On this home leave we had reached Oklahoma, where my wife's
                    parents lived, and we went on to Washington. It was there she learned she was
                    pregnant with our first child. So what we sought from the Department was advice:
                    should we go to safehaven, should we leave her there in the United States, what
                    exactly should we do? And we couldn't get any advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, what did you wind up doing? What did Ruth wind up
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I gave Ruth the option and we continued round the world anwe dropped her
                    off in Bangkok.</p>

                <p>MARSH: There were quite a few and far more than the embassy iBangkok found
                    comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they get housing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, they had to find it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had to find it...they had an allowance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Okay. It was a self-help project. MARSH: Yes,
                        quite.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it coming out of your pocket, Bill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct, so was the fare between Saigon and Bangkok. Later on,
                    years later, they instituted a paid fare for people to go back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think at that time Emily
                        Lodge,Henry Cabot Lodge's wife, also moved out of Saigon and went to
                        Bangkok.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: She did and she was wonderful to the Saigon wives, and particularly to
                    mine. They got along very, very well. Ambassador Lodge invited Dick Holbrooke
                    and me and some others to go with him on the jet that was provided for him to go
                    over to Bangkok to see his wife.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you and Dick and others had dependents that were
                        there.I imagine quite a lot of folks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. But he was close to us, we were in the embassy, he knew us
                    and that sort of thing. So he was very kind, very, very kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's terrific.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But the safehaven arrangements made by the Department were woefully
                    inadequate, more non-existent than actual and Embassy Bangkok was quite
                    unhelpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they friendly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No. Q: You weren't terribly welcome, is what you are saying.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, the thing that I have forgiven but can never forget was that when my
                    wife went into labor she had tried to get in touch with the Thai who drove for
                    her at the hotel where he usually hung out, and she couldn't reach him. She was
                    into frequent contractions and called the embassy and asked if they could send
                    her to get to the hospital in an embassy car. You will recall the notoriety of
                    Bangkok traffic. It is even worse today, but it was horrible then. She didn't
                    get transportation; she got a lecture from the general services officer that
                    Saigon wives were not supposed to bother Embassy Bangkok and were supposed to
                    look after their own matters. So she managed to get a taxi and she arrived at
                    the Bangkok Nursing Home Hospital in Bangkok barely in time, and the gentleman
                    who dealt with her in such an unthinking way later rose to very high rank in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, on the principle that good deeds shouldn't
                        remaiunpunished, who was this gentleman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: De mortuis nil nisi bonam (of the dead, nothing but good).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, point taken. Shall we go back a little to the
                        provinces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, let's do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're back to the provinces, Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MARSH: This was very interesting work, I must say, extremely interesting work. It
                    was totally unstructured. We identified what was worthy of reporting or not,
                    whom we would see, we were totally on our own with no supervision out there in
                    the field. Now we had certain general guidelines from the embassy, to be sure,
                    but if we decided we would see X or Y or Z, usually there were no requirement
                    that we call back the embassy for permission. Not everything was ad referendum,
                    we had considerable initiative and got around and it was very interesting. It
                    was also an exposure to danger that I never had in the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating, fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I'm sure you as well as I have driven over mined roads. I'm sure you as
                    well as I had been in a town encircled by Vietcong in a night attack. I'm sure
                    you as well as I had been very, very close to a napalm retaliatory attack by
                    U.S. forces. This was something.</p>
                <p>Now, the gods were with me in that I was asked to delay my home leave in 1965 by
                    a couple of weeks because John Negroponte, who was working for me, wanted to go
                    off on a trip. I was furious because I had everything planned and I had to
                    recast everything. Well, what it meant was that I was away when the embassy was
                    subjected to a terrorist attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was March of 1965.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was March 30th of 1965, and I happened to be in Athenat that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It got bombed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And it got bombed, that is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was out of town, too. I was out of the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I think you and I, as glasses wearers, were particularly lucky not to be
                    there because a number of people lost their eyesight as a consequence of that
                    explosion. The doctor in the CIA, you'll recall, was blinded. He was looking out
                    to see what all the excitement was about outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was considered lucky at that time, Bill, if you didn't
                        have window view or if you were facing away from the window.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. That is correct.</p>
                <p>Q: You would have some shards in the back of your scalp, as did Mel Levine. I
                    remember Mel Levine had to have surgery for the back of his head to have the
                    glass pieces taken out.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. And Jim Rosenthal, our leader of the Provincial Reporting Unit, was
                    badly cut in the face. It was very bad. But those people all were given
                    magnificent treatment by the embassy. The embassy gave them one day off. One day
                    off!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, it sounds like a health maintenance
                        organizatiothese days, dealing with someone's delivery of a child.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: May I comment about that incident?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, of course, Bill. We have about a minute left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: There had been a report, an intelligence report, of an impending attack.
                    Someone suggested putting back the concrete barriers that had stood in front of
                    the embassy to prevent traffic from coming and the decision was taken at very
                    high level that this was nonsense, and we were not going to be cowed by this
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: So, the Vietcong drove right into the lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...drove right into the lobby. At this point, let's take a

                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is December 30, 1997. This is a continuation of an interviewith Mr. William
                    H. Marsh.</p>
                <p>Bill, Happy New Year. Last time we talked we had discussed work in Saigon that
                    you were doing. We discussed provincial reporting. You had quite a lot of
                    interesting stuff in that regard and then we came up to the very dramatic moment
                    of March 30, 1965, when the American embassy was badly bombed. You were luckily
                    out of the country. At that point we stopped.</p>
                <p>Bill, what were you doing after that, what is the next sequence oevents?</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MARSH: First, Happy New Year to you, Vlad. It's good to be with yoand is indeed
                    like old times.</p>
                <p>Upon returning to the embassy in early April of 1965 from a home leave which
                    itself had been charged with emotion in that while we were in Oklahoma,
                    President Johnson ordered out the families so that we knew that my wife could
                    not return to Saigon. We reached Washington to find out that she was pregnant
                    with our first child, and we had to stop at Bangkok on the way back in order to
                    get her established. I left her pregnant in the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok with
                    two cotton dresses and no place to live. So it's an unsung story of heroism
                    which I think deserves to be mentioned because spouses get very little, very
                    little appreciation from the Foreign Service and from the Department
                    generally.</p>
                <p>In any event, to return to the shattered embassy, where my desk was under a pile
                    of rubble and where there were two large boxes on that desk. We had ordered some
                    hurricane lamps from Neiman-Marcus and they had been sent. I was just going to
                    pick them up and toss them out but I didn't hear any tinkle of glass. I opened
                    them and they were in perfect condition. We used them for years. I wrote Stanley
                    Marcus and said he would never believe what a packing department he had. I got
                    back a very nice letter from him saying they get a lot of gripes, but this was
                    the first time they had ever gotten praise like that.</p>
                <p>In any event, we got our lives reestablished. It was really like an entirely new
                    tour because it was now a bachelor tour; it was now obviously a wartime tour.
                    The explosion I think had finally dispelled any pretense that we were there to
                    look after civil action or police action, or anything of that sort.
                    Incidentally, the powers that be in the embassy had given all of those who had
                    experienced the explosion a day off. One day off. Which was certainly generous,
                    wasn't it!</p>
                <p>At any rate we then set up the work. Jim Rosenthal had been the Head of
                    Provincial Reporting and he left in early summer. So then I became Head of
                    Provincial Reporting and remained Head of Provincial Reporting for the next, oh,
                    nine or 10 months, something of that sort. I had to reorganize. We had an
                    increasingly massive American military presence and the beginnings of American
                    military intervention, if you will, starting in the fall of 1965.</p>
                <p>Now there was something that happened then, in the fall, that we did not assess
                    properly, I think. That was that the American desire for a classical battlefield
                    confrontation with the Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces was granted. This in
                    the Ia Drang Valley, and American forces were defeated, in effect, at that time.
                    This had a great influence on the U.S. military, I believe, but we did not have
                    the feeling, the full assessment of that. One of the things was that we really
                    were not accompanying U.S. military forces on military operations. Now right at
                    this point...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which battle was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MARSH: Ia Drang... the Ia Drang Valley. That was a pitched battle and American
                    forces came off second best with heavy losses. Before the military, or military
                    historians, or whoever may be listening to this start reaching for their
                    war-clubs, I should say I am not suggesting a system of political commissars.
                    But I am saying that when you have a war which has mixed civilian and military
                    elements, and in which civilians and diplomats at that are supposed to be doing
                    reporting, providing full coverage of these sorts of things, there should be at
                    least sampling for those civilians on military operations.</p>
                <p>Now you, Vlad, and I, both had experience of small scale, small unit stuff out in
                    the Provinces. I'm sure that you had the experience that I had in Ham Nghia
                    Province, just west of Saigon. They handed me a weapon and said I would have to
                    use it as the Vietcong surrounded us. They had called in an air strike but I
                    might have to fight off attackers at this compound. This was in the middle of
                    the night. I'm sure you had experiences of that sort.</p>
                <p>But at the level of field grade officers out in the field, we did have that
                    opportunity to observe military situations. At more senior levels, and with
                    larger units, we did not and that's a pity because we did not really get the
                    full measure of what was happening in Vietnam with the American effort. Namely,
                    that the American military power was proving inefficacious there.</p>
                <p>So we did our reporting. I may have mentioned the work of Richard Teare, who was
                    one of the fellows on my staff and how he had done a very honest report of the
                    vulnerabilities of a certain province. The military wouldn't clear it. Phil
                    Habib, the political counselor, asked him to go back and do another assessment
                    and see if he had done everything right - and he couldn't land at the provincial
                    capital because the Vietcong had overrun the air field and occupied it! But that
                    didn't influence the Military Assistance Command-Vietnam at all.</p>
                <p>Now one experience of mine, two in fact, seemed to me demonstrate the problems
                    that we had confronting a major general staff operation. The first was, at a
                    time that I was acting consul in Hue, I was called up to the Ben Hai River which
                    was the boundary, you'll recall, between North and South Vietnam. U.S. Navy
                    aircraft bombing had destroyed the bridge over that river. The Canadian members
                    of the International Control Commission had signaled this to me. I got there at
                    once, looked it over. The bridge was in ruins. I got on the phone, called the
                    embassy and said they should please get in touch with MACV because U.S. Navy
                    aircraft had destroyed the famous bridge, which had great, symbolic importance,
                    as you will recall. MACV's response to this when informed was (A) there were no
                    U.S. Navy aircraft anywhere in that vicinity because they had been attacking
                    Vinh, which was something like a hundred miles to the north, and (B) I deserved
                    a reprimand because I shouldn't have been in the demilitarized zone there. I
                    never did understand the latter and, of course, the former point was totally
                    fallacious.</p>
                <p>But they insisted that the bridge was intact and that there waabsolutely no
                    problem with them.</p>

                <p>A second incident was rather interesting, I think. I went to see an old French
                    planter in Phuoc Long Province, which was along the Cambodian border north of
                    Saigon. He gave me a rather full accounting of how the Vietcong were raising
                    considerable funds from the workers on rubber plantations. As the workers came
                    up to draw their wages in cash from the table where he and the other employers
                    sat there was a Vietcong agent who took a percentage off this for the cause's
                    coffers. I wrote this up and got a query, ultimately, from MACV, how did I get
                    there, since there was no military airfield? I said that I drove and MACV
                    responded that was impossible, I could not have driven because the only road
                    between the provincial capital and that plantation was heavily mined. My
                    response was, sorry, I did go and was here to prove that I had made the trip
                    successfully. In which case, once again, MACV said I deserved a reprimand.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, what you are saying, if I understand it, the point of Ben Hai and this
                    second episode, is that when you get a very large command it doesn't know what
                    is happening on the ground. Is that the moral of the story?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Let me speak of a time, and there were numerous times, when I happened to
                    participate in briefings of Secretary McNamara. As a matter of fact I
                    accompanied Secretary McNamara, I believe earlier I mentioned how he insisted on
                    using a Vietnamese phrase which he distorted and it became totally
                    counterproductive. At any rate once again I was in a briefing and I happened to
                    be sitting next to a Major Schweitzer, who later became a General and was at the
                    White House. He was a very forthright man of very good but rather blunt
                    reputation in speaking. He was listening at that time because provincial
                    advisors had been brought in to brief McNamara and of course they did very
                    little talking. It was the staff chiefs from MACV who did the talking to the
                    Secretary of [Defense] and all these people were supposed to do was nod in
                    agreement when things were said.</p>
                <p>At one point Schweitzer leaned toward me and said, “Did you hear what he just
                    said? He said the Vietcong in Binh Long Province has no mortar capability.”
                    Schweitzer said, “I've got a piece of the shell in my leg from a mortar.” He
                    went and took this up with MACV and they disallowed that it was a mortar, he was
                    mistaken. So he didn't even know what had hit him, according to them. An
                    interesting thing to me was that at one time field representatives of MACV were
                    not authorized to receive combat pay, but the Saigon staff of MACV was.</p>
                <p>These were distortions. It was difficult for us to know how to deal with them.
                    And as a matter of fact the unprecedented nature of these sorts of problems
                    meant that our superiors, our diplomatic superiors, didn't quite know how to
                    deal with these matters. They found it difficult to give us guidance. Partly
                    because they believed that we should have little guidance because if we were
                    going to go out and report, we should not be biased in any respect by that. But
                    it made it very difficult, frankly, to know what to look for and what was
                    permissible and what was impermissible. Well, we soon learned.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>First of all, Ambassador Taylor, Maxwell Taylor, as I mentioned before I believe,
                    did not see a military reporting role for civilians. That was just totally
                    unprofessional as far as he was concerned. Henry Cabot Lodge, on the other hand,
                    who returned in 1965, believed very thoroughly in us and in our work and used
                    and relied on us a great deal. I was there for the second tour of Henry Cabot
                    Lodge.</p>
                <p>We saw and learned a great deal, I think, and the difficulty came in transmitting
                    this and then seeing it was useful to policy-makers, decision-makers. I
                    remember, for example, the U.S. Division located west of Saigon, I think this
                    was a little later but at any rate, I asked how many vehicles they had for the
                    troops and was told there was a vehicle for every two. The Lieutenant General
                    shocked me with that statement. I said, “I beg your pardon, there is a vehicle
                    for every two men you have?” And he replied, “Yes, Americans don't walk, they
                    drive.” Well, that meant we were going to flood that country with materiel for
                    by this time we had a quarter-million people in the country, you see. But
                    Americans don't walk? Not even soldiers? Not even young men? No, they drive.</p>
                <p>There were anomalies of that sort and it was very difficult to know how to put
                    them all together. The confusions were manifest. I think one of the most
                    important confusions that we saw was that in a war which was so inherently
                    political in its compass and in its motivations, the U.S. military weren't quite
                    sure how to provide guidance and to direct their own people. I remember once a
                    conversation with General Westmoreland in which I said the troops had more money
                    than some of them had ever seen in their lives before or were ever likely to see
                    again. Could one not take the system used by the Peace Corps, which rather banks
                    the volunteers' money and then gave it to them when they left? They were able to
                    use that for school or to buy a house or make down payment on a house or an
                    automobile or what have you.</p>
                <p>Troops were going out with great enormous batches of money on R&amp;R to Hong
                    Kong and to Bangkok and buying a lot of junk and wasting money in bars and in
                    general driving up prices all over the place. This had an inflationary impact on
                    the economies out there that was not in accord with our war aims for that
                    region. General Westmoreland thought that was a nifty idea and he checked with
                    his people and they told him that it would be too demoralizing, we could not do
                    that. I was struck by the fact that rather sadly he said, “You know, we should,
                    but we can't.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, work was appreciated by at least one group. There were eight of us
                    Provincial Reporters and MACV set up a Processing Unit. And the Processing Unit
                    simply took our reports, processed them, reproduced them, sent them around the
                    military chain of command and so forth and it was staffed with over fifty
                    people. It had no reportorial, no editorial, functions whatsoever. It was
                    strictly reproduction and distribution. Now that was very flattering to know
                    that that would be done on that basis.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Now we, from '65, noticed that there was a tone of increasing desperation coming
                    in. Foreign Service officers are pretty sophisticated people, or at least they
                    used to be. When people are always talking about success instead of letting the
                    events themselves proclaim the success there must be something wrong. It became
                    a little suspicious. We heard this more and more urgently, about the supposedly
                    growing light at the end of the tunnel, as Phil Habib heard when he went to the
                    conference with President Johnson in Wake Island, I think it was, and so forth
                    and so on. And we had success stories coming in all the time.</p>
                <p>But as Henry Cabot Lodge said to some military briefers - and this was a man who
                    had such enormous presence, such an aura about him and so forth, who could
                    really put people in respect of him just by walking or standing nearby or that
                    sort of thing - but at any rate he said in that wonderful Boston Brahmin accent,
                    “General, I'm told there is significant progress made in reducing the Vietcong
                    threat to Saigon, but I noticed that there is even more gunfire every night than
                    there was during my first tour here. How is it then, that there has been such
                    progress.” And of course the response was a long, long, series of stutters on
                    the part of the military briefer who could not do that.”</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, can I just go back, you said there was a tone of desperation that was
                    noticeable by that point, in 1965, can you give some examples of that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: The search for negotiations. I'm not sure how we got this, I think maybe
                    we FSOs at the embassy in Saigon got it from osmosis, to tell you the truth. But
                    we knew there was a very active search to undertake a negotiated settlement of
                    matters. We also heard that there was a limitation on the amount of forces. We
                    were going to put in another 50,000, another 100,000, but these would be brief
                    and just as soon as we got things cleaned up out they'd come and that sort of
                    thing. At the same time, oddly enough, the Secretary of State was saying, in
                    effect, we are there for as long as it takes and to do whatever is required. So
                    there is a little contradiction there in that kind of thing. But we had more and
                    more and more visitors and we had an increasing confrontation with the press and
                    you will recall that.</p>
                <p>The press could find very little, very little, that was commendable in our effort
                    out there, and a great deal that was condemnatory. I remember when the New York
                    Daily News manufactured a story about Doug Ramsey, one of our colleagues, who
                    was taken prisoner there and said that he was privy to the innermost secrets of
                    the Mission Council and all of that kind of thing. We were shocked at the
                    vindictiveness of the story and the sheer viciousness of it. And so we looked to
                    Barry Zorthian of USIA and said, why isn't Joe Freed, the reporter, why isn't he
                    just cut out of the pattern here. None of us would ever talk to him again. And
                    Zorthian pleaded with us, no, no, no we had to try to keep on the good side of
                    the press, we had to inform the public, blah, blah, blah, blah and we
                    counter-argued that this man was not informing the public but misinforming it.
                    He was harming our own colleagues in the process.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>We got nowhere with that sort of thing and we said to ourselves there is
                    desperation here. We were not even showing any real, masculine vigor in what we
                    were doing here; we were kowtowing to everyone. Also we had experts running
                    through Saigon constantly. Dr. Kissinger was there, Sir Robert Thompson came
                    through to give us the benefit of his Malaya experience of the 1950s, although
                    what that had to do with anything we were never quite sure. Then we had Bernard
                    Fall and others who knew the French experience. Come one, come all! There was
                    not a calm sense of assurance; there was a frenzy of trying every possible
                    solution.</p>
                <p>I remember the day that McNamara was told about the ramasseurs, these were the
                    middlemen, mainly Chinese, who gathered the rice from individual farmers and
                    then wholesaled it to the major urban markets in Vietnam or, in the old days, it
                    was exported. But the ramasseurs were in a briefing and were suspected of
                    diverting a certain amount of rice to the Vietcong. And McNamara said we would
                    take over rice distribution, and we did! Actually it all fell back into the
                    ramasseurs' hands, its just that you had an American seemingly directing it or
                    distributing it or dealing with that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>At any rate we were trying to build nationhood for South Vietnam and at the same
                    time we're taking away one of their principal economic endeavors. I call this
                    desperation. I think we all had this sense of unease at the way things were
                    going, plus the fact that we were eating, sleeping, drinking Vietnam. We talked
                    of nothing else. You will recall, Vlad, how we used to get together for dinner,
                    a dozen of us, something of that sort, we'd go to somebody's house and we'd have
                    drinks and then we'd have dinner. All night long we talked about nothing but
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I can remember one time with Dick Holbrooke. I was saying for God's sake couldn't
                    we discuss, you know, what was at the movies, or sex, whatever, anything. He
                    looked at me and I'll never forget Dick's expression. He looked at me,
                    curiously, as if to say “what's wrong with him” and went on with what was
                    probably the fourth or fifth hour of a discussion among colleagues as to what
                    was going on in Vietnam. And here again we were so obsessed that we didn't have
                    “a life,” as the kids would put it, today. We lost a life. And everything was
                    like that. This was desperation; this was desperation, because things simply
                    were not going according to plan.</p>
                <p>By the way there is a magnificent story about Lord Carrington at Dunkirk in 1940,
                    wading out to an evacuation ship. A man turned to Carrington and said, “Somehow
                    I have the feeling that things are not going quite according to plan.” We had
                    that feeling, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, what happened next with your own professional
                        activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>MARSH: In the spring of 1966, Samuel Thomsen had been consul in Hue and had a
                    very junior officer at the time, Jim Bullington, who later became an ambassador
                    in Africa, at the consulate with him. Because of Sam's responsibilities with the
                    Marines there, and because General Walt of the Marine Division really needed a
                    political advisor, I was sent to Hue temporarily.</p>
                <p>Now I was rather frantic because I had a matter of a few months before leaving
                    Vietnam and I was desperately trying to get orders for myself but certainly also
                    for my wife and son, who had been born by this time. The Department had not yet
                    recognized that I was a married man. This stuff had been going on for years; we
                    were now in the fourth year of this. They still couldn't get it straight that I
                    was married. They could accept, however, that I had a son, but they couldn't
                    accept that I was married!</p>
                <p>In any event we are up there and the scene is percolating like nobody's business
                    because we have the usual university riots, we have the usual Buddhist
                    demonstrations, and at the same time we have intense activity on the part of the
                    Vietcong and certain North Vietnamese forces. Though we are not broadcasting
                    that fact, that they are present, but we know it full well. At one point I was
                    witnessing, observing I should say, a demonstration of the Buddhists. I was
                    standing out of sight, trying to be an inconspicuous as somebody 6'2” tall and
                    6'2” wide can be and a great flotilla of U.S. helicopters went overhead and
                    disappeared to the north. Then about an hour later it reappeared with stretchers
                    attached to the struts. You've seen that, I'm sure, Vlad, bringing back the
                    American casualties and so forth. And of course the demonstrators paid
                    absolutely no mind, any attention to this whatsoever.</p>
                <p>I said to myself at the time that this was ridiculous. Here are people who are
                    not involved in their own salvation; instead mercenaries are doing their work
                    for them. Mercenaries is the wrong term because they were not even being paid
                    for it, we were paying for it, as a matter of fact, and that sort of thing.
                    Things were very bad and I recommended that the Consulate be closed. Well, I was
                    at that time a relatively junior officer and they weren't going to take my word
                    for it so they sent Tom Corcoran up. Now Tom Corcoran was the number two in the
                    Political Section. He was the deputy to Phil Habib, and had replaced Bob Miller,
                    who had been badly hurt in the embassy explosion. He had been deputy political
                    counselor, a wonderful guy. Tom Corcoran, God rest his soul, he was a marvelous
                    man and had served in every post the U.S. had ever had in Indo-China, as a
                    matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He closed most of them down.</hi>

                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MARSH: He closed most of them down, that's right. And he recommended that Hue be
                    closed down. He seconded what I had found. And of course they couldn't act on
                    the thing and so the Buddhists closed it for us, as a matter of fact, by just
                    closing off. Well, it's very difficult from a place like Hue to try to arrange
                    your next assignment and it is also very difficult to try to get your
                    family...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We closed Hue and we closed your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct, at that time. That's right. But the Buddhists had already
                    burned down the USIS building there, their offices, in Hue.</p>
                <p>One story I have to tell you because it exemplifies the disorganization of the
                    American effort. I was at my desk in Hue one day, trying to write the umpteen
                    cables that had to go every day to Saigon to describe a rapidly deteriorating
                    situation. A great Wagnerian lady burst into the room and she said she was from
                    the Higher Education Division of AID, or at least she had been engaged by them
                    to work on the academic programs at the University of Hue. I said, “Madam, the
                    university is closed.” She peered over an impressive bosom at me and said,
                    “Well, open it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, ye of little faith!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Now how this woman had ever managed to come from the United States, and to
                    pass through the AID offices in Saigon, and get a plane and come up to Hue I
                    will never understand. But on the other hand, I could never understand
                    encountering at certain battles that I did attend American tourists. And no
                    necessarily adventuresome kids, young people, sometimes rather mature people who
                    decided to go out and see the war themselves. It reminded me a bit of what
                    apparently happened at First Bull Run, you will remember, when all of the people
                    from Washington went down in carriages to have a look.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>This was what it was like. It was a terribly, terribly complicated thing. There
                    was a fellow named Ed Grainger, who was an AID officer in Phu Yen Province. His
                    wife was a good friend of my wife in Bangkok, where they were both living in
                    safehaven. Elizabeth Grainger, who was a very soft-spoken, lovely British woman
                    said one time that she was having a hard time of it financially. Ruth, my wife,
                    told me this. The reason was that when the Vietcong had taken Ed, his salary had
                    stopped! So when on my next trip to Bangkok Ruth told me about this on my return
                    to Saigon, I went in to see Charlie Mann, who was the director of AID. I said
                    this was unconscionable. He was outraged and called in his principal comptroller
                    and said that he couldn't understand why the Grainger family had not received
                    any money and the comptroller looked him straight in the eye and said, “Because
                    he hasn't submitted a time card.” With that Charlie blew up. I was glad to see
                    that. He said, “You will pay him. You will pay Mrs. Grainger the money due him,
                    and you will pay it immediately.” The comptroller looked at Charlie Mann again,
                    directly in the eye, and said, “You don't have the authority to tell me to do
                    that, Mr. Director.”</p>
                <p>Well, finally, on his personal recognizance, if you will, Charlie Mann did
                    arrange that she got paid. What's my point? My point is that we had the conflict
                    of outworn regulations and practices in contradiction with extraordinary
                    circumstances of a military nature, of an emergency nature. Incidentally, Ed
                    Grainger never did return from his imprisonment by the Vietcong. They killed
                    him.</p>
                <p>But in any event, dealing with all that sort of situation, it was quite a
                    complication. Well, the orders finally came and to my great dismay I was ordered
                    to the Vietnam Working Group in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you unhappy about that, Bill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was unhappy about it because, let's see, I was 35 years of age and had
                    never served at a conventional, traditional, normal Foreign Service Post. Never.
                    In future years people would cast that up to me.</p>
                <p>Now one has omens, or they seem to be omens at the time, at least this is my
                    experience. Before taking up a new assignment sometimes there are a succession
                    of minor crises that precede it in one's personal life, and sure enough they
                    foreshadow a very difficult tour and assignment and all. I had to get my wife
                    and son on a plane in Bangkok to Hong Kong to wait for me. This involved at
                    Bangkok running across Bangkok airport to get my Air Vietnam flight back to
                    Saigon. Almost getting run over by about six jets in the process, returning to
                    Saigon, finding out that the cultural revolution had erupted in Hong Kong, and
                    then the night before my departure from Saigon there was the first time the
                    Vietcong had shelled Saigon airport.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We then took the President Cleveland from Hong Kong to San Francisco but there
                    was one problem on route. At shore leave at Yokohama we missed the boat and had
                    to take a lighter out to the ship and climb up a ladder up about seven storeys
                    up the side of the liner, with a six month old baby boy stuck inside my coat.
                    These were harbingers of some very trying times to come.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, this is fascinating stuff and we have a few minutes more on this side.
                    Should we start with Washington or should we take a little break and have a cup
                    of coffee?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Let's take a cup of coffee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful idea, I think that's a good idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is December 30, 1997. Bill, we are back in 1966. You arrived in Washington
                    to be on the Vietnam Desk, which I think was the Vietnam Working Group.</p>
                <p>MARSH: That is so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us a bit about that group, Bill? How was it
                        seup and what was it doing right and what was it doing wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was a very ecumenical sort of assembly. As a matter of fact, for a
                    while there was even a Peace Corps representative on it and, of course, the
                    Peace Corps never served in Vietnam. But there were representatives of numerous
                    agencies...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: International voluntary services...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, no. Not at that time. There were strictlgovernment agency
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very ecumenical group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: We had them from all over and gradually there was a decline over the
                    years, less and less and less outside representation, shall we say. It became a
                    State show. Now in '66 there were two developments that were particularly
                    striking.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>First of all, we were now in the third year of the search for political stability
                    in South Vietnam and it was as far away as ever. There had been a significant
                    revival of popular dissension and demonstration against the ever-changing
                    governmental authorities of the South. So that search seemed as illusory as
                    ever.</p>
                <p>Secondly there was a rapidly rising tide of dissension in the United States and
                    very surprising things indeed were happening there. Great rallies in Washington
                    against the war, the isolation and even confinement of the President of the
                    United States. I remember one time when he planned to go to the Century Plaza
                    Hotel in Los Angeles to give a speech. President Johnson's people told him that
                    within 24 hours of the announcement that he would talk there, California
                    dissidents would arrange that 100,000 people would be present to protest against
                    it, and that that number would probably increase.</p>
                <p>You'll remember that at about that time the Secretary of State went in an
                    unmarked vehicle into the basement of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Because in
                    order to appear at the United Nations and to meet with people he would have had
                    great difficulty getting through the lines of protestors outside.</p>
                <p>There are two factors of the times as well that I would like to mention, because
                    the younger listeners, if there are some to this, will probably not be familiar
                    with that sort of thing. The first was the Foreign Service had a tradition of
                    noblesse oblige at that time. Moreover many of those in the Foreign Service had
                    been in the military and considered the Foreign Service as a kind of
                    para-military organization, at least as far as Vietnam was concerned.</p>
                <p>What this meant was that we were much more accepting of authority than seems to
                    be the case today and that we simply did not question, at that time, or argue,
                    in any event, with decisions that were handed down to us. Thus it was that when
                    the deputy assistant secretary of State for then Far Eastern Affairs, later East
                    Asia and Pacific Affairs, with responsibility for Vietnam among other countries
                    in Southeast Asia, Leonard Unger, decided that he had better have virtually
                    continuous coverage. Thus John Helble and I, who were the political officers on
                    the Vietnam Working Group, had to take turns covering the night duty in the
                    Operations Center. What that meant was that we worked 36 hours on, 12 off. We
                    did this for a number of months. We did this seven days a week. And we did this
                    30 or 31 days a month, depending on the month. And it didn't really occur to us
                    to say we were exhausted because that wasn't done.</p>
                <p>I did question that my superiors made no mention of these marathon reports in my
                    Efficiency Report written in the spring of 1967, and it fell on totally deaf
                    ears. Those involved could not understand what I was talking about when I said
                    that working so many hours constantly was just taking years off my life span,
                    and off John Helble's life span, as well, to be perfectly fair with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>What I do remember was an example of how ill coordinated the Department was.
                    Whereas I lived in Washington and could take a bus to and from work, John Helble
                    lived out in what was then considered near - West Virginia, that is to say,
                    Falls Church. Which was then about as far from the action as one could be and
                    decidedly frowned upon as not a very classy place to be, way out there six miles
                    away in the countryside. But he used a car. There was no metro in those days, of
                    course. Well, don't you know, in the middle of this, they took his parking
                    permit away and so he was spending an absolute fortune, as you can imagine, for
                    a garage space outside that sometimes would be 36 hours in length. But we tended
                    to work eight to eight and then, if we worked through the night, then we stayed
                    the following day and went home at eight o'clock or some 36 hours after we
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>The reason was that we were supposed to call Saigon about every hour or two. Why?
                    Because the percolation throughout South Vietnamese society of that Buddhist
                    uprising in Central Vietnam, that I told you about, in that year, plus the
                    uncertain role of Lieutenant General Thi, who was Corps Commander in Central
                    Vietnam and who looked as if he had separatist ambitions there. Well, there we
                    were.</p>
                <p>There were those on the staff who were busily working on preparations for
                    negotiations, which of course came to no fruition during that period of time,
                    and the like. We had a White House constantly in search of progress reports,
                    achievements, something that it could talk about with the public to show that
                    things were going better than indeed they were.</p>
                <p>We had one period in which the President had decided that, this was in 1967, in
                    preparation for the following year's Presidential and Congressional elections,
                    somebody had better answer the criticisms that were appearing in great number in
                    the Congressional Record. So the President said that he wanted complete
                    rebuttals sent to the White House the day that the Congressional Record came
                    out. Now what that meant was that one of us had to go to the mailroom of the
                    Department, around seven o'clock in the morning, and go through the mailbags and
                    try to find Congressional Records. Now the Department could not do this for us;
                    they could not put this together for us. So it was amusing because the first day
                    that I did it, I came out of the mailroom so filthy dirty that my dress clothes
                    that I had for the office were hopeless. So I had an old raincoat and I used to
                    wear this old raincoat and then go diving in and go through all these mailbags
                    in order to get them upstairs as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>Why did we have to do that? Well, you see, there was a noon deadlinon submission
                    on the letters of rebuttal...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would put on a raincoat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MARSH: I'd put on this old raincoat and then we proceeded to go through the
                    Congressional Record each day and find the insertions made by members or the
                    remarks put in by members critical of the U.S. effort in Vietnam. Then we
                    proceeded to write rebuttals of that. We had to have all of these fully cleared
                    and upstairs in the Staff Secretariat by noon. Then they would make their way
                    over to the White House and would be signed off by the President that night.</p>
                <p>This was a colossal effort because we averaged 50 rebuttals and we had a brand
                    new young lady named Barbara White, whom you may have heard of, I believe she
                    went to Moscow somewhat later. She had just come in from New Mexico, I think it
                    was, and this was really her first job. She was really the most extraordinary
                    worker that you can imagine. Remember she was using a manual typewriter, this
                    was prior to the days of electric typewriters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Ms. White?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: She was just a young civil service person, a colleague in the Vietnam
                    working Group. And she just ground out these letters which we just started
                    scribbling as soon as we could. Fortunately a number of them dealt with the same
                    theme and so we were able to crib from one to the other and we didn't have to
                    write 50 individual letters. But we certainly had to write 10 or 15 and get them
                    cleared throughout the Bureau, through the rest of the Department, and up there
                    by twelve o'clock noon. Well, this was not work, this was frenzy for heaven's
                    sake, and it was an absolutely frenzied operation.</p>
                <p>You know the consequence of this was that the Public Correspondence Division of
                    the Department was established. Before that time there had not been one to deal
                    with such matters. But for several months we had to put up with this and it was
                    incredible. The workload was extraordinary.</p>
                <p>First of all, there was the old problem of obtaining information. What was going
                    on in Vietnam? How to sift, how to sort in the official reporting, and then in
                    the non-governmental reporting, particularly, of course, the press but also the
                    television, to try to identify what actually informed us and to respond to what
                    was simply a criticism or detraction. This was an enormous effort. I remember
                    one evening I left at eight o'clock and I was the first person to leave the
                    Working Group that night. Somebody made cracks like, oh, what, are you on leave?
                    That sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Tony Lake wanted to see a sister whom he had not seen for a number of years. Now
                    Tony at that time was Ambassador Unger's staff aide, and he had arranged to
                    spend a couple of hours with her on a Saturday afternoon, mid-afternoon. Tony,
                    it turned out, could not be spared that day and did not see his sister. This was
                    all that way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Ambassador Unger had been ambassador to Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his role at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Deputy assistant secretary, with responsibility for Vietnam.</p>
                <p>There were humorous sides to the Herculean efforts we were putting in. One time
                    Ambassador Unger asked us all to wait and we would go together with him to the
                    Vietnam National Day celebration at its embassy. We were so late when we finally
                    left the Department that we arrived at an absolutely empty South Vietnamese
                    embassy and they had to go find Bui Diem, who was then the ambassador, to come
                    down from upstairs, and say hello to us. There is nothing like going to a party
                    when there is nobody there! So it went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was 1966?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: 1966 perhaps part of '67. Now 1967, it seems to me, was a year that was
                    extremely misleading. It was misleading because in the first instance there was
                    a considerable abatement of the internal political dissension within South
                    Vietnam. The Central Vietnam crisis faded, waned, and not only that but there
                    seemed to be some institution building because there were elections,
                    Presidential elections, Parliamentary elections, and there was the election of
                    Nguyen Van Thieu as President of Vietnam. So you had the first elected President
                    in four years.</p>
                <p>I went to Vietnam for the elections in the company of Ambassador Henry Cabot
                    Lodge, who by this time had returned to the United States, who shepherded a
                    group of prominent Americans to act as sort of unofficial election
                    observers.</p>
                <p>The second misleading problem was that there was a decline in military activity.
                    By Christmas of '67 there was the possibility that perhaps we had made
                    substantial headway militarily. The absence of enemy military activity was
                    heartening and perhaps a sign, and it was a sign but we didn't know just exactly
                    what it was a sign of, we learned that in '68 at Tet. The President decided that
                    he would go out and visit the troops in December of 1967 at Cam Ranh Bay. Then
                    go on to visit the Pope, who was a symbol of peace. The President would be able
                    to report on to him that matters were preceding satisfactorily and that we were
                    hoping for negotiations soon on the grounds of the improved situation within the
                    country, as it was then seen.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>In the United States, however, the public uproar still rose and the clamor
                    continued very badly. There was not any appeasement of the public
                    dissatisfaction. Much of it we realize now was occasioned by the Draft and in
                    fact once the Draft was done away with, and the university students no longer
                    had to be concerned about that, the anti-war movement declined very rapidly. But
                    it still was in full measure.</p>
                <p>I think that many of the FSOs were from Missouri on what the situation was like
                    in South Vietnam, well, let's wait and see what's going on. And there was some
                    reporting that the Vietcong and North Vietnamese were making preparations for
                    intensified fighting and so forth, but again we'd always had reporting that
                    varied 180 degrees. You know, it's hot, it's cold, it's up, and it's down.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me just ask a pointed question here. You're saying that as we got to
                    Christmas of 1967 things were quiet politically, things were quiet
                    militarily.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Relatively speaking.</p>
                <p>Q: Robert McNamara has suggested that three years earlier, if I recall correctly,
                    three years earlier he was able to see that the American effort was not likely
                    to work and he feels a great deal of contrition that he continued to work with
                    it. Does that make sense to you? By the time we were in 1967, what kind of a
                    prediction could one have made? By 1967?</p>
                <p>MARSH: The highest level statements in the latter part of '67 were very
                    encouraging. Statements from the senior military were highly encouraging and
                    what they were misreading was a lessening or absence of enemy military activity
                    and taking that as a sign of constructive progress. That we had sufficiently
                    staffed and armed the Vietnamese forces and established hamlet security and
                    undertaken economic and social programs that were taking root and so forth and
                    so that things were getting better. There was that.</p>
                <p>Now as far as Secretary McNamara, I've read his book, too. I'm saddened by what I
                    have seen in the book because every experience that I had, and there were quite
                    a few with Secretary McNamara during his visits to Vietnam and in terms of his
                    statements in Washington and elsewhere, every such experience was that he was
                    fulfilling very actively and very eagerly the role of chief cheerleader for the
                    U.S. effort. At no time was there any suggestion that he had any misgivings or
                    any doubts about the eventual outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think he felt comfortable or sincere in his role of
                        chiecheerleader?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MARSH: You know, the so-called McNamara method applied in Vietnam. That is to say
                    the application of numerous quantifiable measures of incremental approaches in
                    terms of arming, staffing, deploying, and so forth, both the U.S. and the South
                    Vietnamese forces. We certainly had the impression at that time that what he had
                    been so famed for at the Ford Motor Company, was in full application with
                    respect to the Vietnam effort. But in terms of any strategic or shall we say
                    global findings on his part, we had no notion of those whatsoever. And, as a
                    matter of fact, the question arises then why George Ball and others, who had
                    misgivings to say the least about the course of events in Vietnam and of U.S.
                    Policy, why they were so alone. They received no support that I can tell, and
                    I've reviewed the foreign relations of the United States for '64 and '65 and
                    looked at other documents. I have never seen any time in which Secretary
                    McNamara gives the slightest indication that he was having second thoughts.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, let me ask. I think McNamara believes what he is saying in his book, but
                    do you think what he is saying in his book represents what he thought in the
                    early and mid 1960s, or do you think he's reconstructed all that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: More the latter. A friend at the time in the '60s was on the staff of
                    Senator Robert Kennedy and I was invited over to brief Senator Kennedy a number
                    of times on the progress of the war, or lack thereof, and so on. I found Senator
                    Kennedy in those times, I'm talking 1966 and 1967, I found him very gung-ho as
                    far as the military effort was concerned. He was particularly interested in what
                    the Special Forces were or were not accomplishing. Thus I was quite surprised
                    when we had the identification of Senator Kennedy with an anti-war position when
                    his candidacy for President came about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had Governor Romney, who went out to Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Who was, quote, brain washed, unquote.</p>
                <p>Q: Who at the time he was in Vietnam was extraordinarily gung-ho, and was
                    basically running around cheerleading, then when he came back said he was brain
                    washed, and I think thought he was.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Anyhow, I ask this Bill not because you know the answer, but because I think
                    it is a very fair question for students of the period and students of McNamara's
                    book. Anyhow, thank you for the insight.</p>
                <p>MARSH: I accompanied him to Hue and elsewhere in Vietnam during his visits and
                    sat in on a number of briefings scheduled for him. Suffice it to say that if he
                    had doubts, he concealed them very effectively.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Q: Bill, let me move to a slightly different direction. You were working in the
                    State Department right now, it was still the Dean Rusk period, Leonard Unger,
                    William Bundy was Assistant Secretary, and at the White House, if I remember
                    correctly, we had Walt Rostow and we had Robert Komer who had moved in.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Somewhat later.</p>
                <p>Q: Somewhat later. Well, still, back at this period can you describe a little bit
                    what the State Department's role was? Was the State Department making policy or
                    was it just answering congressional correspondence at that time? Who was making
                    policy?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, very clearly the President was making policy. You'll recall that the
                    President took a direct hand to such an extent that he even designed the then
                    new American embassy in Saigon, and went over the plans and so forth. You'll
                    recall that later he said that he was spending, in his memoirs he said that he
                    was spending during that time, 60 to 80 percent of his time on Vietnam.
                    Secretary McNamara later said that he was spending about 80 percent of his time
                    on Vietnam. So the obsession with this small country, and it was that, but as
                    McNamara knew full well and as Lyndon Johnson said many times before, the United
                    States had never lost a war. Moreover, as leader of the free world and the only
                    super power - now we know it was the only super power but then it was the only
                    super power on the side of liberty in the world - it was the bulwark against
                    Russian and Chinese expansionism in the world. The bulwark against subversion
                    and destruction of friendly regimes everywhere what we had to do was to reverse
                    the stigma of the French defeat in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I don't know, I think that the people who expressed misgivings at that time, such
                    as George Ball and others earlier were very heavily penalized for not being part
                    of the effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Senator Kennedy you felt was a friend of the effort at
                        thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: At that time, but later disassociated himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bill, we're now sort of finished with 1967, aren't we?</p>
                <p>MARSH: We are, and then we entered the most difficult year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The most difficult year...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>MARSH: Because certainly the military had not prepared us for the Tet Offensive,
                    which was after all a magnificently concealed effort by the Vietcong and North
                    Vietnamese of country-wide mass organization and preparation. You had to admire
                    them. Their timing, the force of their attack, all of that, were extraordinary.
                    Now, I liken sometimes 1968 to roughly, for the United States, to roughly
                    1958-59 for the French in Algeria when we won militarily as the French did and
                    lost politically and psychologically.</p>
                <p>Now in preparation for the coming elections, back to '67 for a moment, the
                    President insisted that persons knowledgeable about Vietnam go out on speaking
                    tours as frequently as possible. So those of us on the Vietnam Working Group
                    were very often out doing that. An example of this was when in '66, on the way
                    to Washington, my wife and I visited her parents in Oklahoma and the Governor,
                    later Senator, Henry Bellman became aware that I was there. He was driven up
                    from Oklahoma City, 135 miles, to have breakfast with me at some ungodly hour
                    like 6:30 or 7:00 in the morning, it was still dark, I remember. There were
                    automobiles with state troopers and everything else, and there I am sitting with
                    the Governor of Oklahoma in a diner, for heaven's sake, having breakfast to
                    brief him on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, what was his motivation to drive 135 miles to see
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Every public official, of course, who had political aspirations, wanted to
                    try to get the facts to find out about Vietnam. Now, fewer and fewer,
                    particularly those of the other party were visiting Vietnam because they didn't
                    want to be associated or tainted with that, which was the difference. Even so,
                    we were in the briefing paper publishing business in the Vietnam Working Group.
                    There was always somebody going away on a trip and we were doing these briefing
                    papers, or going to Europe in connection with the effort to seek negotiations
                    and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Of course in those days, prior to the Wang, prior to word processors and all that
                    sort of thing this was all virtually handwritten work that was then typed by the
                    tireless Barbara White on her little typewriter. I cannot express fully my
                    admiration for her. She was just extraordinary and grinding it all out.</p>
                <p>It's interesting that we had two political officers on the Vietnam Working Group,
                    something that was such an enormous part of the President's agenda. And at that
                    time you generally had two political officers for other countries of some
                    significance, of course, not for the smallest ones. So we had about the same
                    staffing there for Vietnam as there was for Italy or Belgium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. Bill, 1968, Tet Offensive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MARSH: The onslaught.</p>
                <p>Q: The onslaught. What was your role in that? Could you describe what you and the
                    Working Group actually did, because the Tet Offensive, the outlines of it are
                    fairly well known?</p>
                <p>MARSH: The Tet Offensive tended to pass overhead because we now had the full
                    attention of the principals and the seniors. The embassy was dealing directly
                    with them. The military were dealing directly with the Joint Chiefs who were
                    dealing directly with the White House, that kind of thing. We were at a
                    decidedly lower level at that time. But we were considering the options, as a
                    matter of fact.</p>
                <p>We were considering options when we did not know what was going to come. And of
                    course the Public Affairs side of the house was a total disaster. You'll
                    remember General Loan executing the Vietcong in Cho Lon on television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General Kau, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Loan, Loan. I believe it was General Loan, if I'm nomistaken. Okay,
                    General Kau, if that is who it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whoever it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I'm not sure, but the chief of security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We all remember the photograph.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And a bound Vietcong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a prize-winning photograph.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, etc. The overrunning of the embassy, and poor Hue, where some 3,000
                    notables of the town were done in by the Vietcong, really an eradication of the
                    anti-communist infrastructure in the place. It was just an unmitigated disaster.
                    Meanwhile, we were running around the country trying to speak on it and this had
                    some very interesting developments.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I tended to take some of the farthest speaking engagements for the simple reason
                    that I was still exhausted from the whole work and wanted to get away from the
                    office, get a decent night's sleep. So I would take Texas and California. My
                    parents at that time lived in California, so it was a chance to see them. I am
                    an only child and it was a good chance and sometimes I would take my
                    two-year-old son with me.</p>
                <p>I remember one time at the University of Wyoming where I was speaking and they
                    refused to help me at all. I had this two-year-old and they wouldn't find a
                    babysitter for me to pay, so I spoke and he was on the stage, sitting on the
                    stage behind me. Basic decencies were not observed. It was really
                    outrageous.</p>
                <p>Then I went to a small Presbyterian college in North Texas one time, thinking
                    that this was a state with a strong military tradition, here I'll be on friendly
                    ground. I come to find this huge banner on the chapel saying 'Go Home, Marsh,
                    You War Criminal.' It was a time of insurgency in the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: When your two-year-old son was sharing the platform with you, did you think
                    your lack of better care from your hosts was politically motivated?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They refused to tell me where I was to speak, they just said it was in
                    something or other hall. I said, well, where was that, please, and they just
                    said to find out for myself. There was calculated rudeness, nastiness
                    throughout.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this before or after the famous episode where McNamara went to the
                    University of California, I believe at Berkeley, and was shouted down and had to
                    leave before he could say anything?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I believe it was after. I spoke at Scripps College, which is nearby, and a
                    whole contingent came down from Berkeley to shout me down there.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, when the Tet Offensive happened, shortly afterwards, I remember for
                    example Robert Komer, this is anecdotal information, but I remember that Robert
                    Komer was barely able to speak coherently and indeed was giggling, most of the
                    time, because he was so nervous. He had flown there and he had flown back
                    afterwards, and he was so nervous that he was kept away from the press. My
                    question is, in your observation, how were responsible officials in America,
                    people who were responsible for the policy, how were they taking all this
                    psychologically, the Tet Offensive? Was it a big, palpable downer for
                    everyone?</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MARSH: It varied. We had some people who were so much a part of the program that
                    they were just impervious to what the reactions were from outside. I got into a
                    lot of trouble, you know, because I came back and reported in the spring of '68
                    that people were terribly upset about the war. That there was a great deal of
                    upheaval out there, and that matters were going to be very, very difficult and
                    particularly I had heard that there were plans to disrupt the Democratic
                    Convention in Chicago. I did this in a memo and I got a rebuke and was told that
                    I was exaggerating, that others had said that the self-sacrifice of President
                    Johnson in declining to seek a second term in office had calmed the public.</p>
                <p>You'll recall that in the Efficiency Reports in those days there was the part
                    that we did not see and in the part that I did not see there was a pretty
                    strident criticism of me. I was called an alarmist and all that sort of thing
                    and that my reporting was not remarkable for its accuracy and all that sort of
                    thing. Then I was also told verbally to understand that the Democratic
                    Convention in Chicago was in no danger whatsoever and that Mayor Daley of
                    Chicago had all arrangements well in hand.</p>
                <p>A few years later, by the way, just to finish the story on that one, an Inspector
                    happened across me in Brussels. He told me about the Secret part of that 1968
                    report and he took steps to issue a rebuttal and to have that put into the file.
                    I'm very grateful to Ambassador Parsons for that.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I like that. Let me ask another thing. A lot of things happened in 1968.
                    There was a Tet Offensive, there was a My Lai massacre, there was a battle of
                    Khe Sanh, there were U.S. protests, very strong ones, and then at some point
                    that year, if I remember, the Pentagon Papers appeared. Or am I getting ahead of
                    myself?</p>
                <p>MARSH: It was afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was afterwards. All right, then let's skip over
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The public attitude was such that it was obvious that the post-war
                    consensus on foreign policy had now disintegrated. There was also an attitude in
                    the public of 'do not bother me with the facts.' I want to give two examples of
                    that for any scholars who may be listening.</p>
                <p>I debated one time Professor Sidney Peck of Western Reserve University. Professor
                    Peck went on and on how in 1967 if the Vietnamese had not voted the government
                    ticket, their rice ration cards would not have been stamped. Therefore they
                    would have been cut out of the food chain, as it were. In rebuttal I said that
                    this was very interesting, but that there was just one problem with it, there
                    weren't any rice rationing cards in Vietnam. This didn't stop Professor Peck, he
                    continued on the same story and with the same thing!</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Then there was another thing. There was a young man down from Berkeley who spoke
                    at Scripps to me. He was actually rather decent. He said that he appreciated
                    that I had my views and so forth, but on the other hand perhaps my experiences
                    had colored my attitudes. Therefore perhaps people who had never been to Vietnam
                    had a better understanding of what was going on there than those who had been
                    part of it. I said to him that this was an amazing position for a student to
                    take because it seemed to me a total eradication of the scientific method.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, we are in the year 1968, after the Tet Offensive.
                        What weryou folks doing at that time? What is next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was, to borrow a phrase from Queen Elizabeth II, that was the annus
                    horribilis for the Vietnam effort, I think. In the first place, the wounded
                    lion, Lyndon Johnson, was besieged on all sides. The strange thing is he
                    probably would have been re-elected we see now, but in any event he felt he had
                    no choice to do that. Of course he only lived four years after leaving the White
                    House.</p>
                <p>The efforts in Vietnam seemed more out of control than ever before. An example
                    was the famous Lieutenant Colonel who in the town in the Delta, Ben Tre, which I
                    believe you know, Vlad, said the immortal words, “It was necessary to destroy it
                    in order to save it.” And back in Washington I groaned when I read that report
                    and said “this fatuity is going to plague us” and I was chewed out. I was
                    condemned on that. I'm not smirking when I say now that that still haunts us. It
                    became a kind of a watchword, a slogan, a model of those critical of the U.S.
                    effort in Vietnam. But I got in trouble. Why? Because there was a desperate
                    attempt to rally all the forces in Washington in support of the President, in
                    support of the military and in support of what came to be called as CORDS, which
                    was the newest name for a pacification effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these were in particular the civilians who were going
                        out ia pacification effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. It was extraordinary to me because I had had some experience in state
                    and local government working for a foundation for three years, three and a half
                    years, in Pittsburgh. I knew a little something about the mentalities and the
                    capabilities and the problems of local government. But here we were relying for
                    that work on technical expertise and the people who went out seemed to me
                    political virgins who knew nothing at all about what it was to try to win
                    friends and influence people at local and regional levels. But it went on and on
                    and on.</p>
                <p>The decision of the President not to stand for re-election, and the criticism
                    that came, and the debate in the 1968 political campaigns... remember that until
                    his unfortunate assassination Senator Kennedy was a very strong critic of the
                    war and he was an insider.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, when did Senator Kennedy switch from being with that
                        particular program to being against that particular program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I tried to look that up and document that and it's difficult, but I would
                    say that it was some time during 1967, with more intense opposition to the war
                    after the Tet Offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But in any event, Washington, it seemed to me, was in a state of
                    disorganization at that time. The thrust now was really, at least as far as
                    State was concerned, was really on launching negotiations and making something
                    of them and the question of the war was picked up by others. Again, State is
                    having a very difficult time coping with the public uproar within the United
                    States. It does not know how to deal with it.</p>
                <p>It's interesting. In those days we had far more invitations to come and speak or
                    debate or something of that sort, with all expenses paid, than we could deal
                    with. Today there are very, very few indeed. But I would say that I was out a
                    hundred times in the territory between Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and
                    California and Nevada in the course of about a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very impressive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was interesting because you went to school in Massachusetts and in
                    Worcester one time a woman really accused me of practicing witchcraft, which she
                    intended as a left-handed compliment to my fluidity and verbosity in defense of
                    the war. But I thought I was back in Salem in 1692.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, we are moving ahead in '68. When that year ended
                        wherwere we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, my trials and tribulations were to end in June of 1968 because I had
                    decided on a switch in region. Now my foreign, overseas experience between 1953
                    and 1968, not continuously of course but on and off had been exclusively in the
                    Far East. And for family and personal reasons and so forth I had decided to
                    shift into a different geographical region. I spoke with the training people and
                    was to undertake a course called Atlantic Affairs Training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, may I just butt in for a minute? In mid 1968 did
                        yoactually leave the Vietnam business forever?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>MARSH: I left the Vietnam business for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For four years, until 1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Maybe for the purposes of continuity here
                        perhaps thwisest thing to do would be to just stay with the Vietnam
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>Q: You left it in 1968 at a period when there was a lot of gloom and disarray and
                    a lot of repercussions within America, a very tense period. And then you went
                    and you basically went to Brussels, as I remember. But that's another tale.</p>
                <p>MARSH: That's another tale told elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Brussels, did you come right back to
                        Washington anto Vietnam, did you come home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No. But there is one thing I'd like to relate, with your permission, is
                    that this Atlantic Affairs Training, for some ungodly reason, the Department
                    decided that Berkeley was the place I should go to do that. I sent in a couple
                    of applications to the University, and they claimed they never received them. I
                    finally received an anonymous telephone call from somebody saying, “Mr. Marsh
                    don't send any more applications in because we're going to destroy them. We
                    don't want war criminals here at the University of California.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an amazing story! That was a call from the
                        University oCalifornia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>MARSH: So I of course immediately said, “Ah hah, so we have McCarthyism of the
                    Left, have we?” Yes, the person thought he was being helpful, it was a man, but
                    he never revealed his name. He refused to reveal his name. So I did not go to
                    Berkeley, which I didn't want to do anyway, frankly, I went to Brussels instead.
                    Now Vietnam and Southeast Asia were a great tar baby. I went on leave. Having
                    left at the end of June 1968 from the desk, I went on leave. While on leave I
                    got a call, and you understand I had left the Vietnam Working Group and was
                    really in transient status. I got a call that I should go to Honolulu for the
                    state visit of President Thieu. His state visit to the United States had a
                    rather brief itinerary. It was Honolulu, period. He didn't dare go to the U.S.
                    mainland.</p>
                <p>So I went up there and helped out. President Johnson came in and spent about two
                    and a half to three hours with President Thieu and then immediately leaped on
                    his plane. There was no state dinner, there was no anything. I was just supposed
                    to try to keep the Vietnamese happy. But I was called back, as it were, to go
                    out there.</p>
                <p>While in Brussels I was approached to become political counselor in Phnom Penh. I
                    managed to shake that off on the grounds I had two small children, although the
                    ambassador embarrassed the devil out of me by telling me that so had he.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Manfull?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, no. The ambassador in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador in Cambodia at that time? Not Mr.
                        Dean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, he was the grand finale, it was before that time. In any event in '72
                    it looked as if I would be going back to the Bureau of European Affairs, and I
                    really didn't feel like doing that. I hit upon the idea of trying to get on the
                    Vietnam Delegation in Paris, and that worked. I went down and was there in '72.
                    I happened to arrive at the time of the revival of the public talks, which had
                    been suspended since the North Vietnamese offensive in April.</p>
                <p>My job, I succeeded Jim Rosenthal there, once again, and my job was to be the
                    senior political officer there. Translation: I wrote presentations made in the
                    weekly meetings. Well, I wasn't there very long before it came out, it was
                    revealed, as part of course of the 1972 presidential strategy, that Dr.
                    Kissinger had had private talks with the North Vietnamese and that these were
                    going to be renewed. So I then worked...the schizophrenia of the situation was
                    incredible, you know, these sterile public weekly talks and then the really
                    substantive talks done separately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: We're talking about June of '72, I think it was, June or Julof '72.</p>
                <p>Q: Things moved very quickly in the negotiation. Were you folks in the second
                    half of 1972 were you doing the real negotiations or were you still doing the
                    unreal negotiations?</p>
                <p>MARSH: We increasingly were doing the real negotiations and we wercontinuing the
                    unreal negotiations. That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember it was Phil Habib earlier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was Phil Habib earlier. I can't think of his name. Iwas Ambassador
                    William something who later became ambassador to Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I can't remember his name either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I can't think of his name, but anyway Heyward Isham was the deputy chief
                    of mission and the man with whom I dealt the most because the ambassador tended
                    to stay in his residence and communicate by radio with Dr. Kissinger. So he was
                    privy to practically everything and the rest of us were never quite sure how
                    much we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the Vietnamese at that time that you were dealing
                        with,anyone that was memorable?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, of course, Dr. Kissinger was seeing Le Duc Tho. And there were some
                    very funny aspects of that. One time when there was to be a special meeting
                    between the North Vietnamese and the U.S., and somehow Madame Binh, head of the
                    Vietcong Delegation, which was known as the Provisional Revolutionary Government
                    of South Vietnam, you'll recall, but let's say Vietcong, got wind of it. She
                    showed up and when she showed up we, of course, wanted to notify the South
                    Vietnamese to show up as well...our friends. The North Vietnamese said don't
                    bother to call the South Vietnamese because they were not going to talk if Binh
                    were there. They were treating her as a complete and total non-entity in fact,
                    but of course publicly using her as an emblem of South Vietnamese integrity and
                    independence and so forth. It was very interesting that they would admit to us
                    that they were doing that. But by that time they were getting pretty frank.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, by late January of 1973 we had a peace agreement. Now let me just ask,
                    when you were working in Paris in the second half of 1972, did you feel that
                    there was progress toward a peace agreement, did you feel that there were good
                    grounds to have a peace agreement? What was your assessment at that time?</p>
                <p>MARSH: It seemed that there was genuine progress underway. We were not privy to
                    all of the details, particularly military details and so forth and so on. I do
                    recall that in October Dr. Kissinger announced that peace was at hand. The
                    sticking point, of course, was Saigon and the Thieu government was not about to
                    subscribe to its own demise, which is what it saw in the offing. So then the
                    North Vietnamese began to intensify their demands and the Christmas bombing was
                    unquestionably, in my mind and in the mind of the others there, the primary
                    cause of the North Vietnamese readiness to resume negotiations in a genuine
                    sense.</p>
                <p>Q: Is it correct to say also that the Christmas bombing of 1972 was basically an
                    unwritten footnote to the peace agreement saying, “We'll do this to you again?”
                    Wasn't it supposed to be a show of strength that would make sense out of almost
                    any agreement that might be signed afterwards?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, possibly...possibly. I don't think there was anything that was
                    expressly sensed about that sort of thing, but then later Congressional actions
                    in which we were declining to provide additional help to the South Vietnamese
                    and that sort of thing ruled that out. The North Vietnamese then felt they had
                    nothing to fear.</p>
                <p>The North Vietnamese delegation returned to Hanoi after the break off of talks in
                    December and the Christmas bombing began. They had just left their plane and
                    were moving into the terminal when a bomb fell on the plane and demolished it.
                    It is said that had a strong psychological impact upon the North Vietnamese
                    negotiators. But in any event a few days later, yes, we had peace.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peace was around January 23 of 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, that's so, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, what did you think of that agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You know, that was 1973. My interrelationship, if we want to call it that,
                    with Vietnam had started eleven years before. We had to keep up our hopes over
                    the years. In spite of everything we had to keep up our self-confidence and our
                    hopes. We had to believe in the efficacy and the integrity of international
                    agreements, particularly when we had had them seconded by the Secretary General
                    of the United Nations and a special international conference that you'll recall
                    was held in Paris at our urging. That was all part of the arrangement. We
                    thought we had solemnized and formalized everything that we needed to do with
                    respect to that.</p>
                <p>We also did not realize to what an extent the Thieu regime was a wild card. Once
                    again we were overestimating the capacity of a friendly government to look out
                    for itself and to deal with its problems and all that kind of thing. You know
                    panic set in in 1975 in the Central Highlands. There was no way to predict that
                    that was going to happen. But in any event we had hopes, and of course we had
                    special negotiations which received zero publicity and which I worked on for
                    four or five months which were the economic aid negotiations with North Vietnam.
                    I was the only State person sitting in on that.</p>
                <p>Q: Right, right. Bill, we had at that time a publicized rift between Henry
                    Kissinger and a bright, junior member of his operation, John Negroponte. And at
                    that time the story that came out was that John Negroponte thought we were
                    concluding a bad agreement, we were operating from weakness. What do you make of
                    that story, do you have any insights on that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I have talked with John about that. At the time we didn't know a great
                    deal about it. But of course Dr. Kissinger, who was always under enormous
                    pressure, had an agenda the likes of which few if any American diplomatic
                    statesmen have ever had. He would flare up from time to time. I remember when a
                    certain individual did not accept an assignment, or questioned an assignment,
                    the Secretary became very angry. He directed that his promotion be held up and
                    so forth. This didn't last all that long and ultimately...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ultimately he didn't go to Bordeaux, but he went somewhere

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You know about that?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a friend of ours called Mr. Djerejian.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, and you know how Mr. Djerejian rose even during thKissinger
                    years.</p>
                <p>Q: I would not mention names if Djerejian or Negroponte were it not now more than
                    25 years ago. I'm very relaxed. Bill, you've got to remember, this was over 25
                    years ago.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Thanks for the reminder.</p>
                <p>Q: It's amazing. Very soon it will be 25 years to the day that we had the Peace
                    Accords and it is going to be 30 years very soon, in a few weeks, from the Tet
                    Offensive.</p>
                <p>MARSH: You're doing nothing for my morale! In any event there were these sorts of
                    things. Secretary Kissinger, he wasn't Secretary of State yet, but at any rate
                    he was under great tension and he had to get things out of his system, I think,
                    as we all do from time to time. Incidentally everybody who worked with him
                    marveled at his creativity and his ability to interrelate all sort of seemingly
                    disparate sorts of things. This is an incredible mind it was a joy to be around.
                    It seemed to us a genius kind of mind. What occurred to us time and time again
                    and I heard it many times was “why didn't I think of that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating, Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: What I'm trying to suggest was it wasn't necessarily the most intricate or
                    the most involved or erudite kind of thing that he would come up with. It might
                    be a very simple approach to a problem that made great sense and we were just
                    off on the wrong branch line with respect to it. So it was very exciting being
                    there with him.</p>
                <p>He and I on personal terms got along very well because I was coming to the
                    conclusion that at, what, 42, 43 years of age, that I probably ought to be
                    looking elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elsewhere than the State Department or elsewhere than the
                        Vietnabusiness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Elsewhere than the State Department. So I was very forthright, verging on
                    the brash with him, and he appreciated that. I remember one time when Dr.
                    Kissinger had what I regard as a supercilious and intemperate remark about the
                    church to which I happen to belong. I told him I didn't appreciate that at all
                    and he was the last person I would expect to hear something about religious
                    intolerance from and he backed away. In later years, when I was back in the
                    Department, we got along very well together. I have spoken with him at length.
                    The last time was three years ago. We had a very good time. I have the highest
                    respect and regard for him.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>To make a probably fairly silly metaphor but in any event, when the ship is
                    sinking, and you think you may have buoyed it up a bit and maybe salvaged this
                    or that, you are not going to worry about details. At that point we simply could
                    not do that. Now whether there was really an effort, a genuine effort, and a
                    real prospect of dealing with the North Vietnamese on the three and a quarter
                    billion dollar five-year program that had been promised them, I really don't
                    know. That may have just been a lure in the fishing sense of the word. In any
                    event we did negotiate seriously with them and they went greedily and happily
                    through order books looking at locomotives and farm machinery and this and that
                    and the other kind of thing. Like children at Christmas making up their lists of
                    what they wanted and so forth and so on. Then of course this was all called off
                    in the summer of '73.</p>

                    didn't want to hear very much about Vietnam again. Thank you very much but they
                    wanted it not on the back burner; they wanted it put in the cupboard, out of
                    sight and out of mind because it was too unpleasant.</p>

                    '67, early '68, could not be more marked because I had almost nothing to do.</p>

                    curtailed. Can you believe that? Because I was in Paris and I had nothing to do.
                    Gee. Isn't that terrible!</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But, you know, professionally I think that I'm sort of like beer. If I'm
                    not under pressure, I go flat. And there was no pressure at all. There was one
                    thing, I had to send in a weekly telegram from Paris and that was on the talks
                    between the North and South Vietnamese, which were nothing talks, of course.</p>
                <p>Q: I suspect that the last place that either side is going to go, certainly the
                    Vietnamese side, the last place the Communists were going to go, if they were up
                    to something that violated the Accords, would be to go to Paris to talk about
                    it. It was not something they wanted to do.</p>
                <p>MARSH: No, but Secretary Kissinger did meet with the North Vietnamese in December
                    of 1973, so I had a few days of frenzy then. My in-laws were coming over for
                    Christmas and we were going to take a trip. Fortunately I managed to pack him up
                    and get him off just in time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask, Bill, are we nearing the end of the Vietnam
                        part othis story or is there another chapter that comes ahead of us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: There is a postscript.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we could get to the postscript.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The postscript is very sad. It's the month of April 1975. Phil Habib, the
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs, pulled me in to work on the Indo-China
                    Task Force that was created to deal with the collapse. I worked on that. It was
                    very interesting because the pulse and the drive of that were as nothing
                    compared with a few years previously. It was a sideshow by that time. And of
                    course the ending was tragic and everyone knew that it was going to be tragic.
                    But I had to do a daily...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had you been before Phil pulled you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>MARSH: I was deputy director of Western European Affairs and FrencCountry
                    director.</p>
                <p>Q: I see. I was working on the NATO desk at that time and I remember, it wasn't
                    Phil who pulled me in, it was on a friendly basis, a late night call from Frank
                    Wisner, who simply asked me to come and work with him and I said “of
                    course.”</p>
                <p>MARSH: So it was temporary duty. Incidentally this mysterious check arrived
                    afterwards and, you know you're afraid to take anything from the Department to
                    which you were not 100 percent clearly entitled. So I called them up and said
                    I'd gotten this check and there was a mistake, I didn't know what I had gotten
                    this check. They said it was for my overtime. I said they don't pay people of my
                    rank overtime and they said to shut up, that Under Secretary Habib has taken
                    care of this. So finally I got some overtime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was the last chapter, professionally
                        speaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, it was. By the way, while even in Brussels I had quite a lot to do
                    with the League of Families concerning the MIAs, which was heart rending. There
                    was a couple whose son was an MIA. They lived in Brussels at that time. She was
                    an officer of the League so I had more than I ever would have dreamed to do with
                    it. One was never very far from it all during those years. Never very far from
                    it.</p>
                <p>In 1975, with the collapse of Saigon, a number of members of the old South
                    Vietnamese delegation in Paris wanted to come, they asked if they could come to
                    live with us in Washington and all that sort of thing. It was a very difficult
                    period indeed. I would say there were four members of that delegation that
                    wanted to bring their families and come live with us temporarily. Just couldn't
                    deal with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were boat people that wanted to come out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: A little later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little later. There were refugees beginning to show up

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, but these were people who had been overseas, stayeoverseas, and had
                    no Vietnam to go back to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if they were overseas when it happened had no claim to

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>MARSH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had friends like that and my advice to them was not to
                        comillegally to America. They all could.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I gave the same advice.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I had telephone calls from Paris, from Athens, from what not and so forth.
                    Some of them were former South Vietnamese diplomats assigned to embassies
                    there.</p>
                <p>Q: In these conversations we've dealt with a large extent on American policy and
                    yet you speak very good Vietnamese and I believe you had a number of people you
                    knew well over there. Have you been in touch at all, what's happened to the
                    people you knew the best when you were in Vietnam?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I don't know. I have not been in touch. No, I have not maintained contact.
                    My wife was not well treated in Bangkok and I remember when our second child was
                    born, was born in Washington, in the recovery room she kept asking if it were
                    Bangkok. Her subconscious came to the fore on that. I had to assure her no, it
                    was not. So I decided I would not put her through that again. But she's no sissy
                    because actually we went to Saudi Arabia at the end of the '70s and she loved
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, I think if we are at the end of the Vietnam chapters

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It is time to take the pause. We might then, if you wish, go into lessons
                    learned a little bit, something of that sort but perhaps we've passed those
                    along as we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's leave that option open. I'd be delighted to do

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Nick Heyniger and Bill Marsh. We are in the period
                        196to 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We were talking about different perceptions of the situation and thfuture in
                    Vietnam within the ranks of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Nick, I have never seen this written out, but it is something that I've
                    been thinking about over the years and came up with rather diametrically opposed
                    approaches to policy making. It seems to me that the Foreign Service tends to
                    regard policy making as an inductive process. That is to say, through empirical
                    evidence and experience you put together all the factors, the assets, the
                    liabilities and so forth and so on and you devise a policy. Whereas it seems to
                    me that our betters and seniors have a deductive approach to it and that this
                    was no where better demonstrated than in Vietnam. Apart from the tactical
                    situation, there was really an appalling lack of knowledge and understanding at
                    senior levels about Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The only thing that mattered was Deus le Veult, as the Pope said in launching the
                    Crusades, “God wills it,” only in this case it wasn't God, it was the President
                    of the United States, and we were going to win and we would work out later what
                    winning meant. The basic problem that we had was that we could never prove a
                    negative, and therefore we could never know whether we were winning or not. What
                    do I mean by that? Well, the whole idea was that South Vietnam should not fall
                    to Communist domination from the North. Well, how do you prove that? And nobody
                    had the faintest idea and still doesn't on the thing, or even if it is
                    provable.</p>
                <p>Q: I guess the military would have said if warlike activity ceases or declines
                    significantly and in effect South Vietnam has become pacified we would have
                    won.</p>
                <p>MARSH: We fell in that trap in 1967, late 1967. There was a long period of quiet,
                    but the mere absence of conflict is certainly not a peace or a victory. The
                    Vietcong and North Vietnamese preparing to launch the Tet Offensive occasioned
                    that quiet in late 1967.</p>
                <p>The shock of the Tet Offensive was the contrast between the relative lack of
                    hostilities in late 1967 and the storm, the tempest that broke out, in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's pursue that for a minute. What would you say
                        was theffect of the Tet Offensive within the halls of the Department of
                        State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>MARSH: Within the halls of the Department of State there was a mixture of chagrin
                    and hopefulness, perhaps. Because the overrunning of the embassy in Saigon, for
                    example, the overrunning of major parts of Saigon and all of the major cities
                    elsewhere in the country was after the enormous sacrifices we had already made.
                    And having more than a half million troops in the country, at that time, and
                    having spent heaven knows how many billions of dollars, the shock was a very
                    great one, but still there was a hopefulness in that. It was not a military
                    success for the enemy side. The Vietcong were decimated and never, as a matter
                    of fact, came back in numbers and in strengths and in the drive that they had
                    prior to Tet.</p>
                <p>But of course for the United States it was an unmitigated politicadisaster.</p>
                <p>Q: But what I'm probing for is you and your job and your knowledge of the
                    Department after the Tet Offensive. Where was Hilsman at this time, for example?
                    Were there people who said maybe we ought to rethink this situation?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, clearly, yes, and you can see that in the archives of the Foreign
                    Relations of the United States. For example, George Ball was an advocate of a
                    compromise solution. But remember the general optic was that of 1938. Munich was
                    again and again and again mentioned, and particularly by the Secretary of State,
                    as the raison d'�tre for the great effort there. That we had failed to heed the
                    signals and for that we paid dearly and we must not do so again. There was also
                    the spreading effect, the domino effect, to use President Eisenhower's phrase
                    for it. And there was also a dread on the part of policy makers. They would not
                    be associated with the first time the United States had lost a war.</p>
                <p>You know in that sense they probably had some foresight because here, 22 years
                    after the fall of Saigon, Vietnam remains the national trauma. It has a daily
                    influence on what we do and why we do it and more particularly why we don't do a
                    great many things. But in any event in '67 President Johnson decides, with the
                    election coming up, that he wants people out on the hustings as frequently as
                    possible. They are to hold meetings, explain U.S. policy, and try to clear up
                    the rising tide of discontent and dissent and quasi-revolution in the country.
                    So yours truly and others in the group were sent out very frequently.</p>
                <p>Now in those days we could pick and choose, because there were so many
                    invitations all expenses paid for groups all over the country for someone to
                    come out and speak on Vietnam. So I looked upon that as a chance to get some
                    sleep, after a terrible year and a third, year and a quarter, whatever it was. I
                    could catch up a bit because I could sleep on a plane, get to bed fairly early
                    the night before you had to speaprovided you went far enough. Now there were
                    some people who went to West Virginia and Massachusetts. They could be back the
                    same day. Yours truly went out to the West Coast because, first of all his
                    parents lived in Los Angeles at that time, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>But in any event this was really very exciting. Why? Well, I remember going to a
                    small Protestant college in North Texas where I was to speak at the chapel. Here
                    is a big banner all across the front of the chapel when I arrived that said “Go
                    Home, Marsh, you war criminal.” Then I went out to Scripps College in California
                    and had a complete contingent of rather Left Wing students come down from
                    Berkeley in order to boo and hiss and harass and everything else as I tried to
                    talk to the ladies of Scripps College. I had all these men from Berkeley down
                    there giving me a hard time. It was quite extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, one of the things I remember so well. I did speak in Massachusetts.
                    I took my turn at the nearer ones, yes. And in Worcester, Massachusetts, a lady
                    with a wonderfully broad 'A' got up and said, “Mr. Marsh, you said you are not
                    particularly adept in public speaking. I think you are devilishly clever at
                    public speaking. As a matter of fact, I think you are a representative of the
                    devil.” I saw the fires of Salem burning there, in my mind's eye.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? What was her complaint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I think that some of her ancestors had been awitchcraft trials, to
                    tell you the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the situation in Vietnam, as you
                        saw it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: After all, I'd had an awful lot of practice. I debated a good many leaders
                    of the anti war movement whose disregard of the facts was so egregious that it
                    actually helped sustain me during a period of great doubt and self-searching and
                    so forth that I experienced at that time. But what I'm saying is that the other
                    side was so unreasonable that it made our side look even better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the lady with the broad 'A' from Massachusetts, what
                        shwanted us to do was get out of Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes, and I went to a Quaker meeting in North Carolina and they handed
                    me pieces of an U.S. airplane that had been shot down over Hanoi. It was
                    extreme. It was a very, very tough time. Fortunately I did not go to Chicago.
                    There was no reason that I should. I didn't happen to be at the Chicago
                    Convention but about that time came the culmination of a very interesting
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Oh, there is one more anecdote I must share with you. You'll remember that in the
                    latter days of 1967, President Johnson thought the war was being won. We were
                    going to quote “nail that coonskin to the wall” unquote, as he put it so many
                    times. So he decided he was going to visit quote “his” unquote troops in Vietnam
                    in December of 1967. He would then go and call upon the Pope and talk with him
                    about the prospects for world peace and his desire to seek a negotiated solution
                    and then return to the United States. Well, I'm sure that there were political
                    aspects to this whole thing.</p>
                <p>But I remember a series of meetings in the Department to plan the trip and an
                    aide from the White House came over, very Texan. An accent you could fry for
                    breakfast. The President wanted to see the Pope in Rome, period, and didn't want
                    to see anybody else. I'm looking around and the people from the Bureau of
                    European Affairs don't have a thing to say. So, you know, I'm half Welsh and the
                    Welsh are famous for their big mouths, and so I say, “Wait a minute, not even
                    our ally, the Prime Minister of Italy?” No, the boss doesn't want to see him.
                    That's very strange. All these other people are very quiet.</p>
                <p>I'm in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, for crying out loud, but
                    still foreign policy is a seamless web, as far as I'm concerned. So I said
                    they'd better change that as it would be a bad thing, it would harmful to NATO,
                    it would hurt this and that and the other sort of thing. Well, he talked to LBJ
                    about it. We had another meeting and the fellow came back and said no, the
                    President wants to get off his airplane once he arrives in Italy and he wants to
                    get into a helicopter and he wants to helicopter directly into the Vatican.</p>
                <p>At that time the Holy See did not have a helipad and we pointed our that this was
                    the case. That all there was was this big square there. I looked around and the
                    people from European Affairs are keeping their mouths shut. Those from Public
                    Affairs are keeping their mouths shut and all the rest. So little William sticks
                    up his hand again and says, “But, Sir, there is this obelisk, this sort of a
                    monument that stands tall in the middle of St. Peter's Square.” He says he'll
                    talk to the boss about that. So we have a meeting the next day and this guy from
                    the White House is back and says, “Well, I talked to the boss and he says to
                    have it taken down.”Q: I can't believe it!</p>
                <p>MARSH: I had to suppress a tendency to laugh hysterically at this point. But the
                    better angels of our nature came to my defense and helped me out and I said,
                    “Oh, but Sir, that is an ancient monument and if anything should happen the
                    Catholic population of the United States would be extremely upset.”</p>
                <p>“I'll tell the boss,” he says. Back he goes and next he says, “Okay,the President
                    will take a limo. But he won't see the Italians.”</p>
                <p>Well, ultimately he did, for a matter of five or 10 minutes in thcar, no
                    less.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Q: Did you ask any of your colleagues from the European Bureau, you know, don't
                    you think it is politic for the President to pay a courtesy call on the head of
                    state of Italy while he's there? What did they say?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Nick, I don't know. But it wasn't the first and it wasn't the last time
                    that my colleagues decided that what was politic was to protect their own
                    careers. I don't know a lot of instances of overt courage. I know a lot of
                    instances of sort of covert courage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're there to provide advice to the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It seems to me if it is to be a dialogue, then it is to be a dialogue of
                    equals. But perhaps I was wrong. In any event, we did not take down Cleopatra's
                    needle. The President was not impaled on the thing as he attempted to land in
                    the helicopter. He did, and I am not kidding, pull the Italian Prime Minister
                    into his limousine, speed off and dump unceremoniously, the Prime Minister a few
                    moments later. But he did talk with the Italian Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>So, there are ways to get things done. You have to compromise little bit.</p>
                <p>Q: I want to take you back to sort of the way the State Department operated at
                    that time. Obviously from what you are saying there was not a lot of discussion
                    within the State Department about policy toward Vietnam. I just wanted to ask,
                    those of us who have been fortunate enough to be desk officers, for example the
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Resource often provides a helpful role in offering a
                    dissenting opinion about future policy, as does the Policy Planning Council. I
                    wonder, while you were on the desk, did that happen? Did INR or the Policy
                    Planning Council get involved in Vietnam policy?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Two things. First of all, you may have heard of Paul Kattenburg, who was
                    the Director of Vietnam Affairs in the bureau in 1962-63. He warned that we had
                    a very vulnerable base on which to build a Vietnam policy as far as the country
                    itself was concerned because there was the autocracy of Ngo Dinh Diem, there
                    were the sects, the internal contradictions and a very strong enemy on the other
                    side. And Paul Kattenburg never received the recognition that he deserved and
                    deserves for great courage and farsightedness. Instead he was eased out in a
                    most undignified fashion, out of the Foreign Service, and had to seek a career
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>So there was this and other examples where people were repaid for their
                    selflessness with very arbitrary ouster. Secondly, when you only know, and that
                    rather minimally, one half of an equation and nothing about the other half, that
                    is to say North Vietnam and what was critical of course was an indication of
                    North Vietnam leaders' capabilities and intentions. And on that score we had
                    nothing.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Q: Well, I recall that Roger Hilsman was the Assistant Secretary earlier, but
                    after that INR sort of got squelched as far as Vietnam was concerned. I believe
                    that this is the time when the White House, when the President, put Ernest K.
                    Lindley on the Policy Planning Council to see that nobody on the Policy Planning
                    Council voiced strong ideas of rethinking our policy toward Southeast Asia. You
                    didn't find that you were getting that from the Policy Planning Council in any
                    event?</p>
                <p>MARSH: No, but what was I? I was an FSO-5 at that time on a scale of eight, and I
                    wasn't privy to lots of things. That's what deputy directors and office
                    directors, even well above that, were undertaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, okay. So now that's two years in Washington on the
                        Vietnadesk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. Two years that was the equivalent of eight t10 normal years
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in hours of work served!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, they are just uncounted. Let me say, for a person who was a close
                    associate and friend, Tony Lake one day asked the deputy assistant secretary if
                    the following Saturday afternoon he could have a couple two, three hours off in
                    order to see his sister, whom he had not seen in some years. And the deputy said
                    that he just couldn't tell and would let him know Saturday morning. So finally
                    Saturday, about lunchtime, the deputy told Tony that he was awfully sorry but he
                    had to stand by, he might need him. Tony did not see his sister as she passed
                    through town.</p>
                <p>Now today I think this sort of thing is unthinkable because the response from the
                    young officers in the State Department would be quite unprintable and might even
                    come from their lawyers!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so now we are in 1968 and you are due for
                        reassignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I'm due for reassignment. I'm going to spend a few moments telling you
                    about an interesting development. There was a program at that time called
                    Atlantic Affairs. That regional specialization died out a few years afterwards.
                    But anyway I thought that sounded interesting because I had done time, two years
                    in Japan in the Air Force, three plus years in Vietnam and it had been very
                    traumatic, the years of separation from my family. I was not present when my
                    first child was born in Bangkok, etc. So why not head for Europe?</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Well, there was a program that consisted of university studies in Atlantic
                    Affairs and the Department decided that I should go to that. So I looked around
                    at certain colleges and universities relatively close to Washington preferably
                    so as to avoid a move. But, no, the Department said I had gone to colleges in
                    the East, I must go to the West. I did not quite understand the logic of that,
                    but at any rate they came back with an extraordinary decision. It was that I
                    should go to the University of California at Berkeley. And I said of all places
                    where a veteran of about six years on Vietnam affairs should not go is to the
                    University of California at Berkeley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, they wouldn't hear of it. So I told my wife and she thought it was
                    an extraordinary sort of assignment, too, but she was prepared to go. We enjoyed
                    the San Francisco area and all that kind of thing. So I applied. I never heard
                    from them. So I called up and they said they didn't have my application. I
                    thought that was very strange. So I filled out another one, and sent that in. I
                    felt that with my BA and my MPA, I shouldn't have any difficulty getting into a
                    one-year program doing graduate work at the University. Well, the same thing
                    happened so I sent in yet another application. Then I got a telephone call from
                    a person who refused to admit his name, to give me his name...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Inside the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Inside the University of California...saying to please not send any
                    applications because they just ball them up and throw them into the wastebasket,
                    you see, they didn't want any war criminals there, at the University of
                    California!</p>
                <p>So I decided, all right, the devil with that, and went down to the Training
                    Division in State and said this was what happened and so I suggested the School
                    of Advanced International Studies. They thought that was fine and so I applied
                    and was accepted and went to a little sort of special course they ran at FSI at
                    that time. It was called “How to Go to University Studies.” I'm not sure for
                    whom that was ever intended but in any event it was pretty rudimentary and so
                    on. And then I found out by accident something deliberate had taken place,
                    namely I had actually been assigned to Brussels, and no one had told me! So here
                    I am, all prepared to go to SAIS and it was only because a nice, but rather
                    blabby secretary said to me that she hoped I enjoyed Brussels. I asked her what
                    she was talking about and she blanched and apologized and said I had better see
                    a personnel officer right away.</p>
                <p>Actually I had a benefactor. This was Melvin Manfull who had been the counselor
                    for Political Affairs in Saigon, and my boss, before Phil Habib arrived to
                    become counselor in '65. Melvin appreciated my work and was looking for an
                    internal political affairs officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was himself...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: He was DCM in Brussels and he tabbed me, but nobody told me. So meanwhile
                    I'm chasing universities all around the place. But this was a very welcome thing
                    because it was a chance to...we didn't really want to go to Graduate School, I
                    had been to Graduate School. Good grief. But actually I had an ulterior motive.
                    I was going to use the year at school as a chance to look around and get out, to
                    see what else there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being rather disillusioned by your Vietnam experiences

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, because I knew that everything would probably prove an anticlimax
                    after that, at least for a very long time, and I was right. It was very heady
                    stuff. You know we had a lot of people who left after Vietnam...Holbrooke and
                    many others.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Lake had been a Special Assistant to a DAS. Anyway, a lot of people left
                    and in part it was sort of a postpartum depression, if you will, that caused
                    them to leave the Service. They thought that it was ideological, you know a
                    matter of principle. But I think a part of it was that their nervous systems had
                    liked the excitement very much, and now it was the humdrum of regular life.</p>

                    the trade union movement, as a matter of fact, before. And then later it was
                    Bill Buell, who had been in European Affairs very widely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: First Melvin Manfull and then Lou Boochever came, because we had a
                    succession of ambassadors, you know, who were almost always political
                    appointees.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, we had six, seven months of a career man whose name escapes me right
                    now, but he was succeeded by John Eisenhower, son of the President, and then
                    succeeded by... isn't this awful, I'm drawing some blanks here. I can see him
                    now...</p>
                <p>It was the beginning, in 1968, of a very intense phase of community conflict in
                    Belgium between the Dutch speakers, or Flemings, and the French speakers, both
                    those of Brussels and of Wallonia. What had happened was that it literally cut
                    the University of Louvain in half. Every other library book was sent to the new
                    French faculties of the university established about fifteen miles away from the
                    original university. There was interest because there was concern that Belgium
                    itself might split into pieces and that NATO would be harmed at a time when NATO
                    was moving up from Paris, you'll recall, because De Gaulle had handed them their
                    walking papers.</p>
                <p>So there was some interest, but not a great deal. But I think when you go from
                    Vietnam to Belgium you are going from excessive U.S. interest in a place, to
                    virtually no interest in a place. It was really like being put on starvation
                    rations after a banquet, as it were.</p>

                <p>MARSH: I talked with political party people for the most part, and
                    parliamentarians. Those were my contacts. After all we did have a Labor attach�
                    and a great percentage of Belgians are members of trade unions, probably about
                    two thirds of the working population belongs to unions. So that he would look
                    after that sort of thing, but I would look after parliamentarians. Belgians I
                    found very accessible. The only thing was that at 37 and a second secretary,
                    there was a general assumption that I was like those 38-40 year old Soviet
                    second secretaries, who were clearly KGB. Because after all, why would someone
                    37 be a second secretary?</p>

                <p>Q: You were going out to see... these were not government officials, these were
                    politicians, and you were going out of the embassy to see them at party
                    headquarters, or to have lunch?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That is so, but many of them were members of Parliament, as well. I knew
                    Ministers and that sort of thing. In those days I wasn't supposed to see
                    Ministers, but on the other hand they didn't stop me from seeing politicians
                    when they became Ministers. Also, I was supposed to identify for the future the
                    coming politicians of that day.</p>
                <p>Remember 1968 was a year of incredible turmoil in Europe what witthe students

                <p>MARSH: ...explosions all over the rest of Europe. When people saw 1968 on the
                    wall calendar, somehow the numbers changed into 1848 and expected revolution to
                    be resulting from it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even in Belgium there was a certain amount of

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I did, as a matter of fact. There was of course a great conference
                    in 1969 with representatives from the Department coming out with those of us
                    from European embassies. People like Roz Ridgway coming over and Sandy
                    Vogelgesang and other people and we all met in Bonn for a conference on youth
                    affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Roz Ridgway and Sandy Vogelgesang what were they, were

                <p>MARSH: No, they were in the field, in Europe.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>MARSH: I'm saying that people were coming from all over to be addressed by these
                    people from the Department. They were telling us that not only were we to put a
                    great deal of attention to the coverage of youth affairs, but by youth affairs
                    they meant high schoolers, as well as university people. They wanted to know
                    what to expect in coming years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do that? How does a 37-year-old second
                        secretarreach out to high school students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, we couldn't do it, of course we couldn't do it. We couldn't do it
                    for the simple reason that we were too few in number and had too many things to
                    do for that sort of thing. So it was just another time when we listened to
                    people from State telling us the things they were saying because the real
                    audience was back at home in the Department and White House and so forth, not
                    the faces in front of them. And we listened to them...yes, right, sure...and
                    none of us had the slightest intention of going to high school number one to go
                    and snoop on what high schoolers were thinking about. We also thought that high
                    schoolers weren't entitled to political opinions, you had to be older.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me take a flyer at this in another way. You are sitting in an embassy and
                    you are trying to be in touch with and get to know youth leaders in Belgium. For
                    example you would read in the daily papers that there had been a rally addressed
                    by three or four different people. Might that for example give you a lead where
                    you felt that you could call up one of these student spokesmen and ask if you
                    could come around and talk with them a bit more about their views?</p>
                <p>MARSH: No, it did not. Why, because there are some phony precepts at work here.
                    And one of them is that one can ingratiate oneself across an ocean with people
                    far younger than one and with entirely different notions and so forth and that
                    somehow a trusting relationship will work out between generations, as it were.
                    No, it simply doesn't work.</p>
                <p>In the first place the very high profile and visibility of American diplomats is
                    such that they can't just wander among the population, speak to people as they
                    will. Not normally. Not usually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this case you would be wandering around a university
                        campus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, at that time, too, the Vietnam War is still on. My wife and I had
                    been in a Rome hotel in '65, when we were going around the world, when a huge,
                    huge parade went down the Via Cavour, one of the main streets of Rome, and the
                    chant is “U.S.-SS... U.S.-SS.” In other words, that the United States was the
                    equivalent of the Nazi hordes.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Q: This is a little bit analogous to the difficulty that you might have had at
                    Berkeley. That is to say that spokesmen for youth organizations and university
                    student organizations in Belgium didn't want to talk with you, you were the
                    imperialist enemy.</p>
                <p>MARSH: If they wanted to talk with us what they wanted to do was wag their heads
                    and fingers at us. To condemn us and tell us in highly idealistic terms what we
                    ought to do hither, thither and yon taking into account to no extent the United
                    States' responsibility for maintaining the peace of the world at that time. So
                    the talk of high school and university students at that time was endless because
                    talk was cheap. They could give us a lot of it and it was founded on nothingness
                    except rather incredible notions.</p>
                <p>I remember once at Scripps when a young man got up from Berkeley and said to me I
                    had a lot of experience in Vietnam and I was telling them what was based on that
                    experience but that my experience probably blinded me to reality. And thus,
                    they, who had never been there, were probably better able to understand what was
                    going on than I. I said that he had just condemned the academic and scholastic
                    method totally and disproved everything that there was to learning.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, let me push you a little further on this. I assume that in the embassy
                    in Brussels, as there are in many American embassies around the world, there was
                    a USIS office with public affairs officers, cultural affairs officers, and press
                    officers. The cultural affairs people would of course be in touch with
                    universities and with people who wanted to use the USIS library. Was it
                    possible, for example, to cooperate with USIS in sort of jointly reaching out to
                    young people in Belgium and getting a better feeling of what sort of the
                    average, the normal young person or student in Belgium was thinking about?</p>
                <p>MARSH: No. My experience with USIS over many, many years has been one of
                    continual surprise, on my part, over the narrowness with which these people in
                    USIA have designed and described their jobs. So that sort of taking the
                    initiative, that kind of ecumenism, no, I haven't found that. I've found that
                    instead if we wanted to get that sort of thing done we in the Political Section
                    had to do it ourselves. There were exceptions, of course, but they were very,
                    very rare. The Cultural Affairs people, for example, often it seemed to me,
                    wanted to stay as far away from anything with political content to it as humanly
                    possible. And if you couldn't hang it on a wall or listen to it perform they
                    were not about to take it up, partly because they did not want to discourage
                    their clientele. I can understand that.</p>
                <p>What I have been distressed at over the years is the way we have eroded our staff
                    within State who are to carry out these essential political tasks, not really
                    that our brethren in other agencies don't help us do that sort of work. One
                    thing about contact work. It takes an enormous amount of energy and it takes an
                    enormous amount of time and it takes a tremendous amount of probably damn-fool
                    dedication. I say damn-fool dedication because it means going beyond. It means
                    working weekends. It means taking on additional duties. What it does by no means
                    mean is going home at 5 o'clock.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Q: Okay, all right, let's explore in another direction. You worked in the
                    American embassy in Brussels for four years. What other tasks was the Department
                    of State or the United States government giving to the country team in Brussels?
                    What were some of the objectives that you were being asked to meet in terms of
                    promoting U.S. policy goals in this Western European country?</p>
                <p>MARSH: It seems to me that the instructions and the definitions were more to be
                    found in the breach than in the promise. In many ways we were there essentially
                    to keep a lid on things, to be of some sort of use. But Washington, preoccupied
                    with pressing questions of national security, was not terribly concerned about
                    what might or might not be going on in Belgium. In particular the Department was
                    not staffed to deal with possibilities and opportunities that might arise. In
                    other words, there was so much management of exceptions and by exceptions in the
                    Department, and particularly crisis management, that dealing with Belgium was
                    just not on anybody's list of priorities.</p>
                <p>Q: What I'm probing for, what I'm asking for, what I'm pulling you towards is a
                    description of how a relatively large American embassy like the one in Brussels,
                    where you have an experienced deputy chief of mission and an experienced
                    political counselor and economic counselor. These are the officers who are
                    really running the embassy and directing and motivating the staff. In terms of
                    you job as the internal political affairs officer, what kinds of things were
                    they asking you to get into?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I had become an FSO-4 on a scale of eight in 1967. They were giving me
                    lots of CODELs to deal with. They were giving me lots of special papers,
                    briefing papers and so forth to write. In other words the same sort of thing
                    that I had been doing in the Vietnam Working Group, that I had been doing to a
                    lesser extent but still doing in Saigon.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you having fun? Were you having a good time? I would think that one of
                    the things you would do a fair amount of as the internal political officer is to
                    travel around the country, talk with provincial politicians, talk with municipal
                    people.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, that's so, and it's a fascinating country to visit. There was a
                    payoff later, when we reached 1984, I will tell you there was a payoff for the
                    public interest in what I had been doing. At this point, frankly, what I want to
                    deplore is that we have cut positions so rigorously all around the world that we
                    don't have enough people who have the right talent and the right dedication to
                    do this kind of contact work. To lay the tracks, as it were, so that the train
                    can operate in years to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went around were you using an embassy car or were
                        yousing your own car or were you taking public transportation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>MARSH: I never had an embassy car. The only time I ever had an embassy car until
                    I became, later, a DCM and later chief of mission and had a car was in Saigon.
                    We had jeeps in Saigon and I noticed that over the weekend sometime 200 miles
                    had been put on these jeeps. I found out that the Foreign Service Nationals were
                    using them and so I said the heck with that and handed them out, the four jeeps
                    to people, and we drove ourselves around the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get per diem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Sometimes, if you were going to a provincial place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes. Belgium is small enough, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It's the size, all told, of Maryland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You could leave your home in the morning and visit
                        one otwo provinces and be back for dinner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's true, but, you know, he who is absent very much from the halls of
                    an embassy is pretty soon disregarded. You have to be around to know what's
                    going on, and to participate in office politics is a very important thing if you
                    are going to protect your job and, in fact, enhance it. And another thing is
                    that the demands made by political appointees, as ambassadors, are often very
                    great indeed in terms of personal service of all kinds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not just CODELS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, no. For example it so happened that a remote ancestor of mine had been
                    Lincoln's telegrapher, and wrote a book called Telegraphing in Battle. John S.
                    D. Eisenhower, was a military historian, and as soon as I happened to mention
                    this book, why, his eyes lighted up. I became an entirely different person. He
                    wanted to talk military history. I had read a great deal of military history and
                    every time that I was duty officer he would always say let's jump in an embassy
                    car and visit Verdun or something of that sort.</p>
                <p>I had to talk him out of that all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Again, one of the things the Department doesn't do with political appointees, it
                    really doesn't give them very much of a foretaste of what their lives are going
                    to be like. It doesn't tell people, for example, that as chief of mission they
                    are going to have to read more than they have ever read before in their lives.
                    Many businessmen coming in have no experience of reading fifty pages of cable a
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't there an ambassador's school now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Pardon my laughter. Let's move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. We are now in 1972. You've been in Belgium for
                        fouyears. You are due for reassignment. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I managed to get myself assigned to the Delegation to the Vietnam Talks in
                    Paris. It had been my dream for many, many years. I had four years of French in
                    high school, taught by Parisians, by the way. I had always wanted to live in
                    Paris and so I got myself that job. It was absolutely fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom were you working for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I was working really for the deputy chief of mission,who was Heyward
                    Isham, of the delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chief of delegation? Was it Kissinger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The question is really which delegation because we had the public talks,
                    the weekly talks, held at the International Conference Center in Paris and then
                    we had the Kissinger meetings that were Secret, back channel, and held out in
                    the suburbs. So it was a fascinating life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were with the official delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was with both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with both. The deputy was Heyward Isham, the head
                        othe delegation was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, Lord. The last position was Bill...I can't think of hilast name. He
                    was ambassador to Canada. This is awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not Robinson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No...no...no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your duties with the delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, my duties with the public delegation to the public talks, is what I
                    mean, was to write the weekly presentation. And to do such other tasks as were
                    fitting with respect to the work, and to maintain liaison with the delegation of
                    South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About how many officers on the official delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: On the official delegation we had a half dozen or so, I would say. We also
                    helped one another out so I met with the weekly press conference after the
                    meeting held in Paris in the International Conference Center. When David
                    Lambertson, the press attach�, was away for one reason or another, I would take
                    that. He would do my work, if I were away.</p>
                <p>And then on the Kissinger Delegation I was a factotum who would do all the
                    necessary and proper things to make sure that all the information possible
                    reached Dr. Kissinger from all over the place. At first he was the Assistant to
                    the President and later he was that and Secretary of State. Because you see
                    after we signed the agreement in January of 1973 he came back for some follow-up
                    talks a couple of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course he was only there from time to time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct. He was an extraordinary man...he is aextraordinary man, I
                    shouldn't talk about him in the past tense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, in the first place, he is the quickest and most supple thinker I
                    have ever encountered in my life. Just amazing. Time and again he would come up
                    with something and all of us would ask ourselves now why in heaven's name didn't
                    I think of that? It was so appropriate, so incisive and so original. But, still,
                    we who had so much more experience on the ground should have thought of that
                    sort of thing. But it was just that we were Salieri and he was Mozart!</p>
                <p>Plus he had a sense of humor. I have always appreciated a good sense of humor,
                    particularly when it is based on certain ironies and that is the very nature of
                    the Kissingerian humor. The man used to break me up, quite unintentionally,
                    every once in a while. Now he could be scathing. I have seen senior ambassadors
                    of the United States reduced to jelly by some of his cutting condemnations and
                    admonitions, just all aquiver, I mean really, literally. Again I was relatively
                    young, well in my early forties, but my father always taught me not to take very
                    much from public people unless you happened to be married to them or they were
                    wearing a clerical collar or something of that sort. Neither condition applied
                    to Dr. Kissinger so I would speak right back to him, and he respected that. So
                    we got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So these negotiations then I gather were fairly continuous
                        anongoing, at least on the official side from '72 to '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, you see what happened, after we signed the basic agreement we then
                    held super secret negotiations on a program of economic aid for North Vietnam.
                    Never publicized. I stayed on with a small delegation, very small, just two
                    officers and one secretary...a fellow who worked for me and a secretary who
                    served us both and yours truly... to act as a matrix for these economic
                    negotiations. But at any rate in the Carter Administration, my Top-Secret NODIS
                    cables were all declassified in one day. The amazing thing is they really didn't
                    cause much of an uproar.</p>
                <p>Q: I want to take you back to your work for the delegation. What can you tell us
                    about your North Vietnamese and Vietcong counterparts? Who were they, how was
                    their negotiating style different from yours?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, in the first place, they didn't negotiate in any public forum at
                    all, or even any closed forum. And they would never negotiate in the presence of
                    the South Vietnamese. The interesting thing is they had contempt for the
                    so-called Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, that is to say
                    the Vietcong Delegation, and couldn't stand Madame Binh, who was the head of
                    that delegation. So there were times when they refused to talk privately with us
                    when somehow or other the Vietcong Delegation had gotten wind of the meeting and
                    had come to the meeting. They would put it off... the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of those meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Some of them. But the point is the basic courtesies and pleasantries were
                    always absent. The only thing that they could talk about...very few spoke
                    English incidentally. Some spoke French. The only thing they could talk about
                    was the weather. I remember one time I had my two sons at the Arc de Triomphe,
                    we were looking at the great ceremonial fire there. It was either on Armistice
                    Day or near it, something of that sort, and I had taken the boys there and was
                    telling them about World War I, and all of a sudden the North Vietnamese
                    delegation shows up there! I would say a dozen had come out, all virtually in
                    lockstep marching along. The only thing they could talk about was the weather.
                    It was raining like the devil that day, the weather was absolutely ghastly, and
                    the other topic of conversation was what was the weather like where you come
                    from?</p>
                <p>You know you don't get very far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doesn't sound too thrilling!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No. Now there were very few who were with that delegation, senior
                    political leaders, and one trusted senior fellow from the Foreign Ministry and
                    they could talk substance. But the rest of those forty staff, all aides and that
                    sort of thing, would never engage on anything concerning substance whatsoever.
                    Never.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have pizza brought in or chop suey and sort
                        of havlunch together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes, and those were chilly affairs and we tended to stay on our
                    respective sides. We had bilateral talks out in the suburbs, quadrilateral talks
                    in Paris, although we said it was two-sided talks, you remember that.</p>
                <p>Q: It's sounding a little bit like what I imagine the talks between the two sides
                    in the DMZ at Panmunjom are probably like. Very sort of set piece talks with
                    statements being read but not really much sort of face to face negotiation.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Actually there was negotiation but really it was Dr. Kissinger with a
                    Vietnamese counterpart taking a walk and talking of things out of earshot and
                    that kind of thing. There was a great deal of subtlety and the real breakthrough
                    came after the North Vietnamese had surprised us by rejecting the terms we
                    offered and calling off the negotiations in late 1972. They went back to Hanoi
                    and the Christmas bombing resulted. That brought about their acceptance because
                    they were so surprised. As a matter of fact the delegation's plane was landing
                    at Hanoi Airport and the air raid siren went off and they ran into the terminal.
                    A bomb came down and blew their plane to pieces, in front of their eyes. This
                    apparently had a very strong effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Q: A very sobering effect. Wow! Anything else that you can think of that an
                    historian would be interested in knowing about this negotiating period, from '72
                    to '74?</p>
                <p>MARSH: The thing that I would emphasize is that it is very difficult to make
                    comparisons between this and other negotiations. You mention Panmunjom, well, of
                    course, there really hadn't been negotiations there. Not until very recently had
                    the North Koreans undertaken the slightest kinds of talks with us about things.
                    For forty odd years they were really messing with negotiations. With the Soviets
                    it took a long time but ultimately, yes, you reached an agreement on strategic
                    arms, something of that sort. But the point is that effort by President Johnson
                    and his successors from '65 on just came to nothing. They were up against an
                    absolutely implacable adversary there. The irony of the situation was that our
                    policy of military restraint against North Vietnam, when finally abandoned, in
                    Christmas of 1972, brought about the desired result. I don't see much
                    revisionist writing to say, well, we should have lambasted them in 1964, '65. I
                    don't see it. But you have to admit the possibility that it might have proven
                    very fruitful.</p>
                <p>Q: I want to twist your arm, Bill, a little. The United States has to negotiate
                    with a number of what have appeared over the years as fairly implacable
                    adversaries. I am thinking either of negotiating with the Soviet Union, of
                    negotiating with the Iranians over the release of our hostages from the embassy
                    in Teheran; I'm thinking about the North Koreans. I'm also thinking about
                    negotiating with terrorists and hostage-takers who have this sort of extreme
                    position that there will be no negotiation but just you do what we want or we
                    kill the hostages.</p>
                <p>Now you've had experience, you've had direct experience as a State Department
                    negotiator dealing with another side that is very, very difficult to deal with.
                    Have you got any sort of advice or insights or suggestions?</p>
                <p>MARSH: First of all, I don't really regard myself as much of a pundit, Nick, when
                    it comes to these sorts of questions. I don't know what makes Saddam Hussein
                    tick, and how you convert him into a reasonable human being. I'm prepared to
                    believe it is an impossible task, and missions impossible are not exactly my
                    forte. In negotiations, and I've had a lot of experience in negotiations because
                    we have negotiated things in which I have been approached to participate in,
                    such as keeping the PLO out of international organizations. I had lots of
                    experience in that in Geneva and elsewhere. That involved a lot of negotiating
                    and politicking. There is not really an awful lot of difference in my view.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>But what's involved in negotiating and politicking, of course, is an exchange of
                    interests in which both sides agree that in return for giving up something they
                    will receive something and there will be an acceptable balance struck. When you
                    are dealing with terrorists, these are be-all and end-all types, it seems to me,
                    and it's our position that we don't negotiate with them. It's not their
                    position. They'd love to negotiate with the United States because they would
                    love the dignity of sitting down with the only super power and despite this Mutt
                    and Jeff disparity in size and, frankly, in virtue, that they could be welcome
                    at the same table with us.</p>
                <p>I would want to emphasize, however, the crucial role that experience and prior
                    knowledge play in crisis situations and in negotiations. The great thing that
                    hurt us, it seems to me, in Vietnam more than any other thing, was that we
                    didn't know anything about the place. We attempted to apply our leverage from
                    outside without really understanding whether this would have the desired effect.
                    The tragedy was, of course, the enormous cost for the utterly unacceptable
                    ultimate results. That's the great tragedy of the thing.</p>
                <p>Now I'm being a little hard on the Department, here, but let me just say
                    something about the Belgium experience. I asked around, because you know we had
                    travel grants that we could put out. We did have some cooperation from USIA,
                    from USIS. I found the head of the youth movement in West Flanders, the
                    Christian Democratic Youth Movement in West Flanders, simply because I asked
                    some senior Christian Democratic politicians who, in their view, would be good
                    people to send to the United States on leader grants. They directed me to one
                    Wilfred Martens, who became Prime Minister many times over. I left in '72 from
                    Belgium, and when I returned in '84, he was Prime Minister. This had some
                    utility. I'll say no more.</p>
                <p>Q: One final question that I just wanted to ask, get your opinion about. Some
                    people feel that there are certain negotiating skills that some people possess
                    and others don't and that there should be sort of a team of professional
                    negotiators who negotiate from the Untied States no matter whether it is
                    aviation agreements or hostages or ending a trade embargo or whatever. Now you
                    have made the point already that you believe that people who go into
                    negotiations should know as much as they possibly can about the context of the
                    people you are dealing with. What do you think of this idea of sort of a small
                    cadre of sort of permanent U.S. negotiators?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, frankly, not much. And the reason is that each negotiation advances
                    the current distinct interests of the United States, or is supposed to. Each set
                    of negotiations has a different clientele of interests in the United States. Now
                    State knows more about effective negotiation than anybody else does. I'm utterly
                    convinced of that. Dr. Kissinger certainly knew how to rely on the Foreign
                    Service for his various negotiations. Other Secretaries, I think particularly of
                    Baker, belittled the Foreign Service and did not really make proper avail of it.
                    But I think that was exceptional. Secretary Shultz certainly knew how to use it
                    and did frequently.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>The thing is that the Department does not, frankly, enjoy the trust of an
                    enormous part of the American population and particularly among some of the
                    leaders of some of its most significant interests in the private sector. Thus I
                    don't think that we can say we are double-jointed and will negotiate all these
                    sorts of things. That won't wash. But on the other hand, what we can do is to
                    chair, and usually do, chair negotiations and keep under control the various
                    interests. I will never forget the one international conference, a United
                    Nations conference, in which some members of the United States Delegation took
                    the floor to attack U.S. policy. Stupefaction resulted from that, worldwide
                    stupefaction! No one had ever seen anything like that before. A friend of mine,
                    who was very versed in these things, said the purpose of the Department of State
                    in international delegations is to provide adult supervision. And that is
                    probably very much the case.</p>
                <p>It would be very nice.</p>
                <p>I would just like to amend what you said, Nick, to say that knowledgeable people
                    from State should be part of each and every delegation. Besides, perhaps, having
                    a State chairman of it there should be someone at the working level who really
                    knows what he is talking about, who the other side is and that sort of thing.
                    That said, we have to be prepared in State, I'm still saying “we” even though I
                    am now retired. We have to be prepared at State to devote far more training and
                    far more time in terms of assignments and so forth to crisis management,
                    terrorists, negotiation, and all of these key things than we have ever shown an
                    inclination to do before this time.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, well, thank you very much. Bill, we've now reached 1974 and you are
                    finishing two years in Paris with the peace negotiations there. What happens
                    next? Where are you going to take us next in 1974?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I'm going to take you in 1974 to the accomplishment of something I
                    realized was a very important necessity for me. I have now been fourteen years
                    in the Foreign Service and I have never served in a, shall we say, normal
                    Washington assignment. Whereas I have achieved, with a four-year tour in
                    Belgium, I have achieved my goal of having a normal foreign assignment I had
                    never had a normal Washington assignment before that time. So I actually
                    curtailed in Paris. Brilliant, huh?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were only there for two years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I had a three-year assignment and probably could have stayed another year.
                    But there wasn't that much to do, and I like to keep busy. And so I became the
                    deputy director of the Office of Western European Affairs, in the Bureau of
                    European Affairs in the Department.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And French country director, if you will. So my Francophilia was satisfied
                    and my desire to see normalcy, but note, this guy is 43 and he is just
                    discovering how a normal State operation functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, we will look forward into getting into that
                        next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***This is Nick Heyniger and today is December 16, 1997. I am interviewing Bill
                    Marsh about his experiences in the Foreign Service. We have now reached the year
                    1974 and Bill is returning from the Paris Peace Mission to become deputy
                    director of the Office of Western European Affairs in the Department. So, Bill,
                    tell me what you were doing in WE.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Nick, I arrived just as interesting developments were about to take place.
                    First of all, the Bureau of European Affairs was going to deal with the Cyprus
                    crisis. Mind you that as of July 1, 1974, the offices for Greece, Turkey and
                    Cyprus had been transferred from Near East and South Asian Affairs to European
                    Affairs. Not long afterwards the Cyprus crisis broke out.</p>
                <p>The problem was a very difficult one for the European Affairs Bureau because it
                    was really quite unfamiliar with its new territories, as it were. And also
                    because it had not had too many instances when it was in a crisis mode. Someone
                    is going to say what are you talking about, there was the Hungarian uprising and
                    the Berlin War and this and that and the Czechoslovakian crisis of 1968 and so
                    forth, and, yes, that's true, but these were shared with an awful lot of other
                    people. That is, in Washington terms they were shared with other agencies and
                    people and in particular with the National Security Council. But the second
                    major development that was taking place was the decline and fall of the Nixon
                    Government.</p>
                <p>In August, of course, the President resigned which was a singular crisis and one
                    we had never had before, not a resignation, not a resignation under a cloud in
                    any event. Unfortunately, we had had assassinations and that sort of thing, but
                    still it was very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No president had ever resigned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No president had ever resigned. Well, in any event, here am.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what were your duties? What were you primarily
                        involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>MARSH: Allow me to say that I was forever trying to define them. That there was
                    no set of tablets from some Moses coming down the mountain saying, Bill, we want
                    you to do this and that and the other thing. And once again one is supposed to
                    intuit or grasp or guess or estimate or what have you what to do. It was also a
                    bit difficult because I was working for a very strong willed, very opinionated
                    boss, Richard Vine. He, along with many others in the Bureau, had many, many
                    years of European experience. I, having just come from Paris, but still having
                    come from the Vietnam Peace Mission, was regarded as an Asiatic who had somehow
                    made his way into the sacred halls of European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In spite of your four years in Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In spite of my four years in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk with Dick about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: When I could, but of course Dick was around for about a month and then
                    became deputy assistant secretary for Canadian Affairs. So once again there was
                    a problem of shifts in personnel. Actually the position of deputy director of an
                    office in the Department is a very anomalous one, because one is supposed to be
                    an alter ego and that is combined with being a country director. So I was French
                    country director, for French Affairs. In any event I think it was pretty
                    interesting work. I was eager to have it, because here I was 43, and it was the
                    first geographic desk I had ever worked on in the Department, barring Vietnam
                    which was not a geographic desk but a maelstrom, for heaven's sakes.</p>
                <p>I had a psychological problem, in the interest of full disclosure. I haven't gone
                    into a great deal of detail about the Vietnam years because I was handling that
                    in another portion. But in any event, between '66 and '68, on the Vietnam
                    Working Group it was such a horrendous time both emotionally and physically, I
                    always approached Department assignments with great dread thereafter. Not least
                    because for four months my work assignment on the Vietnam Working Group had been
                    36 hours on, 12 hours off, seven days a week, 30 or 31 days a month, etc. This
                    was such a crippling and completely exhausting situation that it left me with,
                    not mingle feelings, but as I say, great dread about going back to the
                    Department. But it is a necessity and an important thing to do.</p>
                <p>What did I do? Well, at the time, Secretary Kissinger, Mr. Sonnenfeldt and Arthur
                    Hartman, who was the Assistant Secretary, were all very experienced, very
                    capable. Dealing with the Western European countries was the very linchpin and
                    focus of their international efforts. So things were taking place well in the
                    stratosphere up ahead of present company.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Q: You keep climbing the Foreign Service ladder and still the decision-making and
                    policy-making always seems to be another couple of rungs up!</p>
                <p>MARSH: Too true, too totally true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in effect you were country director for France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct and I did have a young fellow as my deputy, which was very
                    helpful. You'll remember it has been eight years since I supervised seven people
                    in Vietnam and it is going to be, as a matter of fact, another 13 years before I
                    supervise seven people again. So there is a 20-year period there when I did not
                    supervise as many people as I had done when I was a very junior officer in
                    Vietnam. At any rate, long, long waits are involved here.A couple of things in
                    particular, I deal with. First of all, there was no money for me to go to any
                    Western European posts during my service. It is customary one go out. So I
                    hitch-hiked on a military flight to Brussels, and paid my own way from Brussels
                    to Paris and then went back a week later and took the return military flight,
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: This is another example of the Department being really strapped for funds and
                    not able to give its officers the funds that you think are required to do an
                    adequate job.</p>
                <p>MARSH: You can only get money in the Department, it seems to me, if somehow you
                    work the word “management” or “administration” into it. But for the actual
                    conduct of the business of the nation, there is never money. But there is always
                    money for administrative conferences. There is always money for information
                    management. I still don't understand what that is; in fact I thought that was
                    everybody's job, to tell you the truth, information management. I made it very
                    clear in later years that nobody was going to manage my information but me
                    because I was responsible for it.</p>
                <p>In any event I spent a great deal of time trying to see what there was to do
                    beyond the standard routine of briefing papers, briefing papers, briefing
                    papers, trip papers for those who were going out. Because some people had money
                    and could visit my posts, even if there wasn't any for me. But this, of course,
                    is a tremendous routine.</p>
                <p>There were a few funny instances. I am going to relate them because it tells you
                    how to get a reputation within the halls of the Department of State. In one of
                    them...I went in, as was my wont on a Saturday. So did Dick Vine, who had gone
                    in frequently. Dick had gone in very relaxed attire, whereas I had a jacket and
                    tie on and so forth. Dick came and told me that the Big Four meeting scheduled
                    to be held at Camp David was going to be held in the Department because of bad
                    weather.</p>
                <p>Q: Excuse me. Who are the Big Four?</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>MARSH: The Big Four are Britain, Germany, France and the United States, a
                    periodic consultative group, in this case of foreign ministers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, it is coming up and it is supposed to be at Camp
                        David bubecause of bad weather it is being held in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. And each office is supposed to supply one officer to just
                    sit, in case, as the French say, just in case someone was needed. So there were
                    the three of us. Obviously the whole staff secretariat was there to cover
                    Secretary Kissinger, but only one U.S. officer for each of the other countries.
                    And I'm sitting there and they break up their conversations and come down. The
                    three of us from the offices are on the ground floor and Secretary Kissinger
                    advances on us. So, of course, we all rise to our feet and he looks us over and
                    recognizes me and comes up and says, “Mr. Marsh, I need you.” So I walk off with
                    the Secretary and he says to me, “Would you please show Foreign Minister
                    Sauvagnargues,” of France, “Would you please show him to the bathroom.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marvelous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: This, for once in a low voice, he tells me. So I go off and next I escort
                    Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues about, as my colleagues watch enviously, and
                    disappear with him in a different direction. I didn't bother to tell them it was
                    to the facilities. But at any rate for days afterwards the building buzzed.
                    Secretary Kissinger knew Bill's name.</p>
                <p>Another time was during something that occupied a great deal of my effort, namely
                    the State visit of President Giscard D'Estaing of France in 1976. There was a
                    luncheon at the Department for him, and my wife and I were among the invited.
                    Please don't say cynically that I made up the guest lists! Any guest list that I
                    ever prepared for Kissinger was an approximation. It was bound to change many
                    times before it came out. Naturally I put my name on it, but I was astonished to
                    see it remained there.So at any rate, it came time for the toasts and the
                    Secretary pulls a paper out of his pocket and says “Normally when I receive
                    something from the geographic desk I don't pay any attention to it. But this was
                    so good I thought I would use it.” And he then proceeded to read my toast
                    verbatim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody know it was your toast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes, the word gets around. Because everybody was always trying to
                    figure out what would please, satisfy and gratify the Secretary of State. No
                    matter who he was. That was always the name of the game. And the next day I had
                    a call from a deputy assistant secretary in another Bureau who said would I help
                    him write a memo to go up to the Secretary, as I seemed to have some success
                    with that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful. Wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: So, how to get ahead in the State Department without realltrying, these
                    were a couple of the ways!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why sure. Bill, what would you say were a couple of
                        thhighlights of American relations with France. This is 1974 to 1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I think we had a very, very good visit by Giscard D'Estaing. That helped a
                    great deal. I think the French particularly appreciated that the State dinner at
                    the White House, over which President Ford presided, happened during the
                    Michigan Primary. President Ford was a real class act at that time, because
                    obviously this was very much on his mind, touch and go. But finally at the end
                    of the evening came the word that he, indeed, had won the Michigan Primary. But
                    this, indeed, was a gentleman and you had to admire that sort of thing. I was
                    proud to even have a small part in observing such strength of character. He was
                    superb.Of course relations with the French are always touchy because they don't
                    do what we want easily or readily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a reasonably good relationship with the
                        embassy, foexample?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Excellent. It was very good. We were frequently there. Iwas very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Remember who the ambassador was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The ambassador, Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet, later became Senator and was
                    from a family in the Champagne Region of France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't deal with him very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I dealt more frequently with the DCM, the deputy chief omission, and the
                    political counselor.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get some good meals at the French embassy
                        residence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You bet! My wife was invited and we met very interestinpeople.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular contretemps? Any particular rough
                        spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, in fact we had some I think particularly congruent relationships. Once
                    the Department was, in a rather craven fashion, going to hold a reception as
                    requested by a Congressman whose name had very recently been touched with a
                    scandal thanks to a 'popsie' that he had been seeing. The President of the
                    Senate of France was to visit.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, you were telling us about the reception the Department had planned at
                    the request of a congressman who had recently been in a scandal.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. The Congressman wanted the Department to pay for a reception to be
                    hosted by the Congressman for the President of the French Senate, who was to
                    visit the United States. I was to prepare a guest list. Frankly I was revolted
                    by the notion that we would spend money on this loser. I mean the American, not
                    the Frenchman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This miscreant!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: So I thought about this for awhile and then I called the French
                    ambassador. I wanted to make sure that the ambassador knew that this was afoot
                    so I very sweetly asked the ambassador whether he had any suggestions for a
                    guest list, and how nice it was there was going to be such a reception, given
                    the Congressman's recent very prominent romantic difficulties. Butter wouldn't
                    have melted in my mouth of course, on the thing. The ambassador read me
                    immediately and said he would get back to me. And he did a couple of days later,
                    to say that the President of the Senate had been obliged to cancel his visit to
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>This I consider a certain accomplishment, as a matter of fact, in the improvement
                    of relations because the French cannot stand to be pawns in the internal
                    political games of the Americans.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, give us one or two insights about Departmental politics and the art of
                    being a deputy office director. You've told us a couple of interesting and
                    amusing vignettes, but on the substantive side, do you have any experiences with
                    how to get the job done back in Washington?</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>MARSH: It seems to me that the particularities of such a thing are paramount in
                    importance. So much concerns the personalities involved. How to get the papers
                    moved without staying there until eight or nine at night. Now, again, I'm a
                    creature of an earlier age, when you saw lots of offices where officers were
                    still there at seven and seven-thirty. I don't see that very much anymore. It
                    seems to me that only up on the seventh floor so you have that sort of thing and
                    the rest of the Bureaus come and go, as they will. There is much less time spent
                    in the building by lots and lots of officers, particularly younger officers. I
                    had no preparation before coming into the Foreign Service for the twelve,
                    thirteen-hour day that was all too common in the '60s and the '70s, not so much
                    in more recent times.</p>
                <p>But in any event one has to be prepared to use one's time and one's efforts as
                    aggressively as possible. Dominate your agenda, if at all possible. If there
                    isn't an agenda, prepare one and say now these are the things that I believe
                    that we should talk about. Wherever possible have papers prepared in advance for
                    a meeting that people can sign off on so that you can get people pinned down on
                    it. There are too many people who, of course, want to use up time. You know we
                    have a lot of peers in other agencies, and even in parts of the Department, who
                    really have the problem of filling up their days. Whereas at the geographic
                    desks in the political bureaus we don't have that problem. Our problem is
                    getting everything done!</p>
                <p>So that you've got a piece of paper, and you get five-sixths of the meeting
                    agreed on, it is the sixth person who'd really like to take it home and mess
                    with it for a few days or weeks who will sign off because of the pressure of his
                    peers. So in a way it's sort of like manipulating a jury, it seems to me.</p>
                <p>It is essential to avoid behavior that can be construed by one's superiors as
                    constituting a threat. So you have to fawn a bit and say, “Now is this what you
                    thought? Was it your idea that we should such and such”...when they had no idea
                    at all. It takes a certain amount of oiliness it seems to me. Sometimes, indeed,
                    the exact reverse is possible.I would just point to the future a little bit.
                    When I was deputy chief of mission in Geneva and my first ambassador of two
                    while I was there, both political appointees, the first ambassador wanted
                    nothing to do with substance. He wanted strictly to do with representation and
                    the administrative side of the house and left all substance to me. The next
                    ambassador wanted the exact opposite. And so one has to be the vicar of Bray,
                    who changes his collar to suit the regime and one has to be prepared to be
                    infinitely adaptable. It isn't easy. On the other hand, it isn't boring either
                    because the humdrum, steady plodding repetition of things year after year after
                    year in the same place, in the same job with the same people would to me be the
                    worst thing imaginable.</p>
                <p>Q: But we all know that EUR, the Bureau of European Affairs, and the Office of
                    Western European Affairs is one of the premier places to be in the Department.
                    There is always something going on there. Anything that you'd like to say about
                    working on the fourth or fifth floor of the Department about relations with the
                    Seventh Floor or relations with the NSC or with other agencies?</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>MARSH: These came really a little later. We had a unique situation in my first
                    assignment in the Department upon coming back in 1974 in that Secretary
                    Kissinger was also Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. So
                    we had fusion of powers, as it were, instead of confrontation. That was
                    remarkable. It was when Secretary Kissinger left and President Carter came in
                    and brought a new NSC with him. I actually had different responsibilities at
                    that time, but things were jumping.</p>
                <p>Within the Department, you know, relations between the geographic bureau and the
                    policy planning people can be rather tense at times. But again matters depend so
                    much. For example, Secretary Baker, years later of course, in our times, modern
                    times, Secretary Baker really did not care to see more than his Under
                    Secretaries. Thus it was that a close friend of mind, an expert on Cambodia and
                    himself a deputy assistant secretary, had to brief an assistant secretary on
                    Cambodian developments, who in turn briefed an under secretary, who in turn was
                    going to meet with Secretary Baker.</p>
                <p>In the Kissinger days, I as French country director, was present as the
                    note-taker, of course, usually, but I was present at meetings between Kissinger
                    and key French officials. Thus when Francois Mitterand made his first visit to
                    the United States, my memo suggested, recommended to the Secretary that he see
                    Francois Mitterand, whereas French opposition leaders were not seen by the
                    Secretary of State prior to that time, much less the White House. So I was duly
                    there and Secretary Kissinger glared at me throughout the meeting for the simple
                    reason that the meeting went very badly, in that Monsieur Mitterand chose topics
                    that totally bored Secretary Kissinger at that time. It was a rather pointless
                    get-together. His time was wasted.</p>
                <p>But in any event operating within the building is a thing which it seems to me
                    has become somewhat constricted in recent years. It used to be that a lot more
                    people got involved in matters and now it is an ever-selected few that are
                    involved.</p>
                <p>Q: You touched a while ago on the advisability of trying to get the paper drafted
                    with the sort of tactical advantage that having a paper there for people to talk
                    about was a great advantage. Were there any instances, for example, in the
                    interagency wars and the turf battles where having you being in the State
                    Department, and having a paper prepared in advance of an interagency meeting or
                    something that was going to go to the NSC, where that paid off for you?</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, absolutely. My whole career long! Pre-emptive strike was always my
                    policy with respect to policy papers. I also would take the time to go around to
                    offices in person to get clearances on things, because they would want to get
                    rid of me. I'm talkative and very big, I fill an office very easily and they
                    don't have much space left. And since we have a lot of people who are rather
                    introverted in the Department, and I have an outgoing, ebullient kind of
                    personality they want to get rid of me so they can get back to whatever they
                    happened to be doing at the time and they sign off. I could get clearances on
                    papers faster than almost anybody else you knew could. But I didn't leave it to
                    “please look at your e-mail, where I have a thing for you,” because this just
                    invites delay.</p>
                <p>Q: Normally I assume it would be the desk officer, the desk officer for France,
                    who would be running around getting clearances, but sometimes you took this job
                    on in the interest of moving things forward?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, are we through with Western Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: We are, with the '74-'76 period.</p>
                <p>Incidentally there is one point that I would like to make that does refer to
                    Vietnam. Everybody who is at all interested in the Foreign Service should be
                    mindful of this. In the spring of 1975 Under Secretary Habib called me up to
                    work on a special Task Force for a month over the fall of Phnom Penh and Saigon
                    to the Communist forces. At that time we had some 200 Foreign Service officers
                    who were occupied in Indochina affairs in one fashion or another. Either by
                    assignment within those countries, such as in the AID business, not simply at
                    embassies and that sort of thing, and not simply at capitals. But at any rate,
                    there were about 200 officers. And with the fall of Phnom Penh and Saigon, a
                    permanent glut of Foreign Service officers ensued. We had difficulties of
                    placement from then to now, in many instances, because of that and therefore the
                    Service was a victim of the war.</p>
                <p>Q: This is sort of the other side of the situation. Maybe ten or fifteen years
                    earlier when an entire incoming class of new FSOs would be assigned to Vietnam,
                    to be pacification officers or provincial officers, now there is sort of a wave
                    of people away from Vietnam. There are not enough job possibilities in the rest
                    of Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right and frankly there is no imaginative planning othe part of the
                    Department for using officers in various capacities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as for example French-speaking Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, of course, we are talking extremely small posts there. But what I'm
                    saying is that with greater economy we could have used officers within the
                    United States for various functions, as liaison or secondment to international
                    bodies or to the Hill or what have you. Someone is going to say we had the
                    Pearson Program, or we had this or we had that, this is pretty small potatoes.
                    But at any rate, I was casting around for a job and hoping for a field job and
                    became quite worked up. I was told I should really have senior training. So I
                    said all right, that will be fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are now about 45?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: 45, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you are an FSO-3?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I'm an FSO-3 that's right. And so somebody, you will be amused to hear,
                    said that it would be very good if I would take a year at the Woodrow Wilson
                    School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University...my alma
                    mater!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another one!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I said 'been there, done that.' Q: Didn't look at your personnel
                    folder!</p>
                <p>MARSH: Exactly. So off I went to the National War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The National War College, which is a real plum. How did
                        you likthat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was lukewarm about it, to tell you the truth. In the first place it was
                    a situation where it was a holding action for a lot of potential star-ranking
                    military and naval personnel. A holding action while they got their Master's
                    Degrees from George Washington University. Also it was an introduction to
                    strategy for a lot of folks who had been dealing with highly technical and
                    technological matters for years and years and years. It was good to make the
                    contacts, yes, and some of the material was quite worthwhile.</p>
                <p>But you'll recall that the Armed Forces of the United States were not in the best
                    of shape at that time. They were emerging from the shadow of Vietnam and the
                    collapse of Indochina.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very difficult morale situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Very difficult and much was at that time under reorganization,
                    investigation, rethinking, retooling, what have you, in order to try to rectify
                    the problems that had hurt us so in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>Q: In your year at the National War college was there a lot of sort of
                    introspective examination of how we had gotten into Vietnam? What we could have
                    done differently while we were there? The military love lessons learned. Did you
                    have a lot of that? This would seem an ideal time; this was sort of a year off
                    at the National War College for just that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>MARSH: That's what I anticipated but in fact that's not what I encountered. It
                    was as if there had been a very bad divorce in the family and nobody wanted to
                    talk about it. It was still too raw, you know, and too fresh. And of course the
                    fall of '76 was just fourteen, fifteen months, something like that, after the
                    fall of Saigon. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>The military were intensely interested in negotiation and wanted to know how to
                    resolve conflicts through negotiation rather than through the search for
                    military solutions, whereas the Foreign Service officers were very interested in
                    how to resolve problems by military action. So we were exchanging personalities
                    and professional points of view, I guess.</p>
                <p>I gave some lectures at their request on Western European situations and
                    developments. But I really became interested in the Middle East through Joseph
                    Malone who was a professor there. He died just a few years afterwards,
                    unfortunately. He had superb contacts in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a professor at the National War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, that's right. Joe Malone, for example, knew Sadat extremely well. He
                    knew the Saudi monarchs very well and so forth and so on. He knew the King and
                    Crown Prince of Jordan and so forth. So he was very wise on that subject. The
                    high point of it was a trip to Israel, Jordan and Egypt, culminating, in fact
                    closing with, two hours spent with Sadat at his Alexandria palace in Egypt which
                    was unforgettable. He was a truly remarkable man, extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Q: I know the National War College sort of splits up into different teams and
                    goes to different parts of the world. You went to sort of the Near East?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us some of your recollections of what struck you
                        abouIsrael, Jordan, and Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, there were a couple of things that amazed me. In the first place we
                    went in Jordan to a Palestinian refugee camp. We had a retired Major General of
                    the Air Force as sort of our Dean who traveled with us, as our senior member, an
                    awfully nice man. We went to a Palestinian camp and of course we were submitted
                    to a great deal of verbal abuse from the Palestinians. The U.S. military were
                    totally shocked, totally unprepared for this hostility, couldn't understand it.
                    Then, back in Israel they were totally dismayed by the Israelis who showed
                    certain reserve, suspicion and not at all outgoing gratitude, friendship and so
                    forth for American assistance over the years. They brought up the “St. Louis”
                    incident of 1939, the failure to bomb the railways to the death camps, all that
                    sort of thing. In other words both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides
                    directed reproaches towards us.</p>
                <p>The military were shocked, just absolutely shocked. This was totally new to them.
                    So I suppose this trip was very useful from that standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember one or two points from your session with
                        Sadat,what he seemed to have on his mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Pretty much what you would expect. He responded to questions for the most
                    part. He said a remarkable thing in response to a question about population
                    policy in Egypt. He said, after thinking a little bit, that he didn't know the
                    answer to the question. I don't think he was stalling in any fashion at all. I
                    think he was just an extraordinary statesman.</p>
                <p>We all gasped because we had never heard any leader, certainly not in Washington,
                    ever admit he didn't know the answer to something. He said he didn't know the
                    answer, he should know the answer, and he directed an aide to find out for him
                    what the answer was and he would communicate it to us later. And did! A
                    remarkable man, an absolutely remarkable man. So this was well worthwhile, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>Q: You had already, quite early in your career, even before joining the Foreign
                    Service, you had been in the Air Force yourself. Certainly in your years in
                    Vietnam had been very much involved with the military so in a sense this was a
                    continuation for you, as an American diplomat, of sort of the political/military
                    side of American foreign policy. You went there hoping to broaden yourself and
                    to get some other perspectives, did that work out at all?</p>
                <p>MARSH: It certainly did. Let me explain one thing, when I graduated from the
                    National War College one third of the Foreign Service contingent in the class
                    had not yet any assignment. I was one of those. So I went to see my old mentor
                    from Vietnam days, Phil Habib. He blew up. Blew up. He said we put these people
                    through and it cost $55,000, 1976-77 dollars, $55,000 was the bill from the
                    military for each student.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Q: You are being groomed here to become a DCM or possibly an ambassador. You'd
                    think people coming out of the National War College would be assigned first.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, one would think that, but that wasn't the case. So I went to him and
                    he blew up. Yes, I did have some possibilities after that. But ultimately I
                    became a Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State for Security
                    Assistance, Science and Technology. Much of what we were doing was handling the
                    Middle East arms sale.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's go back now. This is 1977, you are re-assigned to the Department, and
                    who is this gentleman?MARSH: No, this lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lady?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Lucy Wilson Benson, the first woman Under Secretary of State. She had been
                    the President of the League of Woman Voters. She was a Democrat and she was
                    brought in. She knew President Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lots of people in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, the Secretary. I'm struggling with his name...from WesVirginia...what
                    was his name...the lawyer?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll get that. But in any event, what Bureau were you
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, this is Seventh Floor...this is 'T.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “T?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. “T” is supposed to oversee the Office of Politico-Military
                    Affairs, and it is also supposed to oversee certain nuclear disarmament work
                    that takes place, nuclear regulation control, and then it is supposed to oversee
                    OBS, as it was called, the Bureau of Oceans, Environmental, and Scientific
                    Affairs. But most of our time was spent with the most politically sensitive of
                    all, Security Assistance. The preparation for the annual budget for Security
                    Assistance alone was a totally exhausting and demanding job.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>One could anticipate from each House of Congress demands for additional
                    information, sometimes lists of 200, 250 questions from a single member.
                    Obviously hyperactive staff aides were grinding out this stuff on the Hill. Then
                    of course the Under Secretary would have to make many Congressional appearances
                    in support of the budget and so forth. Then there would be extraordinary periods
                    when we had a special program, such as the AWACS for Iran; such as the Middle
                    East aircraft sale in support of Camp David Agreements, and that sort of thing.
                    That was interesting, very interesting work. I'm going to skip over that a
                    little bit more hurriedly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us a little bit about Mrs. Benson. You say that she
                        habeen the President of the League of Women Voters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Cyrus Vance was the Secretary's name I was trying to reacfor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of person was Mrs. Benson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I don't want to get into traits, to tell you the truth. Buthis was her
                    first government position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a very significant thing right there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: She needed a considerable amount of support, which in fact we gave her. I
                    think she performed quite well. There was a problem in that the Bureau of
                    Politico-Military Affairs was headed by Leslie Gelb, who is a journalist and
                    very close to Cyrus Vance and President Carter and all sorts of people for years
                    and years, in a foreign policy related situation. So while he was supposed to
                    process everything through “T” to the Secretary of State and the deputy
                    secretary, Mr. Christopher, this was not always the case, as a matter of fact.
                    So we had to police matters rather carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Difficult job, very difficult job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was rather difficult. I got some very good trips out of it, though. You
                    see there is money on the Seventh Floor. There is not money to go to Bethesda
                    and lower floors, but there is money to go to Bethesda, Israel, on the Seventh
                    Floor.</p>
                <p>Q: Was Mrs. Benson particularly interested in political-military things, or was
                    she more interested in sort of environmental and scientific things?</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>MARSH: No, she was extremely interested in the most politically sensitive
                    matters. She, of course, had had long work in legislative affairs. As President
                    of the League of Women Voters she had testified at State levels and met the
                    Congress and all that sort of thing. She knew what she was doing about that.</p>
                <p>One thing that was interesting was that she commuted from Amherst, Massachusetts.
                    She just had a place to stay in Washington but really commuted because her
                    husband was a professor in Amherst and was ailing. We had to prepare an awful
                    lot of briefing books and papers and things of that sort. She used to take about
                    thirty pounds of stuff home with her over the weekend. She never left any work
                    behind, never lost any of it, she always brought it in and she knew her briefs
                    and everything else. She did all right. I had great respect and admiration for
                    her.</p>
                <p>We made a trip together which was unforgettable because we went to a place that
                    no senior American official had been before, although they have since. Secretary
                    Albright has just returned from there as a matter of fact, as we speak. That was
                    Rwanda. She (Under Secretary Benson) was the first senior American official who
                    ever visited Rwanda. We went there in 1979. She was going to give a speech at
                    the UN Environmental Program meeting in Nairobi. She was a great lover of
                    animals so we climbed Mt. Visoko in Rwanda, to see gorillas. So there we were up
                    there. Yours truly is squatting in the bush, near a family of gorillas, and all
                    I could think of, of course, is having seen the revival of King Kong. But it was
                    fascinating. Diane Fossey was up on top of the mountain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Of course; we were there overnight. We were her guests on top of the
                    mountain. It was quite extraordinary. There were other trips made, it was all
                    very good. I was to be reassigned in 1979 and managed to get myself a position
                    as counselor for Political-Military Affairs at Embassy Jeddah, in fact the first
                    counselor for Political-Military Affairs in Jeddah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Phil Habib have anything to do with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no, he didn't, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>Q: By this time, just as an insight, you have now been back in Washington since
                    1974, this has now been about five years. You are going off to a fairly isolated
                    and difficult post. How about your wife and children? For example, what was your
                    wife, Ruth, doing in Washington, and how old were your children?</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>MARSH: The boys were in seventh and fifth grade that summer. There was no eighth
                    grade at the school in Jeddah so we applied several places and my son, William,
                    Jr., whom we call Wim, was accepted at Lawrenceville. We decided that we were
                    going to put him in Lawrenceville and we were going to leave him there. He had
                    been shunted around from school to school. He started in Brussels, then went to
                    Paris and was in public school in the District and then went to private school
                    when the public school didn't pan out. He then went to St. Stephen's in
                    Alexandria [Virginia] for the seventh grade, when the first private school ran
                    out. We needed to find a place for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Lawrenceville would take him in the eighth grade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They certainly would, and did. He was there five years. Q: You had by this
                    time two children?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Two sons, that's right. The younger one, Andrew, would gwith us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Ruth been working here or had she been looking after
                        thfamily?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No. I was rather concerned as to whether I should go, whether life would
                    be worth living in Saudi Arabia, for heaven's sake. I had never been there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly for your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And particularly for my family. So I came home rather tentatively and
                    said, “Well, you know there is a chance I could go to Jeddah as counselor for
                    Political-Military Affairs” and my wife immediately said, and I'll never forget
                    it, she said that it sounded fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for her!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: So here I had been expecting her to bail me out of this! I went ahead and
                    went to Stuttgart several times for security assistance conferences but you know
                    Saudi Arabia was in the EURCOM realm of responsibility. And I stopped at
                    Stuttgart and then went on to Jeddah. They had a place all fixed up for us and
                    frankly it was the best quarters made ready for us that we had ever had in all
                    of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>It just shows what can happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So tell us the name of the administrative officer and the
                        generaservices officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, I always repress names of administrators and general services
                    officers. But the ambassador and deputy chief of mission were terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unlike your experiences, or your wife's experiences in
                        Thailand,you seemed to do fairly alright in Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, you know what the exception proves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so here you are in the burning sands of Arabia. Who
                        wayour ambassador and who was your DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Our ambassador was John West who was named by Jimmy Carter, as a neighbor,
                    as he was governor of South Carolina while Jimmy Carter was governor of
                    Georgia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did John West want to go to Jeddah?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I don't know but I'm glad he did because this was one man, and I
                    haven't met many in 36 years in the Foreign Service, where everything was for
                    the troops. Now Phil Habib had had touches of that. For example, I got overtime
                    pay for a month in the spring of '75 and everyone on the Indochina Task Force
                    then got overtime pay. I tried to turn it back because this was contrary to
                    regulations and I was told to shut up and cash it, that Mr. Habib had gotten it
                    for everyone.</p>
                <p>Which is interesting because it shows when someone does want to dsomething, to
                    get something done, they find ways to do it.</p>
                <p>Similarly, all my wife had to do when she wanted to go somewhere in Jeddah was to
                    call the embassy and a car was dispatched. John West had gotten enough cars that
                    all the wives could be accommodated since they could not drive. They never had
                    to wait more than a few minutes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even American embassy wives were not permitted to
                        drive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No women drive in Saudi Arabia. There is nothing which says they may not
                    drive, but none has ever received a driver's license, and John West just came
                    right in and picked that all up.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Q: But the job of handling U.S. relations with this important Arab country in the
                    area of things like arms sales, bases, etc., very important, what were you doing
                    and how did you enjoy it?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I enjoyed it very much. I used to tease our commercial officer who was
                    trying to push American products and by my count the total foreign military
                    sales contracts we signed during my two years in Saudi Arabia, totaled 31
                    billion dollars. A young commercial officer said, “I'm trying to sell eggbeaters
                    here, and you are selling these AWACS systems!” But as a matter of fact we did
                    sell that.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume there was either a number of military attaches at the embassy, as
                    well as perhaps a MAAG or MIL Group. Could you sort of help us to understand how
                    you defined your job in relation to the American military that might be
                    there?</p>
                <p>MARSH: It wasn't easy. But there was a very remarkable Major General who was the
                    head of the Military Assistance Organization, Chuck Donnelly, amazing guy. Now
                    we were all widely dispersed. Jeddah is not the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh
                    is the capital. But all embassies, at that time, were confined to Jeddah, which
                    is the traditional port of arrival for pilgrims on the Hadj. So they wanted to
                    keep the contamination of foreign influences confined to post, I suppose. Later
                    on, in the '80s, there was the completion of construction of diplomatic quarters
                    in Riyadh.Similarly, the Military Assistance Headquarters were located not in
                    Riyadh, but up on the Gulf in Dhahran. Now Chuck Donnelly and I used to get
                    together very regularly in Riyadh. He would fly down in a military plane, I'd
                    fly up from Jeddah on Saudia Airlines. As a matter of fact I was going from
                    Jeddah to Riyadh at least twice a week. That would be getting up and being at
                    the airport at 6:30 in the morning for a 7:30 flight and arriving in Riyadh
                    about 10:00. Spending time with the military and seeing the Saudi officers (or
                    ministers, as the case may be, if I was with the ambassador), who generally saw
                    people about 11 or 12 in the morning, but very rarely after that, and never
                    beforehand.</p>
                <p>Then I would spend time with the military assistance people at the lower levels.
                    You don't just want to do it with the Generals. First of all he's got things to
                    do, and second of all you want to hear, as I learned in Vietnam, you want to
                    hear what the Majors and the Captains and Lieutenant Colonels think and are
                    doing and how things are going. Then I'd get a flight back and if I were lucky I
                    could be back in Jeddah by seven o'clock and if I weren't so lucky I might be
                    back in Jeddah at ten o'clock at night and get home at 11. So that would be a
                    very long day and was tiring. You never knew how to dress because in the middle
                    of the desert Riyadh could be a hundred-plus at midday and it could get down to
                    pretty chilly at night. You probably remember that from your North African
                    experiences. So you needed extra clothing and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>But we did have a Liaison Office in Riyadh and that was verhelpful. If you needed
                    to stay over you could stay over at that place.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an American military office not a State
                        Department...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, it was a State Department office. It was called USLO, the U.S. Liaison
                    Office. It was done away with, of course, when the embassy moved there.</p>
                <p>We had a huge compound for the embassy in Jeddah, now the consulate general in
                    Jeddah, and a wonderful swimming pool. It was a very strange place, living
                    there. It was very, very strange because there were no public places to speak
                    of. There were no movies, on the Saudi side, that is. Occasionally we'd see a
                    movie at the embassy or we'd rent a tape and play it in a machine. There were no
                    movies in English in a theater; no theatrical presentations of any kind.</p>
                <p>It was risky, as a matter of fact, to go out to dinner. Major General Donnelly
                    later...by the way he died a few years ago...but he became a full General and
                    served as head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, after having served as head of U.S.
                    Air Forces in East Asia. At any rate, Chuck Donnelly and a number of his staff
                    and their wives...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about getting out of the office and having
                        somrecreation in Dhahran and Jeddah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I was saying that General Donnelly, his wife, and a number of other senior
                    staff from the military and their wives were having dinner at a recently opened
                    Chinese restaurant in Dhahran when in burst a group of the religious police.
                    These are laymen who volunteer to do all this sort of enforcement of the strict
                    Wahhabi Muslim rules and they smashed up the place royally with clubs as the
                    U.S. military tried to eat their dinner!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Because there were some representations of the Buddha abouas
                    decoration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, it's a Chinese restaurant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: In a Chinese restaurant, and that was idolatry as far as these people were
                    concerned. They really smashed it to smithereens according to what Chuck wrote.
                    That was the way it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>You know, if you were in a supermarket and prayer call was called, the doors were
                    locked, the shades pulled down and the cash registers stopped working. So we
                    would have to stand there and wait and sometimes we would be there fifteen,
                    twenty minutes, standing and waiting until the end of the prayer period. And
                    then up would go the shades and the lights were turned on and the cash registers
                    resumed ringing up our purchases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't much sort of downtown in Jeddah for either
                        movies ocultural events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Nothing. No auditoriums of any kind, no theaters of any kind. As a matter
                    of fact, there was an amusement park and certain nights of the week were for
                    fathers and sons, and other nights of the week were for mothers and daughters,
                    but never for mingled families to go out. As a matter of fact, there was great
                    pressure placed by the Wahhabi religious that men and women should not be
                    allowed to dine in hotels together. The hotels said they simply could not
                    operate having split dining rooms. However, the swimming pools at the hotels had
                    set hours for men and set hours for women. Husband and wife could never swim
                    together.</p>
                <p>Q: Part of the definition of a hotel is that it is for people who don't live
                    there, so most of the hotels would be full of people who were not Saudis.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Very sorry, but it did not work that way.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, one thing I have in my notes on this period is that in 1980 while you
                    were in Jeddah, along came the Iran-Iraq War and the question of the use of U.S.
                    AWACS planes. Did you get involved in that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Let's go back a bit, there is something even more significant in 1979.
                    You'll recall that for many years journalists have been saying that the Saudi
                    monarchy and the whole system of the country is about to collapse. It has not
                    undergone modernization, democratization, representative and responsible
                    government, etc. Well, the Saudis had been listening to this, by the time we
                    were there, for a quarter of a century. They always maintained that their
                    generous system of allowances and social welfare benefits to the population
                    managed to keep everything in place. And then of course came the shock of the
                    seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.</p>
                <p>It so happened I had been there about a month. It was during the Hadj, followed
                    by the Id. A good many of the embassy had gone off with the ambassador's
                    blessing on a flight to the States that had brought pilgrims, hadji, over. It
                    was returning to the States empty and then was going to come back and fetch the
                    hadji later. So for the two empty segments of it, the airline responded to the
                    ambassador's generosity and shrewdness in having them over for a party, and
                    offered that anyone who would like to was welcome to go on the plane.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>I was too new, I mean it was unthinkable that I would go anywhere, I had been
                    there about a month. Many embassy personnel were away on that trip when I got
                    the word in the embassy from the U.S. military that the Grand Mosque had been
                    seized. This was a terrible time for the Saudis, very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Islamic militants seized it, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are sort of conservative...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Ultra, ultra, ultra...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ultra conservative, nationalistic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: You'll recall that the disinformation went around the world that the
                    United States had had a hand in the seizure of the Grand Mosque. Therefore, in
                    Islamabad, our embassy was burned. Rioting mobs killed some of our people. It
                    was a very bad time.</p>
                <p>Yes, at the time of the Iran-Iraq War, we did not have U.S. AWACS at that time.
                    They were brought in a little later, to tell you the truth. They were based in
                    Riyadh, because there would not be very much warning time if the Saudis were to
                    be attacked by Iranian forces. Remember Iran is the enemy at that time, not
                    Iraq. The threat was from Iran.</p>
                <p>The strategic lifeline, particularly vital for Japan and the East Asian economies
                    was through the Iranian Gulf straits, a very, very long lifeline. With a super
                    tanker leaving every hour for the Far East, every hour. I've been in the air and
                    I've seen this. It used to be called the string of pearls, laying out all of
                    these super tankers which are great, wallowing whales. It takes twelve miles for
                    them to come to a stop!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All heading for Japan, Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Japan, Hong Kong and so forth, oh, yes. That's right. But in any event we
                    did get the AWACS in. The Saudis were very impressed with the AWACS. They wanted
                    an AWACS. Our military presence there did not cause a great deal of dissension
                    among the populace. All of these things were very useful come the Gulf War...
                    come Desert Storm.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Q: Is there anything that you would like to tell us about the Saudi balancing act
                    between on the one hand being a proud, independent Arab country, one of the
                    leading Arab countries of the world. And on the other hand having a fairly close
                    and reasonably friendly relationship with the United States, particularly in
                    military terms.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I don't purport to be a Middle Eastern expert. I've read everything
                    I possibly could and tried to follow developments. Over the years I've talked
                    with all sides, as a matter of fact later in Geneva I was in touch with the
                    Iraqis at the Department's instruction to see how the negotiations with the
                    Iranians, presided over by the UN Secretary General, were going. So I dealt with
                    various sides of approach. I dealt for many years with the Israelis, with
                    Israeli diplomats and all that sort of thing. I consider myself a strong friend
                    of both sides, if you will. I will not be characterized, and people have tried
                    to do it, characterize me as an Israeli sympathizer or an Arab sympathizer. I
                    want reconciliation, progress and peace worked out by both sides working
                    together and this has been the name of the game for years and years and years,
                    there is nothing new about that.</p>
                <p>At the same time, one has to strike a balance, and it isn't easy, between the
                    strong interest and importance to the United States and to the country itself of
                    human rights matters and of stable, representative government. You have to
                    balance that with the particularities of the region. They have ways of doing
                    things which may not be according to our ticket, and each of the countries has
                    certain, shall we say, anomalies of either religious inspiration or of their
                    political system or their social structures, that sort of thing. We have to be
                    very careful and very discriminating in our approach to it. It is too easy to
                    say 'X' is not negotiating now or 'Y' is not controlling terrorism, or 'Z' is
                    not practicing the rule of law and justice and so forth. There are so many
                    interests at work there.</p>
                <p>Q: This is one of the things that the FBI, perhaps, is running in to in trying to
                    get to the bottom of the bombing of the Air Force apartment building a year or
                    two ago. The FBI still doesn't feel that the Saudis have been forthcoming enough
                    about their investigation, but this is an aspect of Saudi sovereignty and
                    culture.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, that is very true and furthermore there are an awful lot of things
                    that probably will not come out into the light of day for years and years to
                    come because the Saudis have done things very, very quietly in many respects.
                    And sometimes they've done things quietly which seem contradictory in order to
                    be of use to both sides. But there have always been certain things very
                    difficult to understand in the Middle East. It is a set of paradoxes, no doubt
                    about that. For example, from day one Israel had had an assured oil supply from
                    Iran. This was interrupted to a certain extent, and I say to a certain extent,
                    at the Iranian Revolution. But however arranged, though the former supplier or
                    vendor was out of operation, Israel has had a continued oil supply vital to its
                    economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>In Saudi Arabia we used to eat lettuce that purported to come from the Gaza
                    Strip. I don't believe it came from the Gaza Strip at all. I think it came from
                    Israel. So one day I put this to certain Saudi officials and they became
                    extremely uncomfortable, then coughed, so I knew I had hit on something!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about Saudi officials, any quick perceptions that
                        you'like to give us about some of the Saudis that you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I found them very impressive people, most of them I dealt with to any
                    extent. You know, the Kingdom has concentrated upon good education for its
                    princes and for as many of its people as it could.</p>
                <p>Now this tends to run counter to the extreme conservative Wahhabi trend and so
                    occasionally they have a period of re-evaluation, reconsideration, but still
                    thousands and thousands of the people have become quite well educated.</p>
                <p>Q: I would imagine that a number of the people you dealt with, for example in the
                    Foreign Ministry, would be people who had a Western education. How are they
                    managing on the one hand they've been exposed to Western culture and yet they
                    are living in this very strict and conservative environment. How are they
                    dealing with that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: They travel a great deal and what they do, when in Rome... So there has
                    been very little problem with that. Occasionally there is some argument from the
                    government about their foreign exposure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so now we are in 1981. You are up for transfer from
                        hardship post, where did you want to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, I was very eager to find... to get a chief of mission position or
                    something of that sort. I did not want to go back to Washington after only two
                    years out. I was asked to go to Morocco. That was not my first choice but then I
                    thought, well, alright. It would be interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would be going there as what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Counselor for Political Affairs. I had had senior level jobs, so I was
                    still a Three, which is not technically a senior officer. I had had senior level
                    jobs for years. I had served above my pay grade for a long, long time. I knew I
                    was going to be promoted to the senior ranks that fall and the job of counselor
                    for Political Affairs was graded at the Three level. So for the first time I was
                    going to be working below senior levels.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Now I'm going to have to be careful, very, very careful, in dealinwith the time I
                    was in Morocco because it was very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was very difficult because there was a political ambassador who tended
                    to consume the whole mission, the whole embassy, the whole staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Name, please? MARSH: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consume in what sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: He had to monopolize every activity, every talent all thtime in every
                    person. I'll give you certain examples.</p>
                <p>I could get a telephone call from the Marine Guard who would say thathe deputy
                    chief of mission...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was Ted Curran, who was a man about whom this very garrulous person
                    speaking to you now will say absolutely nothing, which is my way of indicating
                    that the gentleman deserves nothing but total silence on my part. In any event
                    the deputy chief of mission told the Marine Guard that the ambassador wanted
                    everybody in on Sunday afternoon for an urgent meeting within fifteen minutes.
                    The ambassador was a very dapper dresser all the time. So that meant coat, tie,
                    and full regalia, you see, to go over there to the residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sunday afternoon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Sunday afternoon. And so we would get over there and there would be a
                    meeting that would be eight to twelve minutes long. The ambassador would say
                    that the purpose of it was to discuss whether the ambassador from the Republic
                    of Banana in Central America should be invited to a reception two weeks
                    afterwards, because that ambassador “had not been very nice” to our
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the whole staff? On a Sunday afternoon? MARSH: The
                        whole senior staff...on Sunday afternoon at the residence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking manic compulsive-ness here!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, yes we are! We're also talking about a person who simply has to have
                    everybody's attention all the time and has to be the center of everything all
                    the time, and who spent most of the time alone in Rabat. His wife came out very
                    rarely. I can well understand why. And so he had to have somebody dancing
                    attendance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Reagan appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct. Just for curiosity afterwards I counted the number of
                    times I had been to the residence for official events during the first six
                    months of 1982. January 1 to June 30, 1982, I had been there 203 times for an
                    official event or meeting or what have you in half a year!</p>
                <p>And another time, for example, my wife, and my children (Both of the boys were
                    back from school in the States.), and I were planning to go to Fez at Christmas
                    time. At the last minute the ambassador instructed us to take along the chairman
                    of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his wife, who were going to be
                    visiting.</p>
                <p>Q: And this is a private family Christmas vacation? And here you have got the
                    Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his wife coming along
                    with you?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right, and the Senator from Illinois, Charles Percy, and his wife,
                    Lorraine! Absolutely marvelous people, wonderful people, but the ambassador
                    would lean on anybody for anything!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they want to go to Fez in the first place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, they were en route to Tunisia where they had a daughter in the Peace
                    Corps, or something, I've forgotten what exactly, something like that. But at
                    any rate, incidentally, I was never paid back. I was told to pick up the bills
                    for them and be reimbursed. I was never reimbursed for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>MARSH: Another time I was given about three hours notice in Rabat that I was to
                    fly up to London, meet the ambassador, fly back with him to Fez from London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Because there were papers he wanted translated into French and he just
                    loved my French. Well, it was the only effective French, except for the
                    administrative officer, John Garon, who was a very good administrative officer,
                    by the way, another exception. He was Corsican in origin, so he had French, but
                    he wasn't a writer of diplomatic French, but I could write French and put
                    everything before the King.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had to speak French to serve in Morocco, in
                        theory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Hah! Hah!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Every position in the embassy would have to be
                        languagdesignated, I would think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: This is terribly funny. Language requirements were largely a thing of the
                    past. Only for certain hard languages was there was somebody on hand who has
                    been especially trained for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Bill, you have been a counselor of embassy before,
                        in Jeddah, you are now serving sort of your second post as counselor of
                        embassy. You have made your promotion to Class Two. Give us some of the
                        contrast between a political-military counselor in one Arab country and a
                        straight political counselor in another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But you are missing the point. The point is not the dictateof the job; the
                    point is the dictates of the dictator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: So I wrote speeches by the carload.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right, and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Q: It does sound like sort of a one man band and everybody is dancing to his
                    tune, which is strange because I would assume he didn't know that much either
                    about diplomacy or about Morocco.</p>
                <p>MARSH: He had disdain for diplomacy and had the weirdest view of Morocco that
                    there ever was. He had a certain disregard for facts in situations. Thus he
                    maintained in his remarks at his swearing-in that when he was a child at their
                    family estate in Florida, that his nurse had said to him, “One day, you are
                    going to be ambassador to Morocco” pointing East. Well, in that case, she was
                    pointing at Senegal, not at Morocco. But in any event these things really
                    challenged one's credibility!</p>
                <p>Q: Is there anything that you would like to add about Morocco, your impressions
                    of Morocco? What life was like there?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Not really, I think I'd just as soon pass over it because finally things
                    became unbearable so I curtailed, I cut a three year tour to two years. So I
                    went back to the Department and in effect was overcomplement for most of the
                    year, but did manage to find a Special Planning assignment, and then in '84 I
                    was asked if I would go to Belgium again, this time as political counselor. The
                    name of the game was to persuade the Belgian government to permit the
                    installation of cruise missiles.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, well, why don't we take that up next time? We have now been at this for
                    about two hours. So in our next session it will be 1984, and you will be
                    counselor of embassy in Brussels, okay?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Very good, thank you.</p>
                <p>***Q: Good afternoon. It is now the afternoon of January 16th. This is Nick
                    Heyniger. I am interviewing William (Bill) Harrison Marsh, and we are now in
                    1984. Bill has accepted an assignment as counselor in Brussels.</p>
                <p>Bill, you had been in Brussels before, right?</p>
                <p>MARSH: For four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you coming back to do this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>MARSH: Well, as we said at the time, I returned to Brussels after an absence of
                    twelve years. In the course of that time I moved 12 feet from office to office,
                    and one slot, that is to say from political officer up to political counselor.
                    This describes for me, in any event, the glacial pace at which things take place
                    in the personnel system of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>At any rate, I remember distinctly when John Heyman, my predecessor, met me at
                    the airport in 1984 and we drove into Brussels, it was as if I had never left!
                    Everything just looked exactly the same, and sure enough the political
                    counselor's house I was given, was one I had helped the previous political
                    counselor find, and it was located about a half mile from where my place had
                    been the first tour. So there was a sort of sameness about it. But the
                    Department here upgraded very intelligently in my view. They wanted to build on
                    my knowledge of Belgian internal politics, and particularly of Belgian
                    politicians in order to obtain Belgian government assent to the deployment of
                    cruise missiles in Belgium.</p>
                <p>What was the importance of this? Well, the importance of it was, of course, that
                    the SS-20 threat from the Soviets in the early '80s was a very serious challenge
                    to meet. That the countries where we were go put the missiles in Europe were
                    Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands. Also Denmark, as I recall now. But the
                    Netherlands was very unready to do so. Had Belgium not assented, I think that it
                    would have been impossible for the Netherlands to say yes. In Belgium there had
                    been mammoth demonstrations against cruise missiles. At one point, for example,
                    there were about half a million demonstrators in Brussels against deployment.
                    That is a rather considerable proportion of a country of nine million people. So
                    there was a lot of work to be done.</p>
                <p>I took up the job very happily. The ambassador was a very fine man, God rest his
                    soul. He died just a matter of a few months ago, Geoffrey Swaebe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Career or political appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: President of the May Company. He was a retailer. He was actually a man
                    born in Britain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they make Maytag appliances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, no...retail...the May Company. They own Hechts, among others; the May
                    Company is in California. He had been connected with the California operations
                    and later became the CEO of the May Company. He and his wife were very, very
                    close friends of the Reagans so that every New Year's eve the Reagans had dinner
                    with the Swaebe, the Wicks...Charlie Wick was the head of USIA at that time, and
                    the six of them had dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Back in Washington or in California or wherever. That meant that the
                    embassy had access to the White House, but the thing of course that President
                    Reagan wanted from Belgium was agreement to deploy those cruise missiles. You
                    couldn't make up a nice package of other concessions and agreements and so forth
                    and say, well, we couldn't get the cruise missiles but, look here, we got
                    increased trade and we got this and we got that. Sorry, no interest in those
                    sorts of things. So we were gambling for very high stakes and we devised a
                    strategy and a campaign and we involved President Reagan himself in it. We
                    arranged for Prime Minister Wilfred Martens to call at the White House in
                    Washington. President Reagan did a really great job on him, no question about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like you were sort of the point man on this
                        particulaeffort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It is fair to say that I was, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your principal contacts in the Belgian
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: First let me explain that Prime Minister Martens, Wilfred Martens who
                    served as Prime Minister eight times, if I'm not mistaken, was the contact I had
                    made in the early '70s, a dozen years before. It had been my practice to ask the
                    Secretary General of the Christian Democratic Party who he might suggest receive
                    a Leader Grant to the United States. At one point he mentioned this fellow from
                    West Flanders who was the head of the Christian Democratic Youth in that
                    province. West Flanders is pretty much an agricultural province. He said this
                    would help his career, if he could get a Leader Grant. So I arranged for Wilfrid
                    Martens to go to the United States. Frank Swaelen, the Secretary General, who
                    later became Minister of Defense in Belgium by the way, and a long time member
                    of the Chamber and later of the Senate in Belgium, Frank Swaelen said the cachet
                    of this visit helped make his, Martens', career. So I knew Party officials. I
                    knew a number of Ministers</p>
                <p>Of course we had a little problem here and that is that it is thambassador who is
                    supposed to see the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, political counselors don't usually hobnob with
                        ministers anprime ministers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That is absolutely true. But I was doing a little bit of Geppetto...just
                    call me Geppetto, the marionette master; I was doing a little string pulling
                    there and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your DCM? How did he or she feel about
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: My DCM was Charlie Thomas, later ambassador to Hungary, was a wonderful,
                    wonderful man, a great boss. I really enjoyed working with him. But at any rate
                    through the two of them we managed to do things. My principal work was with
                    political parties. I helped them on their work with the ministers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you helped 'them' you mean the DCM and
                        thambassador in their contacts with the Belgians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct. But I worked on political parties, the trade unions and so
                    forth directly. I had a good Labor attach�. I had him all programmed. I had a
                    good man for internal politics. I had him all programmed. We just started up a
                    relentless campaign on our Belgian counterparts.</p>
                <p>Well, I made a big mistake. I got this done too soon! Within a year we had
                    Belgian assent. Some had thought it would take several years. Then the question
                    is what do you do for the balance of the three-year assignment? I'm afraid the
                    answer was not much.</p>
                <p>Q: Again, this is sort of the question that you faced before both in the field
                    and in Washington as a deputy office director of sort of what exactly is your
                    niche? What exactly are your responsibilities?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. This is one of the problems of the rising Foreign Service officer,
                    but more particularly it is the problem of officers in the political cone. At
                    this point I would like to digress briefly in order to say that I think the
                    political cone is the essential cone of American diplomacy and in fact what
                    distinguishes diplomacy from other fields. For a long time I think we deluded
                    ourselves that we were really going to develop an economic cadre which would
                    rival the domestic agencies of the United States. To wield an economic
                    expertise, that would give us a great deal of prestige and power. I think that
                    this has largely failed to come about.</p>
                <p>Why? It is because we simply cannot rival Treasury or Agriculture or others in
                    their economic pursuits. But when it comes to the political function the problem
                    is that we have more expertise in that than any of the technical ministries in
                    the U.S. government. In our democracy, in any event, everyone imagines himself a
                    political expert. So that political appointees who come in from some where, who
                    knows, out in the provinces, never having worked in government before, believe
                    that they are uniquely endowed to attack and approach the political questions
                    involved, and the policy questions of course, involved in a relationship with a
                    foreign power. Time and again these people see the matter as one of personal
                    relationships. They imagine a personal relationship with the President of the
                    United States, which simply isn't there.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>After all, the President has very, very limited time, indeed, for foreign affairs
                    at all. It is very hard to imagine that he has very much time at all for dealing
                    with a lesser bilateral question of some sort. I have not seen many instances
                    when political appointees are able to work a policy turn-around or a policy
                    change, even those very close to the President.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, did I also sort of sense that you were saying perhaps that sort of the
                    preponderant expertise in the Department and in the Career Foreign Service, at
                    least when you or I were in it, was in sort of in the political cone. We had
                    really sort of more political officers, particularly senior political officers,
                    than we really could use. Therefore one thing to do might be to sort of
                    sub-divide that cone up with perhaps some political officers having sort of
                    global responsibilities, things like disarmament or drugs or the environment.
                    Did I get that correctly?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Frankly, I don't know whether there is a way that we can meet the
                    requirements by fitting applicants for a particular job assignment, whether you
                    can develop an expertise and then wield it or not. I think we have, as a matter
                    of fact, balkanized the political cone entirely too much. We have specialization
                    galore. Then these people set up their own bureaucracies. Take the labor
                    function, for example. In a country like Belgium where two-thirds of the labor
                    force is unionized, the Labor attach� serves a certain function. There is no
                    question about that.</p>
                <p>In France the Labor attach� has a distinct meaning because there you have
                    definite contention between communist, socialist, conservative trade unions, and
                    so forth. In certain Third World countries, the same. But we keep carving more
                    and more little icebergs off the main mass. I think this is a very unhealthy
                    thing. At the same time, a political counselor who really should be primus inter
                    pares at the ambassador's conference table has to contend with the economic,
                    information, military, and what not specializations. I think we have had some
                    success and a lot of failures and disappointments in any event with that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>I remember one time I was considering applying to become DCM in Budapest and
                    found out that there was something like five persons with Hungarian language
                    qualifications, in the right grade, who were interested in the job. I think
                    there is a limit to what we can do and so what we need to do is have some people
                    double and triple jointed, or else we are going to trip over ourselves in that
                    kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in sort of the middle and upper grades there are more
                        gooofficers than really interesting positions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Very clearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Plus the fact that doesn't the Department of Labor
                        itselnominate a good number of labor officers? They used to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I think that sometimes it does. But all the Labor attaches have met have
                    been FSOs, career FSOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Labor attach� in Brussels was an FSO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Just to digress for a second, but the reverse happened to us while I was
                    serving at the American embassy in The Hague. We had an excellent team but we
                    kind of overlooked labor reporting. We didn't do enough of it and we didn't
                    cultivate enough contacts. I was the most junior officer in the Political
                    Section. This is back in 1960. We didn't have enough knowledge of what was going
                    on in the Dutch Labor Movement, and the result of that was that shortly after I
                    left the Labor Department stepped in. They said they needed their own reporting
                    officer in The Hague and sent over a Labor Department officer to be the Labor
                    attach� a position- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>This is the continuation of an interview with Bill Marsh. Bill is political
                    counselor in Brussels. Go ahead. What did you do for the next two years?</p>
                <p>MARSH: We had a little homily there about the role of a political officer and all
                    that sort of thing. I would like to tie it back in by saying that apart from the
                    Political Section, the political cone, the political people, there are very few
                    people who have to deal with crises.</p>
                <p>In the Economic Cone there are just not that many crises, that many critical
                    developments abroad that occur. I mean, in Hong Kong today, for example, you
                    wouldn't be rushing around to figure which bank was going to collapse, you'd
                    wait until it came out in the newspaper. And then it probably would have been
                    reported home in any event.</p>
                <p>Apart from the crises that every embassy had, namely of escorting a myriad of
                    visitors around and seeing they got to their appointments and that sort of
                    thing, but even that falls heaviest upon a Political Section.</p>
                <p>Well, first of all we had bare bones staffing. So the political counselor, from
                    1984 to 1987, had to act as substitute teacher a tremendous amount of time. When
                    ever anybody got sick, or went on home leave or went on annual leave, why, the
                    political counselor had to fall right in and deal with it. So it went. But the
                    point is that we had had a prime national security concern about the cruise
                    missiles. When that question was resolved very satisfactorily and
                    congratulations had been passed out all around and so forth, what then did
                    Washington want from us?</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>The answer to that was a very hard thing to find out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Nothing in particular.</p>
                <p>Q: Bill, you are an intelligent and reasonably ambitious FSO. Maybe you'd like to
                    say something here about the next stage, which is sort of becoming a deputy
                    chief of mission. I wonder if you'd like to say anything here about the quest to
                    become a DCM. Would you have been willing to go to Africa, let's say, or a small
                    post in Latin America, to be DCM? How does that work? What was your
                    experience?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Before that time I had tried very hard to find a DCMship. I think it might
                    be appropriate to move back just a little bit in time and make an explanation
                    here. As one who had spent many years in Vietnam affairs, and had stayed in the
                    Foreign Service, I felt I was somewhat stigmatized during the Carter
                    Administration. The Department had a number of key figures who had been in
                    Vietnam with me and who had left the government. Some who were in open
                    disagreement on Vietnam policy and others for other reasons. But they had
                    certainly become associated with what was clearly a revisionist administration
                    concerning Vietnam. It was not going to take the old policy attitudes and
                    standpoints and accept them. Particularly in staffing of the NSC and at senior
                    levels of the Department, there were revisionists about Vietnam. So I was
                    regarded as a Loyalist in that tribe. I inquired about certain jobs and did not
                    get them, but had the distinct feeling that my credentials were considered
                    shadowy to a certain extent.</p>
                <p>The search to get a DCM-ship was a very tough one. Another thing we should
                    remember is that the Department's own research indicates that about 65 percent
                    of DCM-ships fail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes that is right. It is an intensely personal relationship between an FSO
                    and either another FSO, and God knows FSOs can be very difficult to work for, or
                    a political appointee. This research that was done, to my best recollection, in
                    sort of the late '80s and it was that 65 percent of DCM-ships were considered to
                    be failures.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>I know there was one ambassador to a Scandinavian country who had four DCMs
                    during his two or three years tour in that post. I know there was another
                    political appointee who decided that he would have a rotating DCM-ship. So he
                    had a DCM of the month program! He was allowed to do these sorts of things. I
                    remember when there was an ambassador who was very much taken with his political
                    counselor. This is some years ago, lest some people decide to do a little
                    detective work here. This is some years ago. But the two used to travel around
                    together, sharing hotel rooms and all that sort of thing. I wonder how the DCM
                    would have dealt with that little problem, for goodness sakes! But since
                    DCM-ships are generally regarded as the way to chiefs of mission jobs, it is
                    very difficult to get the right one. And to have a DCM-ship at a small African
                    or Latin American post doesn't seem that much ice, these days. You still have to
                    work the Washington scene.</p>
                <p>If I had my entire career to recast, I believe I would have taken fewer overseas
                    posts and would have worked harder not to take assignments in Washington that
                    the Department wanted, only to get myself up against personalities who could
                    have dealt me out. I think that is the way that it is done. I think I was a bit
                    na�ve in saying, “You run that flag up the flagpole, sir, and I'll salute it
                    wherever it leads” and where the services are needed, Marsh will be found to
                    help fill them. That's not really the way that it is done.</p>
                <p>Now how did I get the DCM-ship in Geneva? I would like to say that apart from
                    routine demarches, for example the annual one concerning General Assembly
                    issues, etc., for the two remaining years that I had in Brussels I don't
                    remember a unique, specific instruction coming from the Department on which the
                    Political Section had to act. Everything else was routine demarches. In short
                    what I'm saying is that we had an exciting first year and quite ho-hum for the
                    two years to follow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So now we are in 1987 and you are coming up
                        foreassignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I'm coming up for reassignment. I've been in Brussels for three years. So
                    that means seven years in all that I've spent in Brussels.</p>
                <p>Q: It's a little bit out of cycle, but maybe it's in cycle with your coming in
                    from Rabat? What I'm saying is that normally a Western European tour is four
                    years.</p>

                <p>MARSH: No, that had changed, that had changed. One of the little tricks of the
                    trade here that are going by us very quietly is that in its constant attempt to
                    save money.... By the way nobody spends more money trying to find ways to save
                    money than the Department of State. It is absolutely incredible. I remember when
                    a number of Western European ambassadors were called in by Secretary Shultz to
                    discuss ways to achieve greater economy and so forth, some of these chiefs of
                    mission decided to save time and everything by taking the Concorde into
                    Washington from London. That is first class plus one-third! These souls, bless
                    them, just didn't understand, and just didn't grasp it.</p>
                <p>I remember an ambassador, a political appointee for whom I worked, who wanted a
                    ten thousand-dollar laser copier. When I told him we really couldn't spend more
                    than a hundred dollars, one hundred dollars, without referring it to Washington,
                    I'll never forget the blank stare and the open mouth with which he received this
                    information!</p>
                <p>So I sought a DCM-ship. Now I want to point out at this time that having come
                    into the Foreign Service at 29, I was aware I was getting a bit long in the
                    tooth at never having had a DCM-ship. But fortunately at 56, I did manage to get
                    one, and with the help of Ambassador Swain. He had been permanent representative
                    in Geneva before going to Brussels and he knew that the new ambassador in Geneva
                    was looking for a DCM. He very kindly put in a good word for me and I credit his
                    intervention, bless him, with my getting that job. Plus the fact that my wife
                    and the new ambassador's wife were both Smith alumnae, so the old girl network
                    here, if I may be so bold as to say, helped out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the new ambassador in Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, okay. So here you are now in Geneva. I guess this is
                        onof your first experiences with multilateral diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Not exactly because while serving in the Paris quadrilateral talks on
                    Vietnam, I had been in Geneva in 1974 in a Vietnam effort, a humanitarian law
                    conference, and I handled the credentials fight concerning which South
                    Vietnamese party to admit to the conference, the government of Vietnam or the
                    Vietcong. I won that by what became known as Marsh's landslide, 38 to 37, in
                    favor of the Government of Vietnam. There was general rejoicing over this
                    outcome.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>Just before going to Geneva, in 1987, however, I got somewhat involved in the
                    crossfire between the then ambassador to Switzerland and the then Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs together with the then Director General of the
                    Foreign Service. The then Ambassador to Switzerland was looking for a deputy
                    chief of mission, and wanted a certain person who had worked for the ambassador
                    before. The Department would not allow it. There was a feud between the
                    Department and the ambassador on certain other matters. I went to Bern and
                    received very, very cold treatment from the ambassador who told me that the
                    recommendation of me by the Assistant Secretary and the Director General was
                    hardly something in my favor. So I wasn't quite sure what to make of that.</p>
                <p>But the previous January, again serendipity plays a great role in things, I was
                    awhile in Washington briefly due to a family emergency, I had stopped in and
                    talked with Ambassador Joseph Carlton Petrone, the newly appointed permanent
                    representative in Geneva, and his wife. I was the first person out of 24 that
                    Petrone interviewed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That Petrone had seen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct. Let me digress here, I am informed that a score or two
                    dozen applicants for a DCM-ship is not an unusual thing. What one can do, of
                    course, is waste an awful lot of one's time in races in which you really have no
                    horse and that there should be a much better arrangement for the selection
                    process.</p>
                <p>I would like to bring this up to the present, by the way, because in 1994, early
                    1994, to my astonishment I saw that in Rome, where I was permanent
                    representative at that time, there were over 50 officers who had bid for the job
                    as my deputy. Now obviously my incredible personality and great reputation would
                    make every Foreign Service officer want to work for me, but I think Rome may
                    have had something to do with it, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But when you've got an army of people applying for something of that sort,
                    this is really just not very fair. It is not very efficient. I think the
                    Department needs to establish more criteria, marked guidelines and so forth and
                    I don't just mean language proficiency but certain kinds of experience and this
                    and that and the other thing for these jobs. It would cut down on the waste of
                    time for the individuals and the system for all these applicants, nine-tenths of
                    whom have no chance whatever of getting the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>I noticed that there were perhaps a dozen or two dozen people who just wanted to
                    get a European tour. Had no service in Europe and multilateral organizations,
                    what have you, anything to do with it. So, to return to 1987, I go to Geneva and
                    had two very fine years with Ambassador and Mrs. Petrone. She was very active,
                    shared fully with her husband. My wife and I worked very, very hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Active in what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, in the first place the ambassador wanted to improve relations
                    between the diplomatic corps at Geneva and the leadership of the international
                    organizations in Geneva and the U.S. mission. The ambassador's predecessor had
                    been a person who had had an extremely unsuccessful stay there and matters had
                    deteriorated greatly. So he wanted to work to repair things. And in particular
                    the ambassador wanted to use the function of representation at his residence. My
                    wife and I attended every function that he gave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a load.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was quite a load. But it was nothing compared with the Rabat experience
                    where I think I mentioned we had 203 engagements at the residence in 180 days.
                    It wasn't mere quantity and mere volume but it was qualitative and in the
                    service of the many, many delegations we had come through. We did have, I think,
                    four visits by Secretary Shultz.</p>
                <p>Then I had a second ambassador who wanted to deal with substance and
                    representation was nothing he found particularly friendly. In particular he
                    wanted to deal with the human rights questions.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: That was Ambassador Morris Abram who was a noted New York Attorney. He had
                    been President of the Council of Presidents of Major Jewish organizations in the
                    States. So two very different approaches these people had. But my wife and I
                    worked extremely hard. It is fair to say that ninety plus percent of the time we
                    were out every night Monday through Thursday, or we were hosts ourselves. We had
                    thousands, literally thousands, of people to our house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. Wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>MARSH: I have to give you one little anecdote because it tells you something of
                    the approach that we had. Through various complications and shenanigans, the DCM
                    residence had been lost and it was necessary to find a place for us to reside in
                    Geneva. Now my predecessor had had an interesting apartment, not terribly far
                    from the mission, but hopelessly small. To such an extent that General Services
                    had to come over every time he gave a reception to move the furniture from his
                    living room and dining room and put it in the back and so forth. And there was
                    no way to let anybody in at the door below on the street because there was no
                    buzzer system or something of that sort. So there had to be somebody stationed
                    there. We found this terribly inconvenient.</p>
                <p>We came in advance, in April, for a look-see. We stayed with my predecessor and
                    his wife in the apartment and they were very kind. They had a wonderful outdoor
                    terrace that faced the lake and the Alps. It was just out of this world. But in
                    the wintertime you wouldn't get a great deal of use out of the outdoor terrace,
                    I don't think. So we had General Services look around and find us a place.</p>
                <p>They found us this glorious apartment. This apartment was on the other side of
                    the lake and therefore was facing West, facing the mountains, but it was
                    overlooking the lake and the little sailboat basin that was there in Geneva. It
                    was marvelous so we were thrilled to death. Well, Washington turned it down and
                    the reason was that it was too big. We didn't know what too big meant, but some
                    guidelines had just come in very recently which would allow a certain amount of
                    square feet. Now I told you we had thousands, literally thousands, of people in
                    over the three years at our place on official business. Well, they found us a
                    very nice place and it was considerably smaller and considerably more expensive,
                    and six miles out of town, not on the West Side, not overlooking the lake. So
                    this was approved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though it was more expensive? Doesn't make
                        sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Of course it doesn't make sense but these sorts of people...wait, I'm not
                    through. ACDA had given a sum of money, $50,000 to be exact. They had not looked
                    properly after the furniture that had been in the DCM's residence. ACDA had
                    taken over that DCM's residence, and its furniture and they had all but
                    frittered it away and couldn't account for it and so forth. So they paid an
                    indemnity to the embassy of $50,000 to buy furniture for the new DCM's
                    place.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>I had wind of this when I came back to go to the DCM course in June of 1987. It
                    is held in West Virginia and at FSI. At that time I went in to see the interior
                    decorators of FBO. I arranged to talk with this lovely lady and we went out for
                    coffee or something of that sort and we talked. I said my wife was very
                    interested in helping and had done a wonderful job with the GSO in Rabat when
                    they completely redecorated and refurbished the political counselor's residence
                    there. They had done it very economically and beautifully and it was stunning.
                    At any rate we come to Geneva and find out that the dear lady, the interior
                    decorator, has already come and has gone to the most expensive antiquarian on
                    the lake there in Geneva and has bought Louis Philippe originals and Napoleonic
                    originals, all of that kind of thing. The one I particularly liked very much was
                    the $3,000 chandelier for the dining room.</p>
                <p>Q: This is in a rented apartment?</p>
                <p>MARSH: A rented house. That's right. So she has bought all these lovely, nifty
                    things for us and there is no money left. So we had no beds, no dressers; we
                    have nothing for the family quarters. And we have a room on the ground floor,
                    just off the living room, a library, with no furniture for it. So we have to
                    send for our stuff, which has been put in storage in Antwerp and they send that
                    to us. We pick out of it the things that we need for our house, we put it back
                    in, and it is shipped back to Antwerp. Considerably later we find how much
                    breakage has been involved in our things due to this packing, shipping,
                    unpacking, re-packing, shipping and then ultimately shipping back to Washington
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>I'm suggesting that there are procedures and policies and people who need a lot
                    of careful scrutiny because screwy things happen. Now my administrative
                    counselor in Geneva who had been privy to all of this I fired, by persuading him
                    that I was going to make him an offer that he could not resist, namely early
                    retirement. And he took it, sensibly enough.</p>
                <p>At any rate it was very difficult getting established. One thing that a DCM
                    believes is that he is going to move into a fully furnished place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure...a DCM in Western Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And you know about two days after arriving he is going to give his first
                    dinner party and that sort of thing and so forth. Well, we arrived in July and
                    our house was completely set up in November, by November. So we did do some
                    entertaining in the meantime because we did have that little tiny apartment that
                    I told you about.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>I want to say that one of the strange things to me about the way we structure
                    things in the Foreign Service and the Department is this. Whereas we make a
                    specialty of trade negotiations or labor relations or scientific affairs and so
                    forth we have no specialization whatsoever for multilateral diplomacy. So very
                    few people have had any experience with it at all. You really need it because
                    first of all it is physically exhausting...the representation, the demarches to
                    be made, just keeping tabs on things, just programming your people
                    appropriately, and so forth. For example, we had a major conference every month,
                    except December. We had eleven major conferences going on, minimum, and
                    sometimes we had even more than one a month. We would have delegations sent and
                    each such delegation thought that it was unique, that its requirements
                    superseded all other matters, and so forth. It was really and truly
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <p>I want to say that I arrive in July, about the 7th, in 1987, and about three
                    weeks later Ambassador Petrone and his wife went to England for a month. And so
                    I was charg� after having been there only three weeks. The first thing to deal
                    with was an Air Afrique airliner that was hijacked to Geneva, and we had our
                    hands full. The next thing I know is that I'm told by Washington that I am to
                    follow the Iraq-Iran Peace Talks that are being held under the aegis of the
                    Secretary General of the United Nations. The Bureau of International
                    Organizations called me up and said I should give this top priority. I said to
                    wait a minute, I was charg� d'affaires and was running the place. All of these
                    instructions that came in said to go see the head of the World Health
                    Organization, go see to this, go see to that, what am I supposed to do about all
                    these? They mumbled in effect don't bother us.</p>
                <p>So I sent in a daily cable that was based on seeing Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
                    and seeing the British, because the British could see the Iranians, whom they
                    recognized and we didn't. So the British DCM and I would compare notes and I
                    would learn what they'd find out from the Iranians, pass on what I had found out
                    from Tariq Aziz and so forth and also deal with the Secretary General's special
                    representative for the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't Suk Moon by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, it was an Italian, Giandomenico Pico. He got an award from the U.S.
                    government, a northern Italian of about 6' 5” tall, a very slim guy who ran
                    about six miles a day and worked about twenty hours a day, amazing.</p>
                <p>At any rate, there was all this work, an enormous amount of work. Plus I got new
                    people arriving who have to be oriented, I'm trying to make all my introductory
                    calls and so forth. What I want to say is that, given a workload like that, it
                    is amazing to me that we don't make more of an effort to develop people with
                    multilateral proficiency who know how to work an entire hall full of
                    delegations. I'm talking about keeping in touch with, rather close touch, with
                    between thirty and fifty delegations at a time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean sort of an occupational cone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Something of that sort. They give a very short course over at FSI, about a
                    week long, on multilateral diplomacy and really you need people to be studying
                    UN affairs and other matters at a university for a year, is what I'm saying.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just at a luncheon where the new director general of the Foreign
                    Service, Gnehm, this is one of the things he talked about. Of course now we have
                    a Secretary of State and a director general of the Foreign Service, both whose
                    immediate previous experiences have been at the UN. Gnehm was Secretary
                    Albright's deputy. So hopefully we may see more emphasis now on these sort of
                    multilateral needs.</p>
                <p>MARSH: I would submit something else as well, and that is that people in the
                    field of multilateral diplomacy also need very strong grounding and practice in
                    congressional relations. Because if you don't have the money for the dues, you
                    are not going to be effective in the club! It is as simple as that and everybody
                    knows it.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay.</p>
                <p>MARSH: Now, what did we spend a lot of our time doing? We frustrated the PLO
                    because we kept them from full membership in a number of organizations of the
                    UN. I think that helped to frustrate a diversionary effort by the PLO, kidding
                    itself it could pretend to statehood, develop it by degrees as it were rather
                    than through negotiation with Israel. So I think this was useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were what...an NGO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, they actually had certain observer status in Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what were you out to defeat or to frustrate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Their accession to full membership as a state.</p>
                <p>We had many visits from the Secretary of State, that is, from Mr. Shultz, who was
                    a wonderful man. I was very deeply impressed by him. He had so much decency and
                    humanity in spite of the crushing burdens of his office. It was really
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Then we had the job of interagency relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that is another whole can of worms!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many agencies had people in Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, we had a problem every year because we had a rather large delegation
                    come in for the UN Human Rights Commission. The name of the game was to obtain a
                    Resolution condemning Cuba for its violations of human rights. We had a Cuban
                    poet who had been a prisoner for many years and who had been freed at the behest
                    of President Mitterrand of France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: His name was Ramon Valadares. He spoke no English, but we are something of
                    a bilingual country, I guess, at any rate it wasn't a particular problem, as you
                    know, and the draft resolution had been given very high, very, very high
                    importance by the White House.</p>
                <p>Well, we had a number of delegations reporting to the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency, ACDA, coming through. At the time ACDA had two thirds of the
                    space in the U.S. mission and used it episodically, not continuously. So I
                    conferred with Ambassador Abram and said we had a problem because we needed a
                    certain number of offices.</p>
                <p>We always had problems getting space for human rights delegations, which meant
                    for six to seven weeks, including preparatory time. I recommended to the
                    ambassador that we advise ACDA well in advance that we needed 'X' number of
                    offices for the Human Rights Delegation between such and such a dates. So he
                    said that that made sense. I warned him, however, that this would not be a
                    cost-free exercise, for there would be a great deal of opposition because of the
                    very proprietary attitude of ACDA, having been handed over two thirds of the
                    mission...that is not a guess, two thirds, we measured. They had been given two
                    thirds of the total mission building there in Geneva. They felt they had a right
                    forever and a day to such terms. The ambassador, good for him, bless his heart,
                    said to go ahead.</p>
                <p>So we sent word to please schedule their delegations so that they would not need
                    'X' number of offices on the fifth floor at such and such a time, between the
                    dates of such and such, and we did this, as I recall in August. We were talking
                    about the following January. Next thing I know I have the director of ACDA on
                    the phone asking me why I am trying to sabotage the President's arms control
                    policy! I said I was not trying to do any such thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>I said I knew that one particular delegation of ACDA that had been occasionally
                    using these offices scheduled them to be used by agreement with its Soviet
                    counterparts. I asked if they could just arrange to have this done before or
                    done after the human rights session because that particular arms control
                    delegation only came three or four times a year, maybe for a couple of weeks
                    each time. These offices normally stood empty.</p>
                <p>Well, next thing we know, Under Secretary Eagleburger is sending a group of
                    inspectors out to find out what this is all about! Talk about an El Nino in a
                    teacup! But it just tells you how difficult it is for State to assume even a
                    very reasonable management of foreign relations, in such a fragmented and
                    balkanized policy context. I think it was ridiculous and it ended up costing a
                    lot of money. You send three people out for five days or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So ACDA wanted its space whenever it wanted it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right, and nobody else was to touch that space even though it lay
                    unused for something like three quarters of the time. They lost on that one,
                    incidentally, Valadares and company did come out, and we did get the Resolution
                    on Cuba. So that was very fine. That worked out very well.</p>
                <p>Of course, Cuba was a matter that had much more domestic political resonance in
                    1990 than did arms control because the Soviet Union was in full disintegration
                    by then.</p>
                <p>Q: So you found that a lot of your tour in Geneva as deputy permrep [permanent
                    representative] really was dealing with either administrative or sort of
                    representational duties?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I would just say that it was a very big point and there were very ample
                    servings of all sorts of things on that very big plate. I did mention the
                    numerous consultations. For one thing, the American deputy permrep [permanent
                    representative] is co-chairman of the Geneva Group, which is the 13 principal
                    Western members, the industrial members or OECD Group it is called in some
                    places, of the United Nations. Russia later became a member. This work of
                    consultation was very demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you had adequate staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, certainly not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again you were sort of filling in behind people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. For one thing I was astonished to find out that yet one more time
                    that proficiency in French is a great rarity in the Foreign Service. Even if
                    people could speak it, they clam up completely when it comes to writing it. And
                    if you have to write something, you had to deal with that sort of thing.
                    Certainly there was not anyone who could take a distinguished visitor and
                    interpret for that person with a French speaker in Geneva. There are still
                    plenty of people who don't speak English in Geneva.</p>
                <p>I had a political counselor who came, the Department's choice, not mine. This
                    person did not meet the language requirement, but pledged to learn French and
                    never took lesson one. That's not all of it. I handled all the representation
                    funds from the beginning, because I had a very active first ambassador who was
                    spending money at a good clip and I wanted to know how much we had left on a
                    current basis. So everything was channeled through me, with his agreement, and
                    then we just kept that arrangement when this second ambassador arrived. To my
                    astonishment I realized one day that this new political counselor had not spent
                    cent one on representation. I called the person in and at that point the
                    counselor said that no, there had been no representation done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: As a matter of fact in the whole course of the year there wano
                    representation performed by that political counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He just didn't feel like it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: The person just really offered no explanation whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you are the deputy permrep [permanent
                        representative], whadid you tell him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: I told the person what you would expect. I always had periodic reviews
                    with my officers, usually quarterly. I would give them a written piece of paper
                    with the key things that I found concerning their performance and so forth and
                    so on. In this way it helped me prepare for writing efficiency reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else, Bill, that you'd like to add about
                        Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was a fascinating assignment, but again, exhausting. I did take the
                    minimum home leave and no other leave in three years, no annual leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good grief! Your ambassador is going off to New England
                        for month? No climbing, no hiking in the Bernese Oberland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: My friend, let me tell you something. My ambassador goes off for a month,
                    comes back, and is in every single day thereafter! He needed me. Not Sundays. He
                    didn't come in Sundays. But he was in there every day of the week and he needed
                    me. I wanted to be available to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was hard on your family, hard on your wife and
                        children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: That's really too bad in a place like Geneva where you would think so much of
                    the work, petty as it is, is sort of programmable and recognizable so that you
                    could sort of organize and staff for it.</p>
                <p>MARSH: There is a problem here in that people are often reluctant to take
                    assignments in multilateral diplomacy because they do not want to leave the
                    jurisdiction of a geographic bureau. They want, in other words, to maintain
                    their ties and connections with a given geographic bureau with the hopes of
                    getting assignments within that bureau's competence later on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes. Well, of course, that was probably in an effort tcreate the
                    maximum chaos for which he alone could create...</p>
                <p>Q: ...his own Kissingeresque orders! Okay so now you are reassigned back to

                    but same church?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, something like that. Also, I am waiting out the timuntil I can
                    succeed Jerry Monroe as Permanent Representative in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what you wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It was understood.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back, I pushed you much too fast. You had an
                        idea, ainterest while you were still in Geneva in going over to Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes, I did. Partly because it was Rome and partly because of the subject
                    matter and partly because the Food and Agricultural Organization had the worst
                    reputation of any specialized agency in the United Nations. Because I had helped
                    the reform movement in the Geneva Group I mentioned there in Geneva, in which we
                    tried to achieve budgetary sanity and transparency and accountability in all of
                    the UN agencies there and elsewhere I returned and was assisting the Assistant
                    Secretary. It was John Bolton, who was a remarkable fellow. Many considered him
                    very acerbic. I considered him as very purposeful and very effective. He was
                    always very decent to me so I had no complaints at all.</p>
                <p>I was thrown immediately into work at Rome on a TDY basis to work a divorce
                    between the World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization. So I
                    went to Rome I think seven times in two years. I went to London twice, because I
                    went to the International Maritime Organization to try to work the way out of
                    some thickets there that had developed. Then in addition I was given the job of
                    obtaining success for the candidacy of Catherine Bertini to head the World Food
                    Program, to become its Executive Director.</p>
                <p>The World Food Program has been something of a sleeper in the UN system. It
                    hasn't had very high visibility, but there have been years in which we've given
                    it more than a billion dollars altogether for its emergency feeding, for its
                    developmental programs, for its refugee assistance programs and all that sort of
                    thing. So it is very important to the United States both in terms of
                    humanitarian affairs and its high political objectives.</p>
                <p>I was told that I was to work single-handedly to get endorsements from UN member
                    countries, particularly those associated with the World Food Program, so that
                    Catherine Bertini would be named to head it. She had had no international
                    experience but had been Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Food and
                    Nutrition, and in particular for food stamps in the United States, where she had
                    run, incidentally, something like a 26 billion-dollar program. So it was a great
                    deal of work. I sent out 175 telegrams, made innumerable phone calls and finally
                    ended up getting 75, 76 endorsements which prevailed therefore on a very
                    reluctant Director General of the FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization], and a
                    sometimes ambivalent Secretary General of the UN, to name her. There is not an
                    election. The head of the World Food Organization is named by the UN and the FAO
                    acting together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there is a lot of sort of behind the scenes
                        diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, yes. I went to conferences at Copenhagen, Nairobi, and a number of
                    other places. It was very exciting. I did a lot of traveling that time and then
                    in 1992 went to Rome, this time as Permanent Rep.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>Q: Tell us a little bit about why you wanted to go to Rome. Had you now sort of
                    developed a really keen interest in multilateral affairs? Or was there something
                    particular that you wanted to accomplish in Rome?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, there was the effort to revitalize and reform the FAO. I had that in
                    Rome and I had already worked at that and achieved a certain reputation for what
                    I was able to do with it. And, yes, I did like multilateral diplomacy though it
                    was a lot of work, a lot of work. Then I wanted to be a chief of mission and
                    whereas in the '83-'84 period good friends had sort of wafted the notion of an
                    African embassy past me, I didn't want it. I didn't want it for family reasons,
                    I didn't want it for substantive reasons and I didn't want it for tombstone
                    reasons.Tombstone reasons...I know too many people who have had an African
                    embassy and zip afterwards. Therefore I didn't want to be out and defacto dead
                    at that time. I wanted to work right up until age 65, when I would retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometime after I retired did the Department increase
                        thretirement age from 60 to 65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, the Act of 1980 increased it from 60 to 65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So, you were chief of mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the title or rank of ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No, they had taken that away when my predecessor was named athe post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a disappointment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: They apparently saved something like $900,000 a year by doing away with an
                    ambassador's residence, a DCM-ship and the ORE that goes along with those. They
                    saved that money. But, again, everything has been driven in recent years by
                    money, money, and money...the lack of it and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>But at any rate I had two years in Rome, not three. John Bolton was succeeded by
                    a new Assistant Secretary whom I found entirely unsympathetic and who found me
                    entirely unsympathetic, and one who had no interest whatsoever in reforming the
                    FAO, then headed by perhaps the biggest scoundrel in the history of United
                    Nations organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That was Edouard Saouma, the director general of the FAO. He was a man who
                    was corrupt in every sense of the word but whom the assistant secretary decided
                    needed to be befriended. So I served my time, having been elected to the Finance
                    Committee of the FAO, having served as co-chairman of the Geneva Group again,
                    having been elected as head of the OECD Group there, and having been considered
                    a very effective and well-liked American permanent representative. I am happy to
                    say that when I visited Rome again, after having left in September of 1994, when
                    I visited Rome in October of 1997, they did everything but spread their coats in
                    the streets for me, and greet me with hosannas and applause! I knew that I had
                    been very successful. I had received 27 letters in 1994 from foreign colleagues
                    expressing regrets at my departure and so forth, which I have carefully
                    saved.</p>
                <p>Changes of administration can be very difficult things. Occasionally you will get
                    people who are completely unsuited to the job. One of them was my ambassador to
                    Morocco and I curtailed. The second and final one was the Assistant Secretary
                    for International Organization Affairs and I curtailed.</p>
                <p>I came back to the Historical Division and spent a very pleasant year and three
                    quarters, largely working at the CIA and at the Eisenhower and Truman Libraries.
                    Largely compiling documents for the Foreign Relations of the United States
                    series that dealt with extraordinary operations and clandestine operations of
                    the United States. That is to say the overthrow of Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954
                    and the restoration of the Shah in 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. Not, interestingly enough, Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: No. It's very interesting. I reviewed the volumes for 1964 and 1965, four
                    volumes in all, two each for each year, on Vietnam. I made a number of
                    suggestions and they just sank like a stone. Everybody's mind is made up on
                    Vietnam. Nobody is of an open mind concerning it. Even when you suggest such a
                    simple thing as putting maps in the first volumes and putting some bit of
                    military information there to discuss the buildup and the fortunes of major U.S.
                    military operations within Vietnam. Historians are not prepared to listen to
                    that. Their minds are made up.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, now with your agreement I would like to ask you two things. Number one,
                    I would like to take you back to Rome when you were the perm rep [permanent
                    representative] there and ask you if you could give us perhaps just two or three
                    of the highlights of your two year tour there. Sort of important things that you
                    thought were going on and your were working on there.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>MARSH: For one thing is the extension of the World Food Program's activities to
                    cover humanitarian crises such as Somalia, Rwanda, Central Africa and that sort
                    of thing. I think matters of extreme human urgency. Secondly as I mentioned, the
                    very uphill Himalayan struggle to reform the FAO itself which is an organization
                    very largely out of tune and out of pace with the crisis of agriculture
                    throughout the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it one of these UN organizations that some people say
                        arover-staffed and have too many people who have been there too long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Over-staffed, too many people there too long, and located in a very bad
                    work climate. That of Rome is very, very bad. The bureaucracy of Rome is beyond
                    belief. The stupor and the arrogance of the Italian bureaucracy astonish me. I
                    had no idea of such a thing. All I can say is that it is quite a change to go
                    from Geneva to Rome. Everyone should do it the other way around so as to end up
                    with the efficiency of Geneva!</p>
                <p>Q: This is a UN organization which after all does not deal so much with the
                    problems of the developed world, that is to say North America or Western Europe,
                    but it deals with the problems of the developing world. Would it be better
                    therefore, for example, to have the FAO in a country like the Philippines or
                    some place like Nairobi or even a country that really has food problems, like
                    India?</p>
                <p>MARSH: You mean to situate the FAO there where the need is great?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, you know, the FAO was located in Washington until 1957 and then as a
                    sop to the Italians, to give them prestige in their new post-war identity, it
                    was moved to Rome. Rome is not an important intellectual center, particularly in
                    the field of agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someplace that you think about when you think about
                        food.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right and so it is very difficult for people to keep up their
                    expertise in a place like that. Plus the fact that most people coming to the FAO
                    don't even speak Italian. What I'm trying to say is that if the FAO were still
                    here in Washington it would be a piece of cake for people at the FAO to keep up
                    with the state of the art. The great state universities, and Cornell University,
                    are so close to deal with exigencies of all kinds.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>Q: You have large non-profit organizations for example, like the FORD Foundation,
                    which are very active in certain parts of the world in trying to improve
                    agriculture and better strains of wheat and things like that in the Philippines.
                    I think it would be easier to follow that kind of stuff. Are you familiar with,
                    for example, a French agronomist named Rene Dumont?</p>
                <p>MARSH: Yes. Q: Where would Rene Dumont think that the FAO should be?</p>
                <p>MARSH: You may have one guess, and that would be fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That would be fine because at least you would have access to everything in
                    the French language, whereas having access to that in the universities in Italy
                    in Italian...thank you very much! Not much help!</p>
                <p>The practices of the FAO... for example the Legal Advisor at the FAO went from
                    Rome to Geneva of the same plane I did. I was going from Rome up to Geneva for a
                    high level meeting on the Geneva Group. I stayed in a third class hotel, having
                    flown coach; he stayed at the Inter-Continental having flown first class. Now
                    first class for a one hour flight in Europe just doesn't make any sense at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nonsense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: It's ridiculous. So the principal contributor of approximately one fourth
                    of the budget of the FAO is in steerage shall we say, and staying at the
                    flophouse shall we say, and an FAO functionary is in glory!</p>
                <p>Q: So when Madeline Albright, our Secretary of State, is trying very hard to
                    persuade the American Congress to pay up our arrears to the UN, you think it
                    would be helpful if the UN for its part showed more effort to economize?</p>
                <p>MARSH: No...not necessarily. Well, I think it should economize for other reasons,
                    let's put it that way. But point of fact is that I take a very orthodox position
                    with respect to payment of dues. These are Treaty obligations of the United
                    States... pay up and shut-up about the past! But talk a lot and act a lot for
                    the future. Pay it. Besides which, I don't want members of the Congress
                    complaining about the 'perquisites' of foreign officials because I may laugh
                    myself to death!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We still all fly in and out of National rather than
                        Dulles!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>MARSH: That's right. That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, Bill, one final question. You have had an unusually, in my opinion, an
                    unusually long and, if I may also say so, a distinguished career in the Foreign
                    Service. I think it is 36 years. Most of the rest of us have served considerably
                    shorter time, at least these days. I wonder if you could take five minutes and
                    give us some of your thoughts of what the Foreign Service should be doing and
                    what the United States Government should be doing now, that we are not. In other
                    words an overview of the lessons learned in your career.</p>
                <p>MARSH: When I first came into the Service there was a gentlemanly code in effect,
                    noblesse oblige, if you will, and one wasn't supposed to complain about salary
                    or about 'perquisites' or something of that sort. So we did without or we paid
                    ourselves for things in the public interest. Times have changed and today's
                    young people demand gratification and reimbursement. They also want to budget
                    their time themselves, rather than having some old DCM or Department official
                    tell them to do this or that. I found for example that the notion of a
                    forty-hour week was very well installed in my people in Geneva. If I asked them
                    to take, perhaps, two hours on a Sunday to go and meet a Delegation, see them to
                    their hotels and then work with them throughout the rest of the week, some
                    people were very, very begrudging, openly begrudging, of even two hours on
                    Sunday. I think we need to take these realities into account. Times have
                    changed.</p>
                <p>I think we have to understand that there are great costs to the three-year
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The three-year career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right, which is now becoming people who want to come in for a
                    single tour. I think there are too many people in the Department who say this is
                    great because then we can use lower paid junior officers all the time and not
                    have to have these high-paid old fogeys like Marsh, who has been around for 36
                    years. There is a cost. There is a terrific cost in that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>I think that we also in the Department are suffering from a terrible complacency,
                    ever since 1991, and that complacency is the wolf is dead, hurray, what with the
                    evaporation, the collapse of the Soviet Union. There are plenty of crises that
                    have taken place and will be taking place, actually we have been very lucky,
                    much too lucky. How well wired in are we with the decision-makers?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The decision-makers overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>MARSH: Overseas, yes. For example, it has taken two efforts by the IMF apparently
                    to bring President Suharto of Indonesia around to accepting the austerity that
                    his situation has imposed on the country.</p>
                <p>Q: This goes back to something that you were talking about earlier, that
                    political reporting from overseas posts is pretty good. But oftentimes economic
                    reporting, particularly macro economics in terms of let's say South Korea's
                    overall economy or Thailand's overall economy or Indonesia's overall economy and
                    the concerns about possible collapse...we don't do a good enough job on
                    that?</p>
                <p>MARSH: I think we worry ourselves to death with respect to that. What we need to
                    think about is much more pragmatic, namely to what use can a given set of
                    reporting be? Tailor our reporting so that content and subject matter and timing
                    and so forth correspond to policy-makers' needs, that kind of thing. We have got
                    perhaps too much of an academic focus. Saying what a given political or
                    religious minority is thinking about at a particular time in a particular
                    country is going to be of interest, even though we are talking about Western
                    Europe, for example, rather than some fomenting Eastern society.</p>
                <p>Also we need a sense of proportion about things. I remember one time when there
                    was a cable from New Delhi on Indian reaction to a given policy move. This is
                    some time ago, a decade or so ago. It was 24 pages long! Now did they really
                    expect Washington to read 24 pages on that sort of thing? Besides which times
                    have changed and we have got to change with them.</p>
                <p>For example, with respect to a hijacking in Geneva soon after I arrived there,
                    CNN had found a way to get its people on the airfield. My Security officer was
                    unable to get on it. Washington was having simultaneous filming and stories from
                    the airport, real time work. The mission couldn't possibly compete with
                    that.</p>
                <p>The wire services, television services all of that kind of thing plus the fact
                    that you've got now electronic mail moving at incredible rates. That means that
                    you are going to get narrative reporting, not very analytical but that is going
                    to be taken care of. What we are going to have to deal with then is to get the
                    interpretation of the news analysis in as quickly as possible. Our processes
                    where you go through supervisory layer after layer even at a small embassy
                    overseas just make that ridiculous.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>I admit to being something of a Luddite here, but we have become idol worshipers,
                    we worship the computer now. All I want to say is that I have my reservations
                    about it. You know, with his quill pen Thomas Jefferson didn't do a bad job, so
                    stop knocking those of us who still rely on handwriting. I incidentally found
                    out my nickname from Rome. It was 'Mr. Fountain Pen' because my staff thought it
                    was so archaic and unusual that I had an ink fountain pen, as a matter of
                    fact.But in any event, is it cost effective? Is it truly cost effective to spend
                    all this money on computers, to be training people in computers, to be having
                    officers do all their own secretarial work? Maybe you should set up steno pools
                    and maybe you should set up secretarial pools...note the difference between
                    those two...and all that kind of thing rather than having substantive officers
                    do it.</p>
                <p>Another thing, too, is that once you put a computer in front of an individual,
                    remember, he has got direct access to the world...or she does. No DCM is going
                    to be able to guarantee that a disgruntlement is not going to reach a Senate
                    office, or that an ultimatum is not going to go to a local critic of the United
                    States. This is a different world because you are putting a huge communications
                    tool in the hands of everybody. And, also, let us fact it...they haven't found
                    out a way yet to make these free from penetration by adversaries.</p>
                <p>Some nerd in Columbus, Ohio is even now reading what you are writinon your
                    machine.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. In terms of running an embassy and presenting a sort of united policy
                    front. With the proliferation of American government agencies abroad now the
                    ambassador and the DCM are having a much more difficult time sort of keeping
                    track of what is sent back to Washington from their post with or without their
                    permission.</p>
                <p>MARSH: That is true, but, Nick, there is something else as well. It is that for a
                    lot of people the difficulty of the job is in leaving the mission or the embassy
                    and going out and seeing the local contact and having a discussion in Heaven
                    knows what language, then making notes on it and then coming back and writing it
                    all up and reporting to one's superiors about it. How much simpler it is just to
                    stay in front of that machine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forever!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And have a lovely dialogue with the desk back in Washington. That kind of
                    thing. So we need to put the spur to our people to get them out as never
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, is the Foreign Service still an interesting and
                        worthwhilcareer for young people to consider?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: For some.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, it is an interesting career for people...I want to say this, Nick,
                    it used to be said in a semi-jocular sort of way that private income was very
                    helpful as a supplement to the Foreign Service salary. I don't think it is a
                    joke anymore, I think it's a necessity and I'll tell you why. The entry levels
                    today of salaries are less in real terms than they were in 1960. At least in my
                    case, this is true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are not competitive with private companies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Oh, I'm not even talking about that aspect of it. I'm saying they have not
                    even kept pace with inflation here. I got $6,200 and they are starting today at
                    31, 33 thousand, something of that sort. Work it out for yourself.</p>
                <p>The Department loves to say that it wants to have a Foreign Service that looks
                    like America. On the other hand it doesn't want to pay them like America and it
                    doesn't want to take into account that today's young people are very, very
                    dollar-minded and perk-minded and comfort-minded and everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just like everybody else in America!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Just like everybody else in America, that's correct! Let me put it in
                    another way. There are people coming into the Foreign Service at ages that were
                    beyond the pale when you and I came in. There are people coming in who have big
                    school loans to pay off. There are people who are paying alimony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking after their parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Looking after their parents. All sorts of things and all these cost money
                    and need money and they are going to have to develop a rationale and an argument
                    that says we have to have money. That is going to require the President to lend
                    his weight to the effort because the exceptional circumstances under which the
                    Foreign Service necessarily operates mean that exceptional steps have to be
                    taken and it has to be an exceptional group of people to deal with these things,
                    whether you like it or not. Otherwise only the rich can possibly come in and do
                    a job in the Foreign Service and we are back to where we were in 1900.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is not representative of the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, thank you very kindly. It has been a great pleasure
                        for mto listen to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, you are very kind. I've only known you coming on 43 years, believe
                    it or not. It is sort of extraordinary. How can this be when both of us are
                    obviously only 30! But at any rate I say that for some people today, and I'm
                    thinking particularly of the young people and again I'm thinking essentially in
                    terms of entry level people because I still believe you should work your way up
                    in the Foreign Service. But you know, psychologically why don't we go over to 18
                    or 24 grades? So then every other year a man would be able to go home and tell
                    his wife, or a wife be able to go home and tell her husband, “Dear, guess what,
                    I've been promoted from FS-19 to FS-18.” Because going and talking about a
                    promotion every eight years just won't hack it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Do you know that I made it from FSO-8 to FSO-4 faster than I did any other
                    promotion? From one level to a single level. I mean those were the days, right?
                    I think the up or out system is very influential. I think it is unfortunate
                    because it is particularly working a hardship on the able people. I know
                    instances where it was the dullard who had the longest career! As one who had a
                    long career, I can prove that, right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hardly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: But in any event I think we have to revisit that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's say the threshold from two to one or three to
                        two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: Well, the whole notion. It is really a trickery to say that one has so
                    many years to be promoted to Career Minister when you are promoting one or two
                    persons a year to Career Minister. That is just trickery. It sounds like a
                    competition and you have better odds, I think, with Publisher's Clearinghouse
                    Sweepstakes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Bill Marsh, that's it. Thank you very kindly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MARSH: And thank you, Nick.</p>
