                <p>JANE BYINGTON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Margaret Sullivan</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 8, 1989</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [You were] going to tell me something about the Lindbergh
                        case and how that relates to modern terrorism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I wouldn't have thought of it if you hadn't mentioned trying to
                    teach a twelve-year old about kidnapping. This takes me back two generations. I
                    was carefully told, living here in Washington, never to get into a car while
                    walking to school if anybody offered me a ride. Under any circumstances, I was
                    to say “no.” That was simple. I don't remember that I was particularly told why
                    not to do it. I was abroad at the time of the Lindbergh kidnapping and came back
                    with a small child and a nurse. My parents greeted us at the dock. My father
                    took one look with horror at the nurse and said, “For God's sake get her out of
                    that uniform; you're an absolute target for kidnapping.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was what it was like to come back as a young
                        Foreign Service wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: With a child, with a nurse so that I could enjoy coming to parties here
                    at the Sulgrave and so on, and being told that the nurse must be gotten out of
                    uniform, because it was a target for kidnapping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So some of it hasn't changed...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that ... another thing that's fascinating is that
                        some of these kinds of things, while they become more apparent at certain
                        periods, haven't changed all that much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Kidnapping, in the U.S., I think perhaps is connected with the
                    lawlessness that grew up out of the bootlegging generation. Certainly nowhere
                    else that we lived did we personally, as Americans, feel in danger of kidnapping
                    — of other things, yes, but not kidnapping.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you feel in danger of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Bomb throwing in Havana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: 1932. Bombs were thrown while we were in the movies. Bombs were thrown
                    at the apartment house we lived in — not at us, but just part of the general
                    counter-Machado, at that time, activities. And Machado in the due course was
                    over-thrown by... Baptista?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd have to check that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes, and Baptista was over-thrown by...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Castro.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Castro. For a brief period somewhere in there, there was a president
                    that was not a dictator, but he only lasted a year. I couldn't tell you his
                    name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in Washington and grew up...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, I was born in New York. I think you could skip all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start with how you joined the Foreign Service
                        — in the loose sense of the word. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, on and off for a period of years my parents wintered here
                    and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here meaning Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Here meaning Washington, and everybody of my generation says, “Oh how
                    Washington has changed.” Certainly it has changed far more than any of the older
                    capitals of the world. In my time it was inevitable that you met young Foreign
                    Service officers, even those training. They went to a school called Crawford —
                    you really ought to get other people's remembrances of Crawford — who prepped
                    them for the exams. And so in the due course of events, I met my husband, having
                    met Harry Lewis long before. And in the due course of events we got married.
                    There was nothing particularly odd about that. It was the same pattern with
                    Elfie and Burke [Elbrick]. Some of my acquaintances married foreign diplomats,
                    but that was the core of Washington's social life fifty, sixty years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, studying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I went to law school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you expecting to practice law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you finish law school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I got married instead of joining the firm that I [a] had job
                    at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was also sort of the normal course of events at
                        that point — that if one were married, one didn't consider being a
                        lawyer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, possibly there were some fields that one could have continued in,
                    in a foreign post, but it's practically impossible to practice law abroad. If
                    you've studied in the District of Columbia you also get some law as it's used in
                    Virginia, but you can't just pack your suitcase and go practice in New York. I
                    think the same is true probably in medicine. You have to take the examination in
                    the state where you plan to practice. In fact I know it's true. I have a
                    brother-in-law who practices in New York City and lives in Connecticut and he
                    can't practice in Connecticut even if it's an emergency night call. He can go
                    out and put a bandage on an accident, but he can't treat patients.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the question I would ask is did you think twice?
                        Was, is it a question in your mind whether you wanted to be a Foreign
                        Service... be married to your husband and therefore follow in the Foreign
                        Service, or be a lawyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, in my particular case there was no question. One, I wanted to be
                    married, and two, I was delighted with the idea of being away. I didn't have the
                    slightest feeling that my life was about to become limited nor was it in any
                    way, shape or form limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I wanted you to say [laughs]. He joined the
                        Foreign Service in 1930, and he was already in the Foreign Service when you
                        met him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And posted in Havana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were married...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: In '32 and went to Havana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the kind of life when you went there as a bride?
                        You were twenty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Did you record that bit about dictators or not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bomb throwing, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. Provided you minded your “p”s and “q”s, you were perfectly safe
                    there. We never wandered off into the countryside alone. The day before I
                    arrived, there had been the funeral of some important politician at which all of
                    the diplomatic corps attended and by a miracle the bomb planted in the graveyard
                    went off after the funeral instead of during it, so the diplomatic corps was not
                    wiped out. Well, to begin with, when one's young I don't think you worry so much
                    about what's going to happen. You're sure it isn't going to happen to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the routine of being a very young, very
                        junior Foreign Service wife in a post like Havana? You arrived. You were a
                        bride.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, at this point you've got to have just a little idea of the
                    organization of the Service at that time. Most men's first assignments were
                    limited to about a year or a year and a half, so you knew you were not going to
                    stay at that post very long; and therefore, you didn't have the same — I say
                    you; I didn't have the same — feeling of particularly trying to put down any
                    roots in Havana. I think that's probably true of most of us. We knew we were
                    going to be there such a short time, that it was more a question of “let's enjoy
                    it while we're here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did make the routine calls and observe this sort of
                        thing, or is that overdrawn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It's overdrawn in the sense of its importance and how much time it
                    consumed. If two of you get in a car and run around it's fairly easy to leave
                    all those little pieces of pasteboard in a half, three-quarters of an hour. And
                    obviously a junior officer's wife only called on your own Service; you didn't go
                    call on the other diplomats. I assume that I left cards at the Embassy. The
                    ambassador then was one of the Guggenheim family, as far as I know, never in
                    residence the entire time I was there. The charg� was a man named Reed whose
                    wife was one of a Washingtonian real estate firm with whom I lunched at one
                    time. Naturally I called on the Consul General's wife, and she is a story unto
                    herself. They were charming to us, notoriously difficult. In fact when my
                    father-in-law, who was then Chief of Personnel, assigned his son to Havana,
                    people asked him, “Good Lord why do you send him to the vice consul killer?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “notoriously difficult”, without [laughter]
                        saying what you wouldn't want to see in print, how would you describe that
                        so that someone else could understand it? I think I know what you mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I called, and I was duly invited to tea, and then I was told by
                    Mrs. Dumont that she expected me to stop by every afternoon and my husband on
                    the way home from work could pick me up. She also expected us to come every
                    Saturday night for dinner and play bridge. So I went home, torn between storms
                    of anger and storms of weeping and said I was taking the next ship back to the
                    U.S.That was not for me. And my husband said, “Now stop and think if you're
                    bright enough to rearrange this to suit yourself.”</p>
                <p>So I thought it over and duly went back to tea, and made a beautiful sob story
                    about how my husband and I were just married and we were living on a shoestring,
                    all of which was true, and he was so devoted to his work that we never went out
                    on weeknights and Saturday night was our only night to indulge ourselves. And it
                    was obviously a well-done story because she said, “Oh my darling, of course, and
                    I never thought about that. What would be a nice night for you?” And I said,
                    “Well Thursday night is the night we don't have a cook.” [laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>She said, “Of course, I never thought of that. Why I have this whole staff of
                    Chinese. You will come on Thursday nights.” So duly on Thursday nights we went
                    and played bridge and had a very good dinner and it was no effort at all. But
                    you had to know how to handle Mrs. Dumont. There probably are not too many left
                    around who remember the Dumonts. And they should be recorded.</p>
                <p>He had been an important executive in the Pennsylvania Railroad before World War
                    I and was during the war in charge of military transportation in France. Whether
                    he actually took over the running of the French railroads from the French
                    government, those details I don't know. But when the war was over, he was then,
                    I suppose, a man in his fifties, and why he yearned to join the Foreign Service,
                    I don't know. But he obviously came in at a top rank. They had no children and
                    he was an extremely able man, also very fair but very — I suppose I might say —
                    intolerant of stupidity.</p>
                <p>One other illustration of the type of man he was: He belonged to the New York
                    Yacht Club, which is probably one of the more distinguished in the U.S., or was
                    at that time, and therefore he was automatically invited to join the Havana
                    Yacht Club. However, the Havana Yacht Club did not accept members from the
                    Consular Service, only the diplomats, whereupon Mr. Dumont said, “I would not be
                    seen in any club where the officers who work with me are unacceptable,” and
                    withdrew his membership from the Havana Yacht Club. Now that is an act of
                    generosity and courage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is. I'm curious... I thought that the Diplomatic
                        Service and the Consular Service had been joined in our Service some time
                        before that with the Foreign Service Act of '24.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, what you referred to is the Rogers Act of 1924. Again, I suggest
                    Stewart's book on the State Department. And as another sideline on that
                    amalgamation, Ambassador Grew, Under Secretary Grew's memoirs are quite explicit
                    [Joseph C. Grew, Ambassador to Japan and Under Secretary of State]. However,
                    whatever the United States prefers to make as laws in its own country have
                    nothing to do with other countries. When we went to Italy after Havana, members
                    of the Embassy in Rome were allowed to import liquor and cigarettes. There was
                    no such thing as the commissary. [laughs] I don't want to get started on that.
                    The consuls of the United States accredited in Italy were not allowed to import.
                    Now that had nothing to do with the American government's conception of who a
                    consul was. This had to do with Italian laws. Diplomats could, and consuls
                    couldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: And that was that. I honestly don't think we suffered very greatly. I
                    have smoked something called Trestelle, and we did a certain amount of smuggling
                    off the ships that called, but suffer we did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go further into your own lives, what I would
                        like to do is ask you what it was like to marry into a family which had a
                        Foreign Service history and where your father-in-law was the Chief of
                        Personnel. This must have been an interesting sort of extra twist to the
                        business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Of course, at the time, I didn't realize that it was different from any
                    one of the other wives that I knew. Certainly, my father-in-law's one,
                    reminiscences of his time, and two, the friends or colleagues with whom he was
                    working here in Washington were in and out of the house discussing a great many
                    things that — when I say I overheard, it wasn't a question of any secrecy. It
                    was just day-to-day things they were discussing, which I now realize I was
                    certainly inside to how the things worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's stop then and maybe you could tell me some
                        about how it did work in the years that your father-in-law was running it —
                        as you understood it from what you heard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: In order to do this, I really wish I had more exact knowledge, but
                    going back to the Rogers Act of 1924, that amalgamated the two American
                    services... Just how the diplomats were appointed... I'm not certain what sort
                    of examinations they had or whether they were entirely personally appointed
                    because of knowing someone. I honestly don't know. The Consular Service had an
                    examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is before '24?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: This is before '24. The first career consuls were appointed in about
                    1900, 1902, and there were five or six of them, of whom my father-in-law was
                    one, and they were promised a thousand dollars a year for life. That was fairly
                    good money in 1900. However, they had no expenses, no living allowance, no
                    travel allowance, but that wasn't important. After the Rogers Act — and there
                    were several shifts in how many people were to be on the personnel board, and
                    whether it was to be the Assistant Secretary — but immediately after that act,
                    the diplomatic group felt that all of the promotions, or most of the promotions,
                    in the amalgamated service had been given to consular officers, and there was
                    considerable acrimony about the whole thing. And in 1928, my father-in-law was
                    appointed Chief of Personnel. The Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Administration (I'm not sure it was called “administration” then) was a man
                    named Wilbur J. Carr. And the new promotion board was set up.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>From what I've heard over the years, it was felt that my father-in-law
                    administered the whole service in a very fair way, although he himself had never
                    had a diplomatic post per se. I think more weight was put on the inspectors'
                    reports rather than the principal officers' reports. I do know that the
                    principal officers' reports were completely confidential and were not seen by
                    anybody except the promotion boards and the inspectors. And it was the
                    inspectors' comments on the principal officers' comments that perhaps carried
                    the most weight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “I think this one was a good report...that this was a fair
                        assessment, and this was not a good assessment.” That sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Or, frequently, an inspector would say, “Well, because of this or that
                    problem at the post, X really has not fairly evaluated Y.” O(they used to call
                    my father-in-law “Chief”), “Remember that John Doe in Salonica is a prot�g� of
                    so and so, and therefore he's not going to like Billy Willy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a small enough Foreign Service at that time that
                        everybody knew almost everybody or knew of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes, they didn't know each other, but the administration of personnel
                    was something that was personal. It wasn't a computer. Very personal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they look at wives in that? Because, later, wives
                        came to be evaluated. Certainly, when I started out, wives were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Wives were evaluated then very definitely. Again, my own personal
                    feeling is that inspectors' reports were extremely important. Every inspection
                    that we had, I had a personal interview with the inspector. I was encouraged to
                    discuss anything I wished to bring up, and I was told where I was being
                    troublesome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that there was a pattern that they expected wives to
                        follow? Maybe that's not the right way to put it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No. Again, my personal feeling, judging from the younger wives that I
                    knew in the last ten years of our service, we were a much more individualistic
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As young women?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: As young women, than the young women of today. We didn't do the same
                    things. We weren't particularly chummy with each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then when they said a wife was being troublesome, what did
                        they mean by being troublesome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I knew what they meant in my case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you mind sharing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: We happened to have on our staff an officer, not particularly younger
                    than we, and a wife, and they were both persons I didn't care for for two
                    reasons. They both drank, and they rowed with each other and I simply refused,
                    blankly, to have them in my house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can appreciate that [laughs].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And the inspector felt that this was disruptive to the, as it was, to
                    the general social functioning of the post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your husband was the consul at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, no, he was... I don't want to say where it was, because I don't
                    want to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. He wasn't the senior person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: He wasn't the senior person. But he was senior to these people I didn't
                    care for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they worked for him, or he...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes, they were on the staff of the office. I might equally well say
                    that that particular inspector who admonished me did not like my father-in-law
                    at all so I weighed his admonitions against my knowledge that he and my
                    father-in-law did not get on. As it's past, I can say that. Those are the things
                    that one could know in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Easier than now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: I think almost impossible to know now. There's no way of knowing who
                    anybody is. We had then a book that was published by the Department which was a
                    biography of everybody and their wives. It probably... It was not published, I
                    think, after the war, but at that time you could look anybody up. You could find
                    out where they were born, whom they'd married, what their posts had been, what
                    their grades were. So you knew about a new arrival before they arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there training for wives at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, not that I ever participated in other than languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Miss Bassell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Who?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Miss Bis...B...oh, Bassell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Miss Bassell. Well, again I happened to have known her before I was
                    married, so she didn't particularly... She was the sister-in-law of a Senator
                    Carter Glass. She was an old Virginian. She lived at the National Democratic
                    Club which was around the corner here on New Hampshire, I don't know if it's
                    still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is. It's still one of the best, big brick buildings in
                        town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: She used to advise young officers. Well, backtrack just a minute, in
                    those... In the days that I began in the Service, after a man had been
                    appointed, he usually was sent to the field immediately and again, usually,
                    nearby posts — Canada, Cuba — for about a year, a year and a half. I mentioned
                    that as regards Havana. And he usually was not married, because if he were
                    married, the Department did not pay for his wife to go to the post.</p>
                <p>Then he was brought back and went to what was called “the School” here in
                    Washington, for about three months, and Miss Bassell could not have been the
                    director of the school, but certainly was an advisor to the school in one way or
                    other, and she told the young men what they should or should not do socially.
                    But I don't think she ever officially indoctrinated wives in the sense of there
                    being classes or anything of that sort. She often invited young couples to come
                    over and play bridge, or have dinner with her, or she'd invite a group of wives
                    to have lunch with her. But I don't think that it was ever, as I say, part of a
                    course for women.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>We did have in those days a wives' club. Again, I think it was purely unofficial
                    or voluntary, and it met about once a month for lunch. Most people knew
                    everybody else at it. If you didn't, you soon met them. If you were on home
                    leave here and stopped in Washington and it was meeting, you usually went,
                    because you saw old friends. But, again, I feel that it was not organized the
                    way the Foreign Service Association is today.</p>
                <p>It was fun. We used to have various arguments about where to have it, because we
                    tried to keep it down to a reasonable cost, and the problem, if we had it out in
                    Olney — which was the favorite place then — that often raised transportation
                    difficulties for people who were simply passing through. Olney cost less.
                    Occasionally we could persuade one of the large hotels to give us a cut-rate. I
                    don't remember that we did any “welfare work.” It was purely social.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have officers and that much structure to it, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes, because we had a treasurer, and we had a secretary who always
                    wanted some kind of help to get out the notices and keep the membership
                    list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] Things don't change very much, do they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't remember voting for officers. I think they were perhaps more
                    informally named. I honestly don't remember. It didn't seem to be awfully
                    important. It was never a group in which there were deep divisions or
                    factions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was purely social?It didn't deal with... It didn't
                        either do welfare work in the community or “political work?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, not at all. I think it probably did do, in a purely voluntary way,
                    assistance to newcomers. There was a desk in the — then we were in Old State.
                    There was a desk that had lists of where to rent, or Foreign Service,
                    particularly Foreign Service, people who wanted to rent their houses either for
                    a long period or a short period. They gave assistance about, or advice rather,
                    about schools, about general things of that sort.</p>
                <p>And also, they were helpful about mail. Now I'm not quite certain how that
                    worked. But if you knew that you were coming back to the U.S., you could have
                    your mail sent to this desk and they would hold it for you. Or, if you wanted
                    mail sent abroad via the pouch — I don't know whether that's permitted today or
                    not — you did it through this desk.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It still...? And some of the wives helped that. But again, I don't
                    remember that anyone was pressured into doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just that that person was so inclined and did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Did, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mother-in-law a factor in any of this? You've
                        talked about your father-in-law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: You mean to me personally or to the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start with what she did with the Foreign Service,
                        and then let's talk about her in relation to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't think that she was particularly active in the Foreign Service
                    per se. My mother-in-law was a very intelligent, charming person, but she was
                    not gregarious. She was certainly not intimate with masses of people. I don't
                    think that she had any effect whatsoever on the Foreign Service or wives in
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She'd go to the lunches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Oh yes. She went to the lunches indeed. She lived in her own world so
                    that she could be charming, pleasant, and as far as she was concerned what had
                    happened had no effect on her. She herself was a Foreign Service wife for
                    forty-odd years and had good friends, but not in a gregarious way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of advice did she have for you when you started?
                        Or did she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Absolutely none. She never... I don't remember that she ever gave me
                    any advice at all about anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The perfect mother-in-law.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Absolutely. My own parents both died when I was relatively young. I was
                    perhaps — I'm just trying to think — twenty-three. Yes, I was twenty-nine when
                    my mother died. In any case, all of our home leaves, all of our holidays were
                    always spent with my in-laws even after they retired. And my father-in-law
                    always kept up his interest in the Service.All sorts of people came to see him
                    in retirement.</p>
                <p>And I saw the article in the State Department magazine just before I left Spain,
                    which was about William Dean Howells [19th century author] as a consul. My
                    great-grandfather-in-law had been a newspaper man and had scooped the Battle of
                    Gettysburg. Some years ago, it would have been the hundredth anniversary of the
                    Battle of Gettysburg, the New York Tribune [not then the Herald Tribune] just
                    the Tribune, ran an article that was afterwards a television program, called
                    “Who is Byington?” because my great grandfather-in-law's message about the
                    battle was the first news that taken to President Lincoln, and President Lincoln
                    turned and said, “Well, who is Byington?” And the then Secretary of War — I do
                    not know his name, but it's easy enough to find out — was from Connecticut and
                    therefore did know who my great-grandfather-in-law was.</p>
                <p>Well, we go on a number of years and this man — he was A. Homer Byington — he was
                    offered the consulship of Naples and he was then a man over his seventies. And
                    his sons simply were up in the air about this and more or less said, “Well, Dad,
                    you've never been abroad. You don't speak Italian. What are you doing with this
                    wild idea?” But go he would, and he was persuaded to take with him his
                    eighteen-year-old grandson, who was my father-in-law.</p>
                <p>In those days, as it said in the William Dean Howells article, the consul
                    collected the fees and paid the expenses. So he hired his son — his grandson —
                    as his clerk. And off they went to Naples. And my father-in-law was then
                    eighteen. It was about three or four years after that that... It was during
                    President Theodore Roosevelt's time that the first act creating a career
                    Consular Service was enacted by Congress. And my father-in-law took the... such
                    exams as they gave, and was one of the first five or six appointed. So from 1897
                    until my husband retired, there was always a Byington in the Service.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Yes, and my brother-in-law.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Father-in-law, husband, son, and brother-in-law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Five at one time or another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Five at one time or another. Our son served during the period my
                    husband was serving, but not afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's he doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: He's an international banker. And wants to retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] There's more money in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: That is a sideline on Foreign Service life. My husband was born in
                    Naples, after his father had become a career consul. He was born in 1908. So
                    that was all right. He was an American citizen. And when our son was born, he
                    was immediately registered at the Consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also born in Naples.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Born in Naples, and registered at the Consulate, and as far as the U.S.
                    government was concerned there was no question but what he was an American
                    citizen. But some years later we were passing through Naples — going I can't
                    remember where — and we went out to see our old house, and the gatekeeper rushed
                    out waving a piece of paper in front of us, so glad to see us, and this piece of
                    paper was calling our son up to do his Italian military service as an Italian
                    citizen. It so happened at the time he was serving in the U.S. Army in Germany.
                    My husband immediately got in touch with friends in the foreign office in Rome
                    and the matter was straightened out, but they said to my husband, “Don't ever
                    let this happen again, because your son is the son of a native-born Italian, and
                    therefore your son is a native-born Italian — born in Italy of a father born in
                    Italy and he's got to be an Italian.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember hearing at the time your son was then assigned
                        to Naples.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, he was subsequently assigned to Genoa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: In Italy, and told he must never have a son born in Italy. When his son
                    was born, they were in the U.S. so...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] That solved the problem. Is there anything more
                        you want to say about the family before we go on back to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As it comes up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: As it comes up, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you'd been in Havana for, what, less than a year
                        from the look of it. Six months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I was only there about six months. My husband was there about a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came home and he went to school for three months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: He went to school for three months. The school was known as the
                    “married school” and we even had a baby born at the school. It just happened to
                    be that they picked up all the men who had been married, and therefore hadn't
                    been called into the school earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was your baby that was born at the school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Someone else's. I've forgotten now who, but during that time. We gave
                    it a cup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went to Italy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And then we went to Naples.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there for six years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes, we went in '33 and left in '39. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, that's an awfully big question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start with what was it like to manage a house there,
                        since the first thing you did was to set up a household, I presume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I found it no problem at all, but I have to say honestly, I'm a fairly
                    good manager. Seems to me that was the least of my concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it then that you were concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I can't remember that I worried seriously about anything, but for
                    a while we didn't have a phone, but once we got a phone... For instance, we all
                    knew never, never, never to speak of anything confidential on the phone. All the
                    phones were tapped. It was taken for granted that they would be.</p>
                <p>Well, it was certainly a very interesting pre-war period. There was the abortive
                    German attempt to take over Austria. Italy rushed troops up to the border and
                    the take-over was not carried out. At that time Italy was still neutral. Then
                    there was the Ethiopian war and as I remember at the time, there's no doubt that
                    the mass of the Italians felt that they were justified in Ethiopia. There were
                    sanctions which had no affect whatsoever. If I remember rightly, Eden was the
                    English Foreign Minister. He pushed Italy into its eventual pro-German
                    position.</p>
                <p>Then there was the Spanish Civil War, which the Italian government supported.
                    That, contrary to the Ethiopian war, was not supported by the mass of the
                    Italian people in any way, to the extent that when the hospital ships returned
                    from Spain, they had to land at night in order that the people would not know
                    how many wounded there were. It also provided those of us who bothered to think
                    about it with an example of what was going to happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The Spanish consul, charming man, and his wife supported the Republican
                    government and therefore had to resign and were left stranded in Italy,
                    absolutely penniless. And I would say many, many of the consular corps — I'm not
                    talking now just about the Americans — rallied to raise funds for them.</p>
                <p>I don't know what happened to them in the end. Their position, which in later
                    years I learned was that of many other people, was that they had entered a
                    service and taken an oath to a government. They certainly were not communists
                    themselves, but they felt they had to support the properly elected government.
                    As I say, I don't have any idea what happened to them. Very shortly after that
                    we went to Belgrade. I do remember the Munich Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you when that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: We were still in Naples then. I can remember meeting with Italian
                    friends night after night in those three or four days and wondering what was
                    going to happen the next day, and our profound relief that we hadn't all gone to
                    war. But everybody knowing that all we'd done was postpone — I say “we,” the
                    world. All that had happened was the inevitable. It did postpone for a little
                    while. Nobody thought it wasn't going to happen. Naples was of course a
                    beautiful post — with interest. Anybody could find something to do: archeology,
                    geology.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you spend a lot of your time doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I certainly happen to literally adore history so I couldn't get
                    enough. There was so much there that you didn't even begin to have to think of
                    what was happening in some other part of the world. And of course I studied
                    Italian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you follow history on your own, or were you a part of
                        a group? I'm assuming you're meaning history in the early Roman history
                        sense, or are you also meaning paying very close attention to current
                        events, or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Both and all. Don't get me started on history, because you'll never
                    hear the end of it. You just have to take it for granted that I went to some
                    courses at the University of Naples. I did vast amounts of reading on my own. I
                    tended to probe for information from any historian that came wandering around.

                        up a good bit of your time or were you free to do — pursue your own

                <p>BYINGTON: Again, as I haven't been active in the Service in, what is it, fifteen
                    years, I'm not exactly sure, beyond reading the State Department Bulletin, how
                    posts are organized today. Certainly we were not organized. We didn't have
                    women's lunches. We didn't... Occasionally, we met for lunch.</p>

                    occurred to most of us that we wouldn't be. Some of us were able to do it more
                    easily. Others were not — how should I put it — socially...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Just as a mild illustration. I can remember somewhere along the way
                    that at large receptions, if I saw people standing in the corner looking a bit
                    stranded, I was to go up to them and say who I was; that I was Jane Byington,
                    and that I was on the staff; were they enjoying their visit to Naples or
                    whatever other place I might have been; was there something they would like to
                    see, and could I introduce them to someone, and to lead them gently over to some
                    other group and say, “This is Mr. Brown from Milwaukee. He's here attempting to
                    negotiate buying hemp” (or whatever it might be) and try to keep groups moving,
                    not let them be isolating. But it wasn't something that was so difficult that
                    you had to stay awake at night thinking about it. Naturally as we progressed up
                    to higher ranks, we were called in more often to be of assistance, but...</p>
                <p>There was a difference between serving under a career officer who, shall we say,
                    knew the ropes having gone though it themselves, and serving under outside
                    appointees, who in their private lives had had large staffs paid by either their
                    corporations or their political offices, and who tended to expect more personal
                    care and feeding of themselves. The career officer didn't think that you were
                    going to help them do their personal shopping except perhaps in an emergency.
                    The political appointee tended to think, not always, that the staff was at their
                    beck and call the same way it would be in their office in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in that they included wives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Probably included wives in a way they wouldn't have in the U.S. I don't
                    know about corporations in the U.S. except through daughters-in-law. They
                    included wives simply because wives were more visible in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did the consul's wife in Naples, or did the successive
                        consuls' wives in Naples sort of say, “You will come Thursday night to
                        dinner and play bridge,” in the same way it happened in Havana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No. That's because the Dumonts...Well, we were lucky in that almost all
                    of our chiefs were persons of rather unique characteristics and abilities. Our
                    first chief in Naples was Coert duBois, who had served under my father-in-law at
                    one point. They were charming, enchanting, individualistic, highly intelligent
                    people, and any moments one could possibly have with them were treasured
                    moments. Never a bore and never a chore. But that's because they themselves were
                    outstanding people. If Margaret duBois wanted me to come down and join in her
                    Italian classes, I was delighted. It would have made it far more interesting
                    then. He and my husband used to go off on weekend sails in his sailboat and had
                    a marvelous time. But again, as I said a little earlier, my general impression
                    is that we were, as a whole in the Service, more individualistic that we are
                    today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kuala Lumpur (KL) was our first post and so that would
                        have been at the end of the '50's. There was certainly a notion that there
                        was a great deal expected and a system that sort of imposed itself on wives
                        and what they would do, and where they would go, and, to a degree, how they
                        would dress. And those of us who tended to be somewhat individualistic were
                        quietly, and not so quietly, told not to be so individualistic. I remember
                        that happening. How would you say that developed if the pre-war Foreign
                        Service seemed to have in it a place for individualism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Let's take K. L. as a starting point, it's as good a point as any. When
                    I got there — I had only been there a few days — I was invited to come to a
                    morning coffee the wives' group had organized as part of my arriving, and —
                    well, naturally everybody was very nice to me — and we sat around and
                    chit-chatted. I remember masses of chocolate cake. I edicted — that is the
                    correct word — that there would be no more coffee parties.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I think I probably talked to each wife individually and explained my reason, that
                    I felt that coffee parties were a waste of time, and that I didn't think that
                    any organized project by all the wives was going to have much success. I
                    strongly urged every wife to take up something that interested her. Two or three
                    of the wives said, “Thank goodness, because I've been asked to do this or that
                    or the other thing.” And I said, “For heaven's sakes go do it. I would like to
                    have every wife do something along whatever lines they choose.” Were the Chases
                    there when you got there?</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Peg Davit went off and became the liaison between the — well they must
                    have called it the Red Crescent — but in any case, whatever the Malayan Red
                    Cross group was and the more or less Diplomatic Corps as a whole. Some one of
                    the wives read books for the blind.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: I can't remember what each one did, but each one went off and did
                    something, and after a couple of years of this I think this particular thing
                    started out. There was something called the Presidential Award. In any case, I
                    asked each wife to write up a little piece not more than a page of what they
                    were doing, and the whole thing was submitted. And our embassy won for that year
                    the President's Award for the greatest participation in local activities. And
                    when I went back ten years later it was still hanging on the office wall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: In all of the previous posts I'd been in, the other women, the
                    non-wives, were not included in wives' group activities. And I had suggested
                    after talking with Elaine — she's Elaine Young now — Elaine Evans what would be
                    useful... And at those luncheons all the women of the embassy met, and everyone
                    was encouraged to please bring a non-American friend. And Elaine felt that this
                    was helpful to the staff. It gave them an easy way to entertain, and most of
                    them did bring friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember those luncheons with great pleasure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't think we ever had a speaker or ever tried to organize
                    anything.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It was simply a chance to give all the women an opportunity to bring a
                    foreign friend if they wanted to, and an easy place to meet. But returning to
                    what you said about regimentation, I do agree with you and several of the wives
                    that I thought had a lot to offer. Their husbands resigned or retired at earlier
                    levels, because they didn't care for the regimentation. But what brought it on,
                    I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made it a perception of regimentation, because in
                        fact, as you say we did do what we wanted to do, at least in KL, and by the
                        time I went from there to very small post and there was no regimentation at
                        all, but it was a twenty-four hour [a] day job. You were always on
                        view.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: I can only hazard a couple of guesses. In the immediate post-war
                    period, when we went back to Italy, we had the military commissary so a great
                    many of the new wives became accustomed to the commissary. The commissary was
                    just like going to the Safeway. When the military pulled out and military
                    facilities were no longer available, somehow the embassies fell into — I think
                    the error — of opening commissaries and canteens. So that instead of going off
                    and exploring the possibilities of the market, one simply went to the embassy
                    basement or the nearest warehouse. So when you went, as I say marketing, you
                    didn't meet anybody but your fellow Americans. It wasn't forced regimentation.
                    It was simplified regimentation.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, American schools started and perhaps it does make it easier for
                    the children. I have no way of commenting on that because to do that, you've got
                    to have a twin in an American school and the other in a foreign school. But
                    again that meant that the mothers, instead of meeting foreign mothers, tended to
                    have school life just exactly like school life in the United States. And you had
                    Cub Scouts, and you had the Fourth of July, and you had baseball games. Pre-war
                    we didn't have any of that. I don't remember an organized Fourth of July
                    anywhere I served before the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Organized in the sense of a reception? Or organized in the
                        sense of a community picnic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Neither, nothing. I can remember one Fourth of July a whole group of us
                    going off as a group to play golf together. That's the only organized Fourth of
                    July I can think of in all the pre WW II years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that national days and things like that took on a
                        different kind of importance after the war when there were more countries
                        having them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well of course, as a lower ranking person before the war, I don't
                    remember being invited to anybody else's national day. Perhaps the French tended
                    to have Bastille Day, but I don't... It was only after the war that this rather
                    chauvinistic attitude burst forth amongst perhaps everybody. In Rome it became a
                    large reception at the Embassy. Hordes came through so that it had to be
                    organized into more than one receiving line. So the naval attach� received one
                    group, the ambassador another, and so on. They got no hard liquor because
                    there's nobody that's going to pay for it.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: This is after the war. Certainly in Belgrade I don't remember any
                    shenanigans about the Fourth of July. In Madrid the Chamber of Commerce
                    organized a picnic. We just were, as far as I personally was concerned, less
                    regimented. At least I didn't feel regimented.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Oh, there was practically no official social life at all. Well, we and
                    two other vice consuls took a box at the opera, but that wasn't official.
                    Naturally in those days when you went to the opera, you wore black tie.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Americans? All of us. And the box seated six. The other two were not

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: We only did that one year because then those two left and nobody else
                    wanted to do it. The duBoises were not musical. Oh, of course there were a
                    certain number of official things. Perhaps if a ship came in or a congressional
                    delegation. Vice President Barkley came through while he was still a senator and
                    at the time Wahwee and Doug [Barkley's daughter and son-in-law, Douglas
                    MacArthur, nephew of the General] were posted in Naples. And I think the Consul
                    General did something about him because he was a senator. It couldn't have been
                    very onerous or I would have remembered about it. All I can say is, if there was
                    something official we went to, we probably thought, “What fun. We're going to
                    meet important people or we're going to see important people.” [Alben Barkley,

                <p>BYINGTON: Not as vice consuls or even consuls, no. Other than the inspectors.
                    [Laughter] Inspectors, if you had any sense, you entertained. And you
                    entertained visiting colleagues if you wanted to. The first dinner party I gave
                    for eight, oh dear, I do remember. The Consul General from Palermo had come up,
                    and of course our own Consul General and the inspector and his wife — and you
                    just try to seat eight people, man and wife who each have a rank. Let me tell
                    you, it cannot be done with any multiple of four if they all have rank. That's
                    perfectly true.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: In despair I went round and round and round the table and gave up, and
                    then I called Margaret duBois and said, “What do I do?” and she said, “It
                    doesn't work.” So I moved myself out of the host's place and gave it to the
                    Consul General and then all was right. And I remember, in that connection, there
                    was a naval visit of some sort and in any case I was given the job of the
                    seating. And there were a certain number of guests with a definite rank — oh I
                    suppose the prefect, and I suppose the visiting Italian admiral as well and so
                    on. And there were about — I'm not sure if it was a dinner that some people had
                    to pay to come to. I don't remember how it was financed. In any case there were
                    about forty people that all had a definite rank. And again, as it was a multiple
                    of four, it wouldn't seat, but there were enough small fry at it, admirals'
                    aides, that I could poke them around in corners and they didn't take the rank.
                    But it was something I perhaps lay awake about one night and that was all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, as far as I personally was concerned, I don't think I ever gave
                    it a thought. The few things one did were more or less automatic. It simply was
                    not a problem in any way, shape or form.</p>

                        because that was the way things happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It did make certain things go more smoothly. The fact that a new wife
                    arrived and made her calls, particularly in a large post, you realized that
                    somebody was there. This of course was not true at a small post. In Belgrade we
                    were perhaps four or five wives so you were bound to know this woman who
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>But in a large post like post-war Rome, where there were perhaps eighty or ninety
                    wives, there's no way that you would have known of their existence if some
                    protocol arrangement hadn't existed. There we did it a little bit differently.
                    It was like greasing the wheels. If you don't grease the wheels the car's going
                    to squeak. I cannot remember anybody being obsessed by it or — well it's not
                    fair to say I can't remember whether anybody was worried or not because I really
                    don't know — but certainly nobody was obsessed.</p>
                <p>[Transcriber's Note: Apparently about 1/2 hour of talk was omitted on the

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I think the great difference between a non-role — that's a vacuum — and
                    what I said was “the role” of “the wife” — that as a separate, special thing,
                    like being a movie star — I don't think any of us thought of. But we certainly
                    didn't think of ourselves in a “non-role.” We were all individualistic people.
                    Some were nutties. Some were highly intelligent. Some were extremely stupid. But
                    we weren't “non.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't think that naming people by what they did makes any point. You
                    just have to take it for granted that we were very definitely a group of women
                    who were definitely certain of their own existence.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Definitely. Just as some were unhappy, but they weren't
                    non-existent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said — I'm just going to try and encapsulate rather
                        quickly what we may have lost with the non-functioning machine. You talked
                        briefly about the various aspects of what you clearly saw as a job which
                        involved running an efficient household. And to a degree, on occasion, being
                        a helpmate in a capacity for your husband. And a social function which was
                        sometimes there and sometimes not. But certainly you had to mind your
                        behavior somewhat because that is what one did in a place where one was
                        slightly visible. Now that's my summary and it may not be accurate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: You want me to repeat about the tennis and the carrozza?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please do because that's a very good story and it makes a
                        point, actually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well I think that I said that the usefulness of a wife came under
                    different headings, one as the wife of a U.S. official. Perhaps we were told — I
                    suppose we must have been told — we were more conspicuous than the average
                    person and therefore had to be more responsible for our public behavior. And as
                    an illustration I spoke of the fact that I played tennis, but I did not play
                    well enough to give my husband a good game. So I frequently played with two of
                    the other vice consuls who all belonged to the tennis club. But I never went to
                    the tennis club in a car with either of the young men. I either drove down
                    myself, or my husband was going down and we went down together, or I went down
                    with another woman.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I didn't mention that, but it's part of the story. The wife of the
                    Crown Prince played in the tennis club and she always came down with a
                    lady-in-waiting who sat on the bench while she was playing. Married women simply
                    did not go out with other men in public places. Now this was no problem in any
                    way shape or form. It was simply a courtesy I paid to the society in which I was
                    living.</p>
                <p>The other story was about my sister who was visiting me and who was a charming
                    person and always had all the young men of Naples after her. One day, one of the
                    young Neapolitans called my husband obviously in the greatest state of agitation
                    — and an agitated Neapolitan male is something — and said, “Do you know what
                    your sister's doing?” And my husband said, “No. It's 10 o'clock in the morning.
                    She couldn't be doing anything very drastic.” And this man said, “She's riding
                    in a carrozza.” (That's a horse and carriage). “On Via Carracciolo.” And my
                    husband sort of said, “So what?” And then he remembered. And he had brought my
                    sister down with him in the car with him on the way to work and dropped her off
                    at the American Express to get some money. And she, in her innocence, had taken
                    the carriage and horse back to the house. And that particular drive, a woman
                    alone in a horse and carriage is what the Neapolitan prostitute does.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>So my husband leapt into the car, overtook the carrozza, took my sister out and
                    drove her home. Nobody had told her, nobody had told me, and he had forgotten
                    all about it because it was not something that had ever come up. Those are the
                    little things that... If she'd been simply a mere tourist, then someone would
                    have said, “Well there goes a typical American tourist.” You did try to be
                    polite in following the social customs of the country you were in.</p>
                <p>I might skip a number of years and go to Malaya in this context. I was told,
                    fortunately, that it was offensive to Muslims to have women have their arms and
                    shoulders bare. So when I wore a European-type of evening dress, I always took
                    with me some sort of flimsy shawl as a gesture. It didn't really cover me, but
                    it did show that I understood that they preferred arms and shoulders to be
                    covered. It was easy to do. That would make your husband's role easier in a
                    social sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing that we should go back to because I'm
                        reasonably certain that we have lost this time and I'm annoyed at myself for
                        my inefficiency with the machine. Let's talk briefly about rank and then
                        let's go to the Rogers Act because the Rogers Act is really important. You
                        made the point that rank made a big difference and people were quite
                        concerned about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Comparatively so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Comparatively. All right, that's a good word.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I think we'll really have to start with the Rogers Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's start with the Rogers Act and then talk
                        about rank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: The Rogers Act was definitely an attempt to amalgamate the two services
                    of the thought-to-be-more-glamorous diplomatic and thought-to-be-more-mundane
                    consular work. In doing this, they created eight ranks and an unclassified. And
                    everybody took the same examinations. Everybody was appointed into the Foreign
                    Service unclassified and at the same time they were commissioned as third
                    secretaries and vice consuls of... Incidentally, I have all those papers of all
                    my husband's commissions, all signed by the various Presidents and Secretaries
                    of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Then you went to unclassified C and you got to B and you got to A and then you
                    went into eight. It was called untenured as it is today, but once you made it to
                    eight — well, it was perhaps more easy to drop someone out when they were in the
                    unclassified. I never read the Rogers Act so I'm not absolutely certain how the
                    terms read, but as a result, all of us — not just husbands, but the wives too —
                    were eagerly watching the post lists and there was definitely a competitiveness
                    in the work world. This did not in any way shape or form affect anyone's
                    friendships. Is that enough of that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that's enough of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Just to say, once you knew you had your promotion and you knew what
                    your rank was, the other vice consul was a vice consul of B and you were A and
                    somebody didn't seat you right at the table, you didn't give a damn. It didn't
                    affect protocol, it only affected that you knew that you'd gone ahead a little
                    faster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the Rogers Act was a good thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I think it was an excellent thing. But as I said before, it never had a
                    chance to go through a whole generation. In about 1934, when it was ten years
                    old, at that time perhaps most of the people in class eight had probably come
                    into the Service under the Rogers Act, but those above class eight [classes 1-7]
                    had all come in under the old two services. In about 1934 or 5, the Foreign
                    Service of the Department of Commerce and the Foreign Service of the Department
                    of Agriculture were amalgamated in. This a lot of people either don't know or
                    forgot. They were amalgamated at the ranks they held. Therefore that put a bulge
                    in the Service from about class three down to class seven.</p>
                <p>And when you got to post-war, Commerce and Agriculture went back to their own
                    services. But they did not take back from the Foreign Service the bodies, the
                    persons who had come in pre-war. So that the man who had been commercial attach�
                    in post X in 1936, when in 1946 a separate Commerce Department Foreign Service
                    was reactivated, that man now in the Foreign Service did not get out of the
                    Foreign Service and go back to Commerce.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Then, very rightly, during the war years — I'm not certain of the dates and I'm
                    not certain whether it was a State Department edict or a Congressional one —
                    certainly there was no recruitment for the Foreign Service as such. There was a
                    very correct reason that all the young men at the time had to go to the Armed
                    Forces. Naturally there were some deferments for physical reasons, but I'm
                    certain that the feeling in the Department was that it was unfortunate that
                    someone had to be deferred physically, but it was not fair to those who had gone
                    into the armed forces to give this deferred person a chance to come into the
                    Service given that he was mentally equipped to do so. It was not fair because of
                    a physical defect that he should have a choice over the ones who had not been
                    able to apply.</p>
                <p>So there was no recruiting for a period of about — certainly four years, possibly
                    five. I'm not sure whether that began in 1940 or 1941. When the war was over,
                    the Department attempted to recruit into the Foreign Service persons from the
                    military services. And actually, these were again older people — older in the
                    sense that instead of being 22 or 23 they were 27 or 28. They had had the
                    experiences of the war and so again they were not brought in at the lowest
                    level, they were brought in according to their ranks and experiences. This made
                    another bulge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the Wriston Act did the same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Then the Wriston Act never even gave immediate post-war bulge a chance
                    to be absorbed. The idea was good if they had made it function because as the
                    Foreign Service became larger in the post-war years, there was certainly the
                    problem of the fact that an officer did not have as much chance of serving in
                    the Department as he had had when it was a much smaller Foreign Service. We only
                    served in Washington twice in over 40 years. And therefore the idea of making
                    more Departmental positions available to the Foreign Service — in other words,
                    one service for everything that had to do specifically with foreign affairs —
                    was fine except for the fact that — now I'm telling the hearsay, gossip of what
                    all of us have done — many of those people in the Department didn't want to go
                    abroad and the theoretical slots were not available until those people retired
                    or left. It really didn't ever amalgamate and what's happening now I haven't an
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you watched Wristonees come overseas, did they blend
                        into the post as well as people who had sort of come in from the beginning
                        and worked their way up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, with the exception of the couple of years we were attached to the
                    military, both of our overseas post-war posts were in very large embassies and
                    in both cases my husband was the DCM, so it's very hard for me to say really how
                    well 300 people mixed because I didn't know the 300 people. By happenstance of
                    my husband's service — he never served anywhere either as first secretary or as
                    counselor — so I didn't really ever have the experience of being a middle level
                    wife.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were either a very junior wife...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I was either a very junior wife... I was the most junior wife in
                    Belgrade and then the next post I was the wife of the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of most of your husband's work when you were a very
                        junior wife, it was consular as distinct from diplomatic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. I really don't count Havana because that was a temporary post and
                    all of the vice consuls there knew they were temporary. But we had five years in
                    Naples by which time there were vice consuls junior to us there, but when we
                    went from there to Belgrade, we were the most junior. And then we were in
                    Washington during the War, and then attached to the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I may sum up and then see because I want to go on with
                        something else. What I think I heard you say was that the Rogers Act and
                        these other acts were better in theory than they actually had time to become
                        in practice because each one was superseded by another one so that problems
                        were compounded rather than ameliorated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: None of the acts or plans ever was left alone long enough to see if it
                    was going to work. Somebody always tinkered with them. As I've said before, I
                    would think that the first appointees under the Rogers Act must have been men
                    who came into the Service in about '27 or '28. They would have been the ones who
                    were nearly at the top of the Service 30 years later. But in the meanwhile we
                    had three different amalgamations or lateral entries. The Foreign Service always
                    had a point and a bulge and a point. And the bulge of course kept going up as
                    there were more lateral entries. The lateral entries never came in at the
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a degree to which all of these sets of changes
                        affected anybody other than the employee except in the most indirect way? In
                        other words, did the Rogers Act and these other things — how directly did
                        they affect wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, obviously they were definitely affected as part of a family unit.
                    Let us say officer X is a class four. And let's say the class four at that time
                    had 400 people in it. And suddenly you take in another 300 laterally into that
                    class. That narrows the number of chances you have to go to class three. Because
                    they will also will take them in laterally as a three. They even took some
                    people in laterally as a one. So the original officer X saw his promotion
                    chances being constantly cut down because with the lateral entries, they didn't
                    bring the slots with them. They were supposed to, but they didn't. The
                    Wristonees — yes, they were amalgamated into the Service, but the jobs that they
                    did in Washington were not necessarily at the same time turned back over to be
                    Foreign Service jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so that meant that the family stayed overseas or
                        whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: But it also narrowed down the scope of promotion. Since we retired in
                    1973, of course, the whole thing's been changed again, and I haven't any idea
                    how it works.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't ask. [laughs]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I think the result of all of the changes is that we lost some very able
                    men. People who served with us have gotten out and gone to other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is even more true now than it was ten or
                        fifteen years, interestingly and ironically. That's quite a different
                        conversation. We talked last time about the growing perception among wives
                        of regimentation, and you made some comments indirectly about medical and
                        about education: That before the war there were no American schools and
                        there wasn't a medical facility that sort of regimented you. Would you
                        expand on that a little more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, it's easy to expand because it was non-existent. [laughs] When
                    you went to a post, you went to whatever local doctor [was] at the post. I guess
                    in most places where there was any immigration, they had a Public Health Service
                    doctor who was there for the purpose of examining the immigrants to see that
                    they were physically safe to admit into the United States. And most of those
                    doctors were only too glad to advise, but they couldn't take care of you. They
                    had no license to practice in the countries they were in. And I'm not sure how
                    they were chosen. They certainly were chosen for the purpose of examining
                    immigrants. They weren't chosen to be surgeons or something of that sort.</p>
                <p>So everywhere that I served until the last years in Naples, we always had the
                    local doctors. That's the doctors. True, we probably tended to have the same
                    doctors. I suppose most of the foreigners, not just the Americans, tended to
                    have the same doctors, either the Germans or the Swiss.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The same thing was true of the schools in post-war Rome. Some of the younger
                    wives with small children organized an American school, which as far as I know
                    is still thriving. But it was a private enterprise. It may now have some
                    government help, I don't know. But children were educated at home or in small
                    groups. I'm talking about very small children. There was the famous Calvert
                    System. There were at various places some international schools. They were apt
                    to be Swiss or French. The English have always all over the world for
                    generations sent their children by eight years old back to the UK, so that you
                    did not find English schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your son was born in 1934 in Italy. Now you were back
                        in this country when he really started school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I had the Calvert System for him as a small child in Belgrade and then
                    he had school over here in the war years. Then he was eleven when we went back
                    to Italy. And again I had the Calvert System and we had tutors for French and
                    Latin. And then he went to boarding school when he was thirteen I guess.
                    Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he had Calvert as a little boy, was he by himself and
                        you taught him, or were there several of you and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No I taught him. I offhand don't think there was another child... Well,
                    there were no children at AFHQ and then in Rome, the one year that he lived with
                    us there, there was no child exactly his age. There were younger children and
                    those mothers got together, as I said before, and started the little American
                    school. But those children were anywhere from three to ten perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever consider Italian schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No. Most Italian private schools at that time were what we would in
                    this country call parochial schools — church schools. And my husband actually
                    had been tutored by monks. His sister had gone to a Swiss school in Naples. But
                    we didn't feel that that was particularly the answer for our son. And as I said,
                    he had a Latin tutor and a French tutor. And the rest of what he needed was not
                    difficult to teach him. He lost out on a year of science, but that was not
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then you sent him off at thirteen. How did you feel at
                        the time to send a relatively young boy that far away? Was that difficult
                        for you to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, naturally any mother, particularly as while I'd been at AHFQ, I
                    had been really more with him than I might otherwise have been. But it was a
                    decision that had been made a long, long time before — that he would at the
                    appropriate time go to Andover. So that even had we been living in the States,
                    he might not have gone until he was fourteen. We might have waited one year
                    more. But he would have gone to boarding school in any case. So I can't remember
                    ever agonizing over it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I'd like to do now — I've been saving the best for
                        last, and it's a long last. The best, as far as I'm concerned is, I would
                        like to listen to you talk about the historical changes that you saw
                        starting in Italy and then in Belgrade leading up to the war, both as you
                        viewed them and, if you could give me some anecdotal material, too, about
                        your own. You told me not to start on history, but I really like that
                        [laughing], so I'd like to start on history. You arrived in Italy as
                        Mussolini was consolidating power if I remember my...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, he was fully in power by the time we got there, '34. Well, I'm
                    trying to think back to what I felt then as compared to afterthoughts now. I
                    can't think that I had been brought up with any great horror about dictators.
                    One always says at least he made the trains run on time. He did a number of very
                    beneficial social things in Italy. He had drained the Pontine Marshes and the
                    terrible malaria they had in that area was wiped out because once they got rid
                    of the mosquitoes... He'd settled a number of war veterans on these small
                    farms.</p>
                <p>Certainly at the time we arrived in Italy, there was no active opposition to
                    Mussolini within Italy. There were exile groups in Paris. We had a great many
                    Italian friends, partly because of my husband's own childhood there. We did not
                    know Italian officials. One, we were junior, and two, basically our government
                    policy did not encourage this. While it was not encouraging opposition, neither
                    was it blessing the dictator.</p>
                <p>We all knew, as I think I said earlier, that our phones were tapped. And we
                    certainly wouldn't have rushed out in the streets waving flags, “Down with the
                    Dictator,” or any activity of that sort. We were aware that people were jailed
                    and one young man we knew didn't show up for his black shirt drill and was put
                    in jail and his older brother said, “Serves him right for being lazy.” He was
                    released after a few days.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Ethiopian War, there's no doubt about it that the population
                    was definitely with Mussolini. We had a radio and he made a marvelous speech.
                    The sanctions that were then applied didn't work in any way, shape or form. We
                    may have had a little less gasoline, but it didn't impoverish the country and it
                    didn't bring it down or anything like that. And it had the affect of driving
                    Mussolini more into the arms of Hitler.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I might just deviate a momento Hitler because this is an absolutely true story
                    that's almost incredible. We had a German “schwester” — a trained baby nurse —
                    who had left Germany and her parents because she was strongly anti-Hitler, and
                    she had served with an English family for several years in England, and then she
                    came to us and was with us — well, about five years. She had been to the United
                    States with us and through all of this was stoutly anti-Hitler and never took
                    her holidays back in Germany. Her mother came out to see her in Italy.</p>
                <p>Oh, incidentally, she had been told by the German Consul that she must report
                    whatever went on in our house. And she came right away and told my husband about
                    this and he told her not to worry, nothing important went on worth reporting.
                    When Hitler came to Naples, she was ordered to be down at our railroad station
                    at X hour in the morning to cheer Hitler along the way. And then she was to go
                    to another point and so on, and I was very disturbed that she was going to be
                    all day. And I gave her a camp stool and a thermos and sandwiches and so on.</p>
                <p>She finally came back at 11 o'clock at night ecstatic, wild-eyed. She'd shaken
                    hands with Hitler and she was converted. This is an absolutely true story. She
                    went to Belgrade with us and when it was obvious that the war was going to break
                    out, I told her she'd have to leave us because there was no way that I could
                    arrange that she could be evacuated if we were, and I insisted that she had to
                    return to Germany which she did. I was in touch with her after the war and she
                    realized her dreadful mistake. The point I'm trying to make is the mesmerism of
                    Hitler.</p>
                <p>He also, in his own way, was very impressed with the Italian Navy which as it
                    steamed around the Bay of Naples was indeed an impressive sight. And of course
                    Germany had no Navy. So I think in many ways, Hitler felt that Italy would be a
                    stronger ally than they turned out.</p>
                <p>The Spanish Civil War was the first realization by my generation of the horrors
                    of war. The first thing that happened was that the Spanish Consul was forced to
                    resign as he did not support the Franco forces, not because he was a socialist,
                    but he said he had taken his oath to support the government, and support the
                    government he would. So he lost his job and could not go back to Spain. And of
                    course was persona non grata as far as the Italian government was concerned. And
                    I don't know what happened to him in the end. All of the consular corps in
                    Naples chipped in and put together some money for them and some clothing and
                    they were literally thrown out.</p>
                <p>The Spanish war was not popular. In fact it was so unpopular that the hospital
                    ships had to come in at night and the wounded would be unloaded when they could
                    not be seen by the general population. Then we left and went to Belgrade in
                    1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had it become apparent in Italy at that time that there
                        was going to be war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: To the man in the street, probably not. Certainly all the Italians
                    hoped that they would not be involved in it. At the time of Czechoslovakia, the
                    Munich Pact, the whole attitude of every Italian, whether he was fascist or
                    non-fascist, was just a great sigh of relief. For other Europeans, the Consular
                    Corps, it was obvious that this was simply a postponement.</p>
                <p>And by the time we got to Belgrade, again it was not an unsimilar situation.
                    Prince Paul was the regent for the young king. He, by his personal taste, was
                    certainly pro-Ally, but he was a realist. The dictator was again very definitely
                    a dictator. He was probably pro-German. But the country did remain neutral until
                    it was invaded by the Germans. When war broke out in the fall of '39, of course,
                    the diplomatic corps split in two: the Germans and the Italians on one side with
                    the French and English on the other side. We were not yet at war. And the
                    Italians shortly thereafter invaded Greece. I've forgotten the exact sequence of
                    events.</p>
                <p>But then we came along to the fall of France and that split the French Embassy in
                    two. It was a very interesting period to watch the developments, but what
                    Yugoslavia did or didn't do was very peripheral to the main events of the War.
                    And it would have made no difference had they come in or not come in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Starting in '37 or '38 in Italy, how much did this slowly
                        escalating set of tensions affect your daily lives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, again as I say, as we had not ever been encouraged nor did we
                    really have the rank, but even the Consul General, he and his wife were fluent
                    in Italian, did not see any of the high officials on anything except absolute
                    business. In terms of personal lives, it had very little affect. Our Italian
                    friends kept right on being our friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were primarily business people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. Or land owners. Well, they were young, I mean...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.. I mean the junior members of those families.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Several very large landowners and their children. Well, there were
                    several of them... Well this is only incidentally funny. [laughs] The older
                    sister of one of the families was married to a man who became aide to the
                    viceroy in Ethiopia, so they went down to stay in Addis Ababa. And she borrowed
                    a trunk from us because she didn't have any trunks. They were very poor. She
                    borrowed a trunk because she was a friend, not because her husband was the aide
                    to the viceroy, and it made no difference to me what her husband did.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In due course, the trunk got back to me and stamped all over it were “Aide to the
                    Viceroy, Ethiopia.” And when I got the trunk back after the war and traveled
                    with it to New York, there was some consternation in the Customs when this trunk
                    all labeled “Aide to the Viceroy, Ethiopia”... [laughter]. I had just not
                    thought to try to get the labels off. But that simply brings up my point. It had
                    no effect whatsoever on our personal relationships. We didn't stop seeing people
                    because of the fact that her husband was going to be aide to the viceroy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have large numbers of friends within the
                        Diplomatic Corps, and was it a fairly large group of people in Naples, or
                        was it a small corps and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It was, as far as I can remember, a rather small corps of — off-hand I
                    don't remember that there were any South Americans at that time. I may be wrong.
                    There may have been an Argentinean, for instance. There were Scandinavians,
                    Swiss, English and French, German. If there had been an Austrian, he disappeared
                    at the Anschluss [Germany's takeover of Austria].</p>
                <p>Other countries had then (and this doesn't really particularly have to do with
                    wives) a practice that in many ways I think it's a shame we don't do. They had a
                    great many honorary consuls of people who — well, the Norwegian was a Norwegian
                    shipping agent and he acted as an honorary consul for Norway as did his son in
                    post-war years. And many businessmen combined the function of being consul with
                    whatever their business was. I happen to think it's a good idea.</p>
                <p>Just recently in Spain we've closed Seville and we closed Malaga some years ago.
                    That means that if someone loses their passport and gets in an automobile
                    accident or anything of that sort, he has to apply to Madrid for any help. Now
                    these honorary consuls normally will issue visas. They don't — it depends on the
                    country, but they don't normally passports. But they give you the documents
                    permitting you to travel to somewhere where they do issue passports. And if you
                    lost your passport and had to go to Madrid to get a new one and you had to stop
                    in a hotel overnight, it's extremely difficult without a document.</p>
                <p>I needed to have a notary act for a document in the U.S. Had to send to Madrid
                    and have it sent back. Madrid would do it for me because they knew who I was,
                    but most people would have had to have gone with it to Madrid. Therefore this
                    function of the honorary consul in a great many cases is very useful. The
                    British do it to an enormous extent so that they have an official within reach
                    of almost anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Consular Corps within Naples a highly social corps
                        — including the honorary consuls?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well not highly social. The men used to lunch together, I forget
                    whether it was once a month or once a week. That is the officers, when I say the
                    men. As far as I know, there were not any female officers, but had there been,
                    it was an officers' luncheon. And they frequently invited an outside
                    distinguished guest to join them. If it was some kind of businessman who
                    happened to be vacationing there, or obviously if somebody's fleet came in, the
                    admirals onboard. And from time to time we had a social dinner. But it was not a
                    pressure thing. You went or not as you liked. We were much more, I think,
                    free-wheeling in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then when you got to Belgrade and you were both the most
                        junior, and it was getting clearer and clearer that there was going to be
                        war, what was living there like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, it was extremely interesting and... Well, I'll go back to when we
                    talked about what a woman's role was. We happened to have a very good short-wave
                    radio at that time, and we were living outside of the city on the hillside and
                    we had a tall antenna. So we got the best reception of anybody at the time of
                    the outbreak of the war and then again at the time of the invasion of France. I
                    had worked out when all of the different countries broadcast their news and in
                    what languages. So I could get the Russians in English and French and Italian,
                    and the BBC in English, French and Italian, and the Italians and so on. And
                    whenever there were moments of great crisis, I stayed all day at that radio and
                    telephoned down to the office.</p>
                <p>Mind you we didn't have the telephone communications that we have now. We didn't
                    have the same cable communications. So my news was always the first news that
                    the office had of what was happening in some place. We had also, because of the
                    Yugoslavs' neutral position, had all of the important newspaper people traveling
                    back and forth on their way to Bucharest, on their way to Budapest, on their way
                    to Athens. So we heard a great deal of what was going on even though we were
                    seemingly isolated.</p>
                <p>As I said, the diplomatic corps was split, but America was neutral. It just
                    happened that the Italians were our particularly good friends. The diplomatic
                    corps was also very mixed in the nationality of the husbands and wives. The wife
                    of the German — I've forgotten what his rank was — but in any case, he was the
                    Nazi Party head. He wasn't the ambassador, but he was the head of the Party
                    under an assumed rank, and she was an American, so it was very difficult for
                    her. The Belgian Ambassador's wife was Italian. There was a great deal of strain
                    in that sense, the mixed marriages. The English Minister then was a bachelor.
                    The French had the most difficult time insofar as the fall of France. They split
                    right down the Embassy, some remaining with the one government and some
                    remaining with the other. The wives weren't ordered out. Our government sent a
                    ship to Ireland and a ship to Genoa and said these were the last ships that
                    would be sent and urged...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what, 1940?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: 1940 in June. And urged the wives and children to leave. Our Minister,
                    who was Arthur [Bliss] Lane, absolutely insisted that the children go. But he
                    left it up to the wives to do as they wished. So I and one other mother left and
                    I took with me the children of the wives who didn't leave because I had the
                    youngest child, though I didn't want to go. Obviously I was the one who had to
                    go. I couldn't give the youngest child to someone else. It was '40; he was
                    six.</p>
                <p>But many of my friends were leaving the northern part of Europe at the same time.
                    And it was a very interesting trip back from my point of view because we had
                    known Dorothy Thompson. She had married with Sinclair Lewis, and in his book
                    Dodsworth he tells of his life with her. And they lived, he and she, in the
                    Dodsworth book in the house we lived in in Naples, and it's described in that
                    book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he actually lived in it after you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, years before. At the time he was writing Dodsworth, he lived in our
                    house and Dorothy Thompson lived in the little house next to it. It's so
                    perfectly described. They also filmed the film in the garden at the property.
                    That sequence in Dodsworth. I don't know if Dodsworth is still in print or
                    not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've never seen it, so I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Sinclair Lewis died in Florence after the war and he and Dorothy
                    Thompson were divorced by then. But they had a child. She was already, if not
                    divorced from him, separated at the time. She was the correspondent for the New
                    York Tribune. She was on the ship and our ambassador [inaudible]. But they very
                    kindly asked me to join them in the evening, and they were both in communication
                    with the U.S.</p>
                <p>The captain would not allow any news bulletins to be published because there were
                    so many refugees on board from mixed countries that he was afraid that if any
                    news, bad news, got out, it would cause a great deal of disturbance on
                    shipboard. So instead of having the daily news which you did on most ships, we
                    had none.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so by sitting with them, you were able to find

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long a trip was it? A week?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Perhaps a little bit longer because all ships at that time were held in
                    Gibraltar for inspection. And then we traveled, of course, with lights and a red
                    cross on the side. We didn't have any troubles. I mean, in other words,
                    submarines didn't follow us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you afraid that they would?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well they had stopped the ship before us, about ten days before we
                    sailed, and made everybody get into the lifeboats, but they didn't do anything.
                    Well, obviously these refugees were very nervous. They were Czechs, they were
                    Poles, they were German Jews. And they were very unhappy, miserable human
                    people, not being at all sure what was going to happen to them when they got
                    here. Some of them had no means...</p>
                <p>The ship was crowded. They had beds in the swimming pool. It wasn't exactly a
                    luxury crossing. But, on the other hand, we had perfectly adequate meals,
                    served, not standing in line, and they had a good bar, and you could get any
                    drinks you could afford to buy. The cabins were of course crowded. We were five
                    in a three-bed cabin with a cot. It wasn't horrible in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were the children that you bought home with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I had a little girl thirteen and a little boy twelve and another very
                    nice, very responsible boy of fifteen. And they couldn't have obeyed better
                    anyway, they... I took a deck chair [laughs] and I said, “Now you have to report
                    to me every hour because I can't run all over this ship looking for where you've
                    gone, nor do I expect you to sit on the deck all day. But you must come back
                    every hour on the hour and tell me where you're going to be next.” And they came
                    without fail always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they help keep track of your six-year old?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, he was much too young for them to have any... He was six years
                    younger than the youngest. They weren't interested in him. They went off and
                    played shuffleboard or deck tennis or whatever there was. There was no swimming
                    pool. They weren't mean to him or anything like that, but it simply was not —
                    there was too much age gap. And they hadn't known him in Belgrade. His friends
                    had been younger children.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that we're asking everybody that we talk
                        with is the effect that you think that growing up in this manner had on your
                        children or your child in this case, both in its positive and in its
                        negative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Of course I've known a great many Foreign Service children. Obviously,
                    it has its effect. Anything you do anywhere has its effect. I think that our
                    generation of Foreign Service children probably... The saddest effect, and I use
                    that word deliberately, is that they didn't make life-long friends. Now I'm not
                    sure given the mobility of the U.S. population today that any children ever live
                    very long anyplace, but certainly of the Foreign Service children including my
                    son that I've known, very few of them have friends that go back to the years
                    that they were anywhere — well, prior to college, let's say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the other hand I get the feeling talking with you that
                        you and your husband considered your son a part of a group of people who
                        were at least adult life-long friends, even though you didn't necessarily
                        all serve in the same place. I get that feeling listening to you talk
                        about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well that is because, at that time, my husband's contemporaries were a
                    much more homogenous group. We were individuals within it, but in general,
                    everybody that we knew, every man had been to college...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More or less to the same colleges? They had even known
                        each other in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Many of them had gone to the same colleges, though in terms of my
                    husband, nobody from his class at Yale as far as I know came into the Foreign
                    Service. Some before and some after, but not actually of his class. But some of
                    the wives I've known here in Washington... We tended to... Lots of people from
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your long-term friends tend to be the people who had
                        served in Europe, or did you have friends who had also been a part of the
                        Asian or the Middle-Eastern — I don't want to use the word Mafia, but you
                        know what I mean, within the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, obviously you tended to know... We never served twice with the
                    same people at a post, let's put it that way. People we were with we never saw
                    anywhere else, the people we were with at Naples — well, with one exception —
                    Outerbridge Horsey was in Naples and in Rome very briefly. On the whole, it was
                    more a question of... We met up in Washington or we joined each other for
                    holidays somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or you contacted by mail.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Or we visited each other at our various posts. We went several times to
                    stay in Paris with friends. We saw friends when we went to London, people came
                    to stay with us, not in Belgrade [laughs], but in Rome and Madrid. And there was
                    another thing about those days that was particular, I noticed the last trip my
                    husband and I took. We used to, as we went around the world anywhere, partly by
                    courtesy and... You stopped by the Embassy and let them know you were in the
                    country. And it usually turned out that you knew somebody there, and usually
                    that somebody said, “Come to lunch,” or the ambassador said, “Come to a
                    reception,” or... You tended to keep in touch.</p>
                <p>This last trip we took, we had to get a visa. We didn't realize a diplomatic
                    passport had to have a visa to Uruguay or someplace, and so we went up to the
                    Embassy in Lima. We were retired. And it couldn't have been more helpful in
                    terms of getting us the visa. But we went through about three iron gates, armed
                    people, and we finally were taken to a glass-enclosed aquarium all around the
                    outside where people could see in, and the officer came down and was very
                    apologetic that he couldn't take us to his office, but they could see no
                    visitors whatsoever except in this glass aquarium. That's all we saw of the
                    Embassy in Lima.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And nobody invited you to anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't even think you're allowed to see the list of who was assigned
                    there. So if our best friend had been there, we wouldn't have known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unless you had known in advance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: If you stopped by the Embassy and you asked to see somebody, well,
                    comparable to what you might be, and they usually recognized your name and they
                    had the book anyway, they could look you up, and then you said, “Who's assigned
                    here?” and you found that somebody you'd been with ten years ago...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you called them and they said, “Do come over for
                        dinner, for a drink” or whatever. When you went back to Europe after the
                        war, what sorts of changes did you... I mean obviously you came into the
                        Embassy at a different...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I have to put a rather wide parenthesis there. When we left the
                    U.S. on the ship, and that was a trip, we were assigned to the Embassy in Rome.
                    Alexander Kirk was the Chief of Mission. He wasn't called ambassador because the
                    peace treaty had not been signed, so he was High Commissioner, I think it was.
                    And midstream, which we didn't know, our assignment was changed, and when we got
                    to Naples, my husband was told he'd been assigned to AFHQ — Armed Forces
                    Headquarters South. That was at Caserta outside of Naples. Well, at that point
                    complete chaos reigned because no women were allowed to be assigned to the Armed
                    Forces. Italian friends of ours put us up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By no women, you mean the wives couldn't go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: That's right. And the hotels were requisitioned and so on and so forth.
                    So in any case, we went to stay with Italian friends while this thing was sorted
                    out. And my husband was assigned a hut up in the gardens, but no women, no
                    wives. And I could stay either with the WACS or the nurses. And we had a child,
                    an 11-year old. Well, the Ambassador — High Commissioner — had requisitioned
                    billeting in Naples, and when he became aware of the predicament, he turned it
                    over to us. That is a long story of marvelous reminiscences, which don't have to
                    do with here. But the long and the short of it was — I just have to put in
                    one.</p>
                <p>After we'd been there a couple of weeks and I'd gotten my old Italian cook back,
                    and that again is another wonderful story, and my old bread man came down. The
                    guards would not let him in and he told the guards he'd served my mother-in-law
                    and me and that I liked a certain kind of fresh bread from the country. And I
                    liked fresh eggs and he was bringing them because he heard I was back, so that
                    was fine.</p>
                <p>Then we gave the commanding American general and the commanding English general a
                    dinner. And it was a very good dinner. And they both complimented me on it and
                    asked how did I manage to prepare this dinner on rations. And I said I didn't
                    have any rations whereupon consternation blew up all over the place. No rations
                    whatsoever with a child there, etc., etc. And I said I didn't need rations. Oh,
                    but you cannot eat on the economy. And I said, “But you see I can eat on the
                    economy.” “No, you can't eat on the economy.” And I said, “Well if I don't have
                    rations, what I am going to eat on?” “The town mayor will fix that up tomorrow.”
                    And indeed the town mayor hove to and fixed it up.</p>
                <p>The smallest unit they could figure out was, every five days I could go down and
                    get what twenty-five men could eat. So if I got Chicken Day, I got chickens for
                    twenty-five men. If I got Spam Day, I got Spam for twenty-five men. As I had no
                    mess sergeant — by then we'd gotten a jeep — I drove the jeep and I found it
                    advisable to take my son with me and drove out to what they call the “dump,”
                    then filled out umpteen million forms and drove around the piles, loaded up the
                    jeep and came back with the food. And I was there for about — over a year before
                    wives began turning up.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With all of these piles of food. You didn't go every five
                        days did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes because I wanted the flour and the rice and the soap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do with all of this extra food?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, for a long time the fishermen were delighted to have the Spam and
                    bring me fresh fish, and they fished right under the rocks at the villa. And the
                    soap I could change for broccoli and so on. [laughs]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] So you had your own sort of slow exchange.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. I never put things on the black market in the sense of cigarettes
                    and things of that sort which then they would have taken away and sold. It was
                    simply a question of bartering what I had too much of for what they didn't have.
                    And soap was something that is very precious and what was I going to do with
                    soap for twenty-five men every five days?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, that you didn't need. So you were there for two years?
                        That was a two-year tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, AFHQ as such began to fade out. The Italian Peace Treaty was
                    signed in '47.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back in '45?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And stayed at the Headquarters until the fall of '46 and by then it was
                    pretty much fading out. My husband had to go frequently to Rome. Originally he
                    went to Rome once a week and there was more work at Caserta. But then the
                    American forces moved to Leghorn, the British forces moved to Verona. And when
                    it became apparent that he was spending more time in the North than he was in
                    Caserta, we moved up to Rome, and then when that faded out entirely and the
                    Embassy opened, we were already in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was the Deputy Chief of Mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you spell Caserta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Caserta. But that's a whole book in itself. We had no icebox, no hot
                    water. I never saw a [inaudible] in the house. [laughs] I had my own personal
                    Air Corps guards, Italian, not the U.S. Government's. And those are all
                    wonderful stories, but they're not typically Foreign Service stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you were going to tell a pre-war typically Foreign
                        Service story, and then I'm going to ask you to tell a post-war Foreign
                        Service story. Having said that this period wasn't typical, I'll grant you,
                        but I'm not sure there is such a thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, pre-war, and this sounds dull, I can think of lots of pleasant
                    evenings that we spent with colleagues playing bridge. Life was peaceful. No
                    this AFHQ period was uniquely different from any kind of life at all that
                    anybody lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the quiet evenings playing bridge apply to Belgrade
                        in the period leading up to your evacuation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Oh yes. The Belgian Ambassador and his wife loved to play bridge. And
                    frequently came to play. There was no opera in Belgrade. A German company came
                    down and we went, and in Naples, as I said earlier, we went frequently to the
                    opera, every year. Well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've made your point, which is what I was trying to get
                        at which is what was sort of typical. After the war, when you moved up to
                        Rome, this was a change in status in that your husband, from being at the
                        bottom of a consulate or legation, had gone to almost the top of an embassy
                        which carried with it a different sort of role for him. Did this affect you
                        and what you did and your... How much would you say of your life in Rome was
                        determined by that, and how much of it was the fact that Rome was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well a whole lot obviously. Well, as I said earlier, I happen to have
                    been blessed in Service years with four marvelous “chiefesses” [principal
                    officers' wives]. In my entire service, I only served under one dull woman. And,
                    thank goodness, briefly. But Mary Dunn was a wonderful person to serve with and
                    when she got there, she asked me to come over and have a talk with her. And she
                    explained exactly what she wanted and what she expected me to do. And left it to
                    me to arrange how I was going to do it — never interfered. And was always
                    available when I went to her and said, “Mary, I think you're going to have to do
                    this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it she wanted? Could you spell that out a little
                        bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Oh. Essentially she told me what she wanted and so on. By then we were,
                    well, certainly more than 150 officers and it was quite impossible for Mary to
                    talk about protocol, to receive all those women who came to call. And we worked
                    out a pattern agreeable to her and to myself that I would report directly to
                    Mary. I asked all the wives of the heads of sections in the Embassy to report to
                    me. I couldn't receive the 180 wives either. And I asked each of the section
                    chiefs' wives to please know personally the wives of each officer serving under
                    their husbands. And then if there were any problems they could come to me, and
                    if I couldn't solve the problem, I would take it to Mary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By problems, you mean...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I'm now going to give the illustration of the only one I took to
                    Mary. We had one older wife whose husband's rank was not very far up, but they
                    had been in the Service a number of years. And she had never been at a post
                    where she had not personally been received by the head of the post. And she was
                    bitterly resentful of the fact that she didn't see Mrs. Dunn personally. So I
                    asked her husband's — her section wife to bring her to tea with me, but that
                    wasn't enough. And I then went to Mary and told her exactly the story, and I
                    said, “There's this one wife to whom it makes a great deal of personal
                    difference to see her alone and not just at a large reception. Do you mind? I
                    cannot help with it.” And Mary said, “Of course, I understand the problem
                    entirely. Bring her to tea next Thursday,” or whenever it was we went to tea
                    with Mary. And that solved that. The woman had personally been received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was out of a different school and she was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Much older than I. As I say, her husband had not gone up the ladder as
                    fast as some others. And she — [laughs] rank and all the rest of it — she just
                    felt she had to be personally seen by the ambassadress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: But most of the time, if the section chief's wife couldn't handle it,
                    usually if they came out and we talked it all over, it straightened itself out
                    without having to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the section chief's wife couldn't handle it, what sort
                        of thing was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Oh, spats between wives and who was going to be what at the school or
                    who was going to run the Red Cross bazaar or...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sort of thing. Did the section chiefs' wives assume
                        that this was their role — I mean that they had this kind of sub-leadership
                        responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well some did better than others and obviously the ones that did it
                    better had less reason to bring the problems to me. You can't turn everybody
                    into the same mold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] No, you surely can't. But it was assumed at that
                        point that there was sort of a parallel informal wives' structure that
                        paralleled the husbands' formal structure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well I think most people did it... Well, in many cases they genuinely
                    liked the other wives. This doesn't mean to say that they didn't mix. It was
                    only somebody had to have somewhere they could go if they had a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh sure. If you know that somebody's got a very sick child
                        and they need community support...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sort of thing as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. But with that many people, one person can't do it all plus the
                    other things unless it's someone who's running an office and sits in the
                    embassies. I think they now have nurses or somebody to do that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well yes, they can do it at certain levels. They can't
                        necessarily do it at the — how shall I put it — “good neighbor” sort of
                        support system. But yes, there's some of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I mean I'm perfectly frank and honest about it. I'm sure that there
                    were wives at the Embassy that I didn't see more than a few times a year and
                    only at large receptions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And maybe weren't sure who they were.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, we were pretty good about that, all of us trying to know who the
                    other person was by name. But I wasn't sure that they had these children or that
                    child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Naples as the Consul General's wife in
                        1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: '72? Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the 1972 directive on the role of wives
                        and whether, when it was issued, it had any effect where you were at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't think I ever saw it. If I did, I paid no attention to it. But
                    we were a very small group there and we didn't have any organizational structure
                    whatsoever in Naples. How many of us were there? Possibly eight officers? Ten?
                    If you counted all the [inaudible] I guess. I had each when they arrived to tea
                    with me and chatted and talked. But there was no wives' luncheon, there was no
                    men's luncheon. By then they had a canteen in the basement of the office and
                    most of them seemed to lunch there.</p>
                <p>We had a women's meeting for a Christmas party which we organized and gave. But
                    that was basically volunteer and there were one or two wives who didn't want to
                    participate in it. And nobody forced them to. We raised a kitty. We asked
                    everybody in the office to contribute some money and then some went out and
                    bought the presents, and some wrapped them and some made the cookies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a children's party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. It was for the Italian children. I think we let the American
                    children come, but I don't think they got presents. I've forgotten now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when we arrived in Kuala Lumpur and I had been
                        all primed because I had taken the wives' course. And I had a lovely blue
                        linen dress that I had bought specifically to come call on you.
                        [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And what happened? It was awful?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, nothing. It was nicer than coming and calling in the
                        formal sense. We got a message within 24 hours after we'd gotten there,
                        would Dan and I come together and have drinks in the evening? And that would
                        be my call. And it was a very nice thing to do. I remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: We usually did that there, but I didn't do that in Naples because in KL
                    we did have that luncheon group so that I had the time and saw the wives
                    independently, whereas in Naples, as we had no organizational group, and as
                    Homer and I by circumstance saw a great deal more of Italian officials — well,
                    we both spoke Italian and so on — I didn't have as much — I didn't do as much
                    with whatever the wives were doing. And there was a rather large gap in ages
                    again, too, but by '72... Shall we go down and have a drink?</p>
                <p>

                <p>Continuation of interview: March 22, 1989</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, this is the continuation of the interview with
                        Mrs. Homer Byington and it is the 22nd of March and we are now sitting in my
                        living room. And you were just commenting about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well I've been thinking the last two weeks of our previous
                    conversation. And your questions about what Foreign Service life abroad was like
                    during my years. And the more I've thought about this, and the more I've thought
                    about the articles I read in the State Department Bulletin and the list of
                    courses that are offered, I began to think that there's something — I'm not the
                    first of course to say this — that something is wrong with American education.
                    The wives seem to have endless counseling or they seem to be told how they can
                    bring up their children, what doctors are available, all about what housing will
                    be like. And all in all, not only before they leave Washington, but there seems
                    to be all sort of supporting activities arranged at every post.</p>
                <p>I read the questions in, I believe it's called “Ask Dr. Dustin,” and they say,
                    “What do we do about our child's earache?” Well, in my day, if your child had an
                    earache, you found a doctor and took your child to a doctor. And I wonder
                    whether the present-day wife is incapable of doing this by herself or whether
                    she's so bewildered by all the things she's being told that she's lost track of
                    how to do it by herself. Surely they don't need all that amount of
                    counseling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an interesting point, because I've made some of my
                        living — the independent money that I've earned — in parts of this kind of
                        counseling. And the counseling has developed because people felt like they
                        didn't have enough information to make judgments. And they wanted to know a
                        little bit more about what, say, the doctors were like in Naples. Or what
                        the source of medicine available to them as a family was like in Lusaka. And
                        how to... They seemed to want more information so that they could then make
                        up their own minds.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Supposing they decided that they didn't like the post. Then what does
                    the wife say, “I'm not going to go”?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of them are saying that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: So then it's a question of whether they want to be with their husbands
                    or don't want to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some cases, or whether the couple stays with the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, that of course, is always the alternative. Well, [laughs], let's
                    go back a long way. How about our ancestors who went across the prairie in the
                    covered wagon? They didn't stop to ask whether there were doctors at the gold
                    mines when they got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. I'm not disagreeing with you. I think there are people
                        who are saying, “Since information can be made available, we would like to
                        have it.” I think that some talk about the kinds of things that are common
                        to people who move from one place to another, the kinds of adjustments that
                        they make, the kinds of aspects of culture that they can learn, I think this
                        helps people do it with more grace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I don't know whether today there still exists what was known as
                    the post report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does. It's limited in its...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Ours was a fairly detailed. And it was written, at least in my time,
                    the wives were asked to contribute to it in terms of things that they would know
                    about that the man wouldn't. What sort of foods were generally available,
                    probably what the prices of the foods were. That particularly occurs to me.
                    Maybe we wrote something about what clothing was available. I don't remember the
                    details. I do remember about the food. And those reports usually carried a
                    review of what medical facilities were available. I think perhaps, and again I'm
                    not sure, a little more thought was given to where people were transferred.
                    Usually families with small children were not sent to the so-called “unhealthy
                    posts.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a smaller system and there were fewer posts
                        also.</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, Africa comes to my mind because of two people that I knew were
                    there. And both men were sent ostensibly as bachelors. It turned out that one
                    had a wife and hadn't told the Department about it. But that was not the
                    Department's fault. [laughs] But normally in some of those more primitive posts,
                    the junior officers with young wives and therefore the possibility of young
                    families were not sent. I wasn't familiar with the Far East, and as I say,
                    Africa was nearby. [laughs] There was one thing...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do a lot of informal sharing of information? In
                        other words, if you heard that somebody was coming to Naples, did you write
                        them a letter or did they write you a letter which you then answered? How
                        did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well that divides into two parts. If you were transferred to X and you
                    knew somebody who'd been in X, you asked them anything they could possibly tell
                    you. And frequently you would have a colleague at your post that had been there.
                    Secondly, if you were transferred, you usually wrote what was basically a
                    courtesy letter to the wife of the head of the post. Not always by any means,
                    but frequently. And that was answered telling you anything that might not have
                    occurred to the post report...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or that needed to be updated because the post...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. It wasn't always answered by the wife herself. She may have put a
                    covering note and said, “I've asked so-and-so to send you this new information.”
                    But there wasn't any rule about it. And of course as you went on up in the
                    Service you almost always knew somebody at the post you were going to. As there
                    got to be more people and you as a person had already met more people... It was
                    done more informally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect some of the training now is in response to the
                        fact that the system is so much larger that it is more difficult to make it
                        work informally. That people who go from, say Singapore to Bujumbura may not
                        know anybody in Bujumbura and there may not be anybody in Singapore who does
                        know somebody, so that the informal networking maybe doesn't work quite as
                        accurately as it did in a smaller Service where people knew each other more.
                        Or is that — a view on my part?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: I wouldn't really have a knowledge of today's Service to be able to
                    answer. I was thinking more of the lists of courses that seem to be being given
                    within the Foreign Service Institute. Which for me personally would not work at
                    all. I would not be able to go and listen to being told exactly how to do this,
                    that and the other thing. We had rather intensive language instruction in Malay
                    because that was not a usually spoken language. And I suppose they give courses
                    in French and Spanish and all the rest of them. And if one has the time in
                    Washington before going overseas to learn a few words of... I think that's a
                    great help, if only because you can....</p>
                <p>I was so proud of myself when we landed in KL and got off the plane and I had a
                    beautiful phrase which I... All I remember was something like “Gowan gluff
                    gluff,” [laughs] but in any case I said, “The clouds are dark today.” And I
                    pulled out my phrase with great pleasure and the Chief of Protocol spoke
                    impeccable English [laughter] so my “gowan gowan gluff gluff” was not very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>But I do think it's appreciated in any country if you can speak something in
                    their language. The language yes, I agree with. But I can't help but feel that
                    some of those other courses are redundant, that many... We talked about this
                    before. We were talking about changes in the Foreign Service. I'm not sure that
                    there are any greater changes in the Foreign Service per se than there are in
                    the actual life in the U.S. So I think it would be an error to overstress that
                    the Service itself has changed. I think it has simply changed to the degree that
                    life in general has changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad you've made that point because one of the things
                        when we begin to pull this thing together as a book, one of the points which
                        I think we can make is that the Foreign Service serves in a great many ways
                        as a very good microcosm for looking at some of the rather drastic changes
                        that have taken place in the society at large over fifty years. Particularly
                        in relation to women and women's work. Probably the single most complicated
                        issue that faces the contemporary Foreign Service is the question of
                        employment for women who are wives of Foreign Service officers, who in the
                        normal course of life in this country, and not moving around, would be
                        employed in their own capacity... And this particular issue has caused as
                        much long-term difficulty and reshaped the Foreign Service as much as
                        anything else I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well that of course is a much-disputed topic today. I think it was just
                    Sunday's Post had a long article on the “Mommy Track.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It's a very complicated issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And until it's solved internally, it'll be very difficult to solve it
                    externally.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean within the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, I mean until it's been solved within the United States, it can't be
                    solved in our foreign posts. I suppose the working mother earns enough to pay
                    the attendants of the Day Care and I suppose the attendants at the Day Care earn
                    enough to pay a less expensive Day Care where they leave their children. But at
                    some point, you come to the end of the line. Somebody's going to have to stay
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's very complicated. I think that this leads to
                        a question that you have raised sort of tangentially, occasionally, and I
                        wanted you to come back to, if you don't mind, and this has to do with
                        education and demographics within the Foreign Service. You talked earlier of
                        a fairly homogeneous group of people in the pre-war Foreign Service. Same
                        general kinds of education. General social background that was fairly common
                        to the group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I'm not entirely in accord. It seems to me we had more eccentrics and,
                    until we got up to the McCarthy period, nobody particularly thought of this
                    being eccentric, you know. All of them had to have a good education. But I can
                    think of one man who...Well, first he graduated from Cambridge. Then he went to
                    MIT. Then he went from MIT, and that is more business training, he went on and
                    got a doctor of philosophy. So he was roughly five years older than the average
                    in his entering class. He was slightly eccentric. I can think of, oh any number
                    who... But they all had a basic good education or they couldn't have passed the
                    exams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think that eccentricity is one thing and I guess
                        what I'm meaning by what I think I'm seeing in terms of... They tended to
                        come from upper middle class or what some people might use the term “East
                        Coast Establishment” families. This didn't exclude eccentrics, but it was a
                        kind of common background that meant they started with some common
                        understandings of how one did things, how society worked, that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: That's partially right, though not entirely. Just incidentally, by law
                    at that time, no one could come into the Foreign Service who had not been an
                    American citizen for, I've forgotten how many years. But in other words, it was
                    almost impossible for a naturalized citizen to have come into the Service.
                    Whatever the number of years was was such that someone... Because you can't
                    become naturalized until you're 21, at least that's what it used to be. It might
                    be 18 now.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>And so, if the waiting period was ten years, twenty years, whatever it was,
                    someone who became naturalized at the age of 21 wouldn't have been able to come
                    into the Service until they were over 30 and they were unlikely to do that. Now
                    that law, which was a law and not just a local rule, was abolished and the
                    result is that there have been a great many more persons in the Service in
                    recent years of non-American, in terms of living in the territory of the United
                    States, background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I would say probably a broader geographical base
                        across the United States too. And, while education not necessarily as much
                        from the same East Coast schools. Partly again as a factor of numbers and
                        partly as some deliberate cultural diversity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, again I think that's reflected by U.S. foreign interests. Our
                    interests from 1900 until World War II were largely directed toward Europe and
                    China/Japan. India, after all, was part of the British Empire that was coped
                    with through London. Africa — we had perhaps some commercial interests, but
                    certainly no political interests prior to World War II. We had some interests in
                    Middle East oil.</p>
                <p>There were large parts of the globe that the United States wasn't interested in
                    per se and didn't have any reason to be interested in at that time. Therefore,
                    you tended to have people from the West Coast who knew about China and Japan or
                    people from the East Coast who knew about Europe on the other side. But
                    throughout the middle of the United States, they probably were not as interested
                    in foreign affairs. Therefore, it didn't occur to them that they would want to
                    have a career outside of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see as many changes out of the Wriston Program in
                        terms not only of husbands but of wives as you think happened out of the
                        1924 changes in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well after all I didn't really come into the Service until '32, so it
                    was already supposedly an amalgamated Service or had been for eight years. So
                    what it was like before '24 I really... [laughs]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You only know what you've heard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I mean I didn't live it myself. I would say a large number of the wives
                    that I knew in the Service had come in before the, what was it called, '24 Act.
                    From a Wristonee point of view — well there were so many in terms of... I
                    haven't the numbers in my mind, but I would think that it probably at least
                    doubled the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More than that I think if I've seen the numbers
                        right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Whereas the '24 Act amalgamated two bodies that were already people
                    serving abroad. That the amalgamation didn't always go smoothly was another
                    matter. But nobody was overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about the reasons it didn't go
                        smoothly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: There were utterly different types of examinations for the two
                    services. I never saw the exams but they were different because the
                    day-to-day... Well, let me go back to something we did have then, and I would
                    love to run the State Department. We used to have local vice consuls who were
                    people, American citizens, but who lived in the places where they were
                    appointed. In other words, they didn't take exams and we used to call them
                    non-career vices. They were always going to be vice consuls. Very rarely were
                    they ever transferred, primarily because they didn't want to be.</p>
                <p>They were either people who had married locally or for various reasons wanted to
                    stay where they were. And they did do a great deal of the mundane part of the
                    consulate work, which, it is allowed, is mundane. And therefore even the junior
                    career officer began to issue visas or... He usually had the assistance of the
                    local [non-career vice consul] when he went out to protect Americans. But I
                    think the career junior officer was in a more important position in his work
                    than they are today when we no longer have these... And since I've left the
                    Service, I don't know what's become of the Staff Corps, which was sort of
                    created to cover that non-career vice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh it's very much there. And then there is a local staff
                        as well...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Oh I'm not talking about the local staff, because in terms of the
                    consulate, the local staff cannot issue visas and passports. No, I was talking
                    about the administrative side of the office. Who goes out and hires the
                    charwomen and so on. It used to be to a great extent handled by the so-called
                    non-career vices. Which now frequently falls into the lap of a career officer
                    and he thinks to himself that, “This is not what I joined the Foreign Service
                    for.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] That's probably true.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And then returning to the amalgamation of '24, those people who had
                    been in the Diplomatic Service never had any of that more mundane aspect of
                    their service, and I have to say in all honesty [laughs] although my dear
                    father-in-law wouldn't like it, that they probably were better educated than
                    many of the old-time consuls. So that there was bound to be...</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>They'd come in to do different types of jobs. Their backgrounds had been the
                    reason why they selected going into either one service or the other. And it was
                    only when they took everybody in on the same examinations did it become feasible
                    to really assign people to either service. But somebody who had spent fifteen or
                    twenty years in the Diplomatic Service and had become first secretary in Rome
                    wasn't really going to want to be sent to be consul in Frankfurt, say, even
                    though Frankfurt's a nice town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a post when you had people who had come — in the '30's
                        — when you had people who had come in, some of them from the Diplomatic
                        Corps and some from the Consular Corps — was there tension among them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, not tension. No, it was simply a question of feeling that...
                    Well, all right, start off this way. The capitals of any country are usually the
                    more glamorous cities of any country, and therefore those people who were not
                    assigned the capitals wondered why all the ABCs got posts in the capitals and
                    the XYZs didn't. And when it was attempted to mix them up a little bit, as I
                    say, the man who'd spent fifteen or twenty years and was a first secretary in
                    Rome was going to find the work in Frankfurt boring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it just wasn't his work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It wasn't what he'd done for all this time. I think that it was more a
                    question of which were the nicer posts. My father-in-law served in Hull and
                    Liverpool and Leeds and Bristol as consul at various times in his career. He
                    never served in London. Now Leeds I'll risk cannot be compared with living in
                    London whether you're an automobile salesman or a beautiful pianist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughs] Exactly. I wonder if we could talk a little bit
                        about post-war Rome and then talk about Kuala Lumpur briefly. And then you
                        asked me to ask you to tell the story of the smuggled dog.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well let me tell the smuggled dog now, because he fits into post-war
                    Rom[laughs] The whole Foreign Service is human and there must have been times in
                    Foreign Service life when every one of us broke some law. But we had...

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Let me just quickly go back about... There are so many fascinating Foreign
                    Service things. Frugal was born in Naples just before we were transferred to
                    Belgrade. And I also had her father and mother. So when we went to Belgrade we
                    went with three dogs. And at the time that I had to leave Belgrade, Frugal was
                    the smallest one, still only a year old, and was the one my young son loved
                    dearly. So we took Frugal back with us to the U.S. and that was in '40. Well
                    that was no problem. But in '45 when we were sent back to Italy, we went on a
                    ship called the “Gripsholm” that was chartered from the Swedish and filled with
                    the Red Cross that evacuated people from the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My father-in-law was evacuated on that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Rickety old firetrap it was, but in any case... Of course all of the
                    reservations and everything like that were arranged through the Department, and
                    my husband went into New York to pick up the tickets. And the New York end of it
                    was being handled by what had been the Export line before the war. Because of
                    the Export line in Naples, he knew a lot of the people.</p>
                <p>So he said he wanted to pay the extra fare for the dog which naturally the
                    Department wouldn't pay for. And my husband was going to pay the extra fare. And
                    the man whom he knew behind the counter said, “You have no dog.” And he looked
                    very firmly at my husband. And he said, “I know nothing about your having a dog.
                    I repeat, I know nothing about your having a dog.” So my husband got the idea,
                    came back and told us his story, and we then began practicing every night with
                    Frugal at cocktail hour. She was put in a hatbox and put down in the middle of
                    the room and everybody talked all around her, and she had to stay quiet in the
                    hatbox.</p>
                <p>So it worked. We got down to the dock and took Frugal and put her in the hatbox,
                    and the hatbox went away with the luggage. And because it was just the end of
                    the war, all the luggage was inspected as if it were the Customs before you went
                    onboard. And there was Frugal in the hatbox. Well the Customs Inspector knew my
                    husband well and so he enticed him into a long conversation, and this went on
                    and on and on. The bags didn't get looked at. But I thought, “How is Frugal
                    going to stand this?” And finally he said the bags would go on board. And I
                    said, “Oh this is my mother's precious china,” and grasped it with my arms and
                    went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>And because we were three, we had a cabin to ourselves. Other people were broken
                    up and the wives had to go in a cabin with other women and the men with other
                    men. And we had a tiny weenie little shower. And we popped the dog and my son
                    into my shower. And endless people came onboard to see us off, and we had drinks
                    coming in and out of the cabin. And we kept the door locked and opened it when
                    the steward brought the iced drinks. And finally we sailed. [laughs] And my
                    husband rang for the steward the steward said, “Si. We knew something funny was
                    going on in the cabin because you always had the door locked.” So then I took
                    the dog up and walked around on the upper deck and the next morning we sat in
                    our deck chairs and the deck chairs were lined three deep. And the dog sat
                    underneath the chair and people came around and said to me, “Well how did you
                    get the dog on board?” We just said, “What dog?” The captain came round and
                    greeted us and smiled and he never mentioned the dog. [laughs] And that was the
                    story of smuggling the dog!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of dog was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Scottie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scottie. You had Scotties in Kuala Lumpur didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. But not descendants of Frugal. [laughs] Well, then we served with
                    the military for two years, that was another mix-up. And also thousands of
                    amusing stories. And then went up to Rome in '47.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me some reminiscences of Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well it was an extremely interesting time because they were having the
                    first post-war elections. And I did say to you to look up that article in
                    Fortune didn't I?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I haven't done so yet, but I have it written down to
                        do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Because that really covered the whole set-up in the Embassy in great
                    detail and was very well done. And it mentions the names — it was meant to be a
                    correct story, not a fictional one. At the suggestion of the Embassy — it worked
                    — everybody, every in-law American in the United States, was urged to write all
                    their various relatives back in Italy and tell them not to vote communist. They
                    didn't care whether they voted socialist or liberal or... But just don't vote
                    communist.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>And I can remember one of the Italian workmen who we had around who was so
                    vividly disappointed because he had not gotten a letter from his relatives in
                    the U.S. And it was a matter of pride to people to have gotten these letters. So
                    I quickly wrote off to somebody I knew in the States and said write Mr.
                    So-and-So a letter.</p>
                <p>But it was a marvelous piece of coordinated effort and well worth it. Already the
                    Marshall Plan was in effect and grain was sent to Italy, and whenever the grain
                    ships arrived, the Ambassador went and greeted them, and this was an opportunity
                    to point out that this was grain coming in from the U.S. The U.S. is not
                    communist. Posters were put up. Well, as I say, it paid off. The communists did
                    not get a majority of... They've always had a very large vote in Italy. I think
                    less so now than almost at any time. But that was probably the most interesting
                    moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, just out of interest, did you spend a good deal
                        of time paying attention to what was going on in the election, or was it
                        something you just sort of knew about? You as a person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, that gets back to me. That's the sort of thing that happens to
                    interest me, so I would pay attention to it even if I hadn't been in the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So would I. It's meat and drink for me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: But obviously, per se, no American official went out and campaigned or
                    made a speech. All the things that were done were done, such as my writing to
                    someone to say, “Please write this man.” And we had Neapolitans working for us,
                    and we told them they all had to go back to Naples to vote. And they didn't seem
                    to see the seriousness of that. My husband absolutely insisted. And they all
                    went off together in the jeep and went down to Naples and did vote. It was an
                    effort to get people to go out and vote. They'd never voted before, it hadn't
                    meant anything to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the year of the election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It must have been the end of '47 or early '48. I've forgotten exactly.
                    It wasn't dead in the middle of the winter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can look it up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. The Allied Peace Treaty with Italy was signed early in '47 and the
                    elections, these were their first post-war elections... They had a republican
                    form of government already, but it had not been elected.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And by this time you had a son who was back in the United
                        States in school. Were you doing volunteer work in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well that was my point on one of these papers. I had offered through
                    some of the American priests...Well they had the Boys Town project, was very
                    active there, run by the — I'm going to say the American Jesuits and that may be
                    utterly wrong, but in any case it was a Roman Catholic project. And I offered to
                    teach English there, basic English to the students. But I have found in the
                    Catholic and Muslim countries that they really don't want — they're glad to have
                    the money, but they don't want persons who are not of their religious faith
                    having much influence with their children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can sympathize with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And I hadn't felt any great desire to do anything with elderly people,
                    so I don't know whether they would have accepted that or not, but I'm inclined
                    to think that... This was done more by the church organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Rome in the post-war period a very social city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well yes. You start off with the fact that Rome has two diplomatic
                    corps. They don't necessarily mingle, but there's nothing to stop them if they
                    wanted. But you have got two diplomatic corps because of the Vatican. And then
                    there's an old Roman aristocracy. A few of them were influential people. Most of
                    them were just charming and attractive. But there was only a layer of them at
                    any social function. As I say, a few of them were influential. Some of the large
                    landowners started improving their agricultural methods or started improving
                    their animal stocks. But no, they didn't... See, they were charming,
                    pleasant...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an out-everyday-for-lunch,
                        every-evening-for-something sort of place, or was it...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well again, we were at the top level so it tended to be out a good deal
                    for us. I was talking the other day with a younger wife who had been there in
                    Rome with us, and she named all sorts of people in the Foreign Office and the
                    Diplomatic Corps who I only recognized as names. So I think that pretty well
                    through the whole embassy, everybody was busy. There were just different groups
                    of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure that's true, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't think that it was a place where just the top was busy and the
                    bottom was bored. It would be very hard to be bored in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think so. You'd have to be the kind of person
                        who's bored every place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. We had a charming woman there who did fascinating lecture tours
                    and did them in great detail to small groups, and I belonged to that as did
                    several other wives. And you could go on — music, art, archaeology, everything.
                    But it was a relatively tranquil life. We lived down on the Via Appia Antica,
                    and I've been told since that it's absolutely impossible to live out there now
                    because of the traffic. It takes so long to get into town that people no longer
                    live out there. But at the time we lived out there, there were quite a few other
                    diplomats within a stone's throw of us and a number of people in the Foreign
                    Office. We rented the house from an Italian diplomat who was away at the time.
                    And it took about twenty, twenty-five minutes in. Beautiful drive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to find the house yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Oh yes. I've forgotten who gave us the lead or the tip, but... No we
                    had no housing agency as such that found houses. After that period — now I've
                    forgotten the background of where the funds came from, but they were called
                    “counterpart funds.” In any case, the U.S. government ended up with a whole lot
                    of lire for one reason or another [laughs] and, as a result, they bought what is
                    now the residence — I think they already owned the Embassy itself — I'm not sure
                    about that, but I know they bought the residence, and they bought a very nice
                    apartment building for senior officers.</p>
                <p>And they either bought or constructed at least two more apartment buildings — one
                    for junior officers, and one for single persons. So that there's less need if
                    any. I don't really know whether anyone takes their own house in Rome now or
                    not. It may be that they have to live in the government quarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was living in Rome difficult at that point, as Rome was
                        coming back from wartime devastation, or was it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I can't think of anything that... Well the telephones worked better in
                    Rome then than they do in Spain today. [laughter] And, of course, we did have
                    coupons for gasoline. I think the price of gasoline would have been prohibitive
                    — certainly living out in the country — if we hadn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was rationing coupons or diplomatic coupons that gave
                        you duty-free gas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Gave us duty-free gas. Tax-free gas. And whether there was a limit on
                    how much you had, I forget. I don't remember ever having any shortage or ever
                    thinking about it. We had two cars. And of course the Embassy imported the
                    liquor and the cigarettes as they always do. I can't think of anything that
                    there was a shortage of. Beautiful materials, beautiful clothes. Quantities of
                    food, good food. And of course Rome was never damaged during the war, so that
                    you didn't have the terrible slum areas that were left in Naples, which is where
                    we had lived from '45 to '47 when we were with the Army. It was an extremely
                    interesting, but nothing hair-raising or dramatic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I think that everywhere immediately after the war except for the
                    terribly damaged war areas — I'm not talking about [inaudible], I've heard... We
                    didn't have the terrorism of today. Italy has the Red Brigade. People are always
                    being kidnapped. That sort of disruptive aspect of life didn't exist. And once
                    the election was over and a firm government was in place...</p>
                <p>Well they had riots about things. [laughs] I remember one day — I can't remember
                    why I happened to be down at the Grand Hotel, but I was at noontime — and
                    rioting groups came up the street from the railroad station. I don't even
                    remember what they were protesting about. But it was the first time I had dealt
                    with the fact that the police sprayed them with hoses. They didn't use guns or
                    rubber bullets or... But the hoses all had paint in them, so when the rioters
                    dispersed off around the space, it was rather easy to pick them out because they
                    were sprayed with paint. [laughter] So the police didn't have to charge in and
                    break up the riot, the ward broke them up; and then in small groups, it was
                    possible to arrest them and take them away.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: I'd get paint, that was what was going to happen, I'd get paint.
                    [laughs] I don't know whether some of these rioters that we see on television
                    today — Palestine and Lebanon — whether they could be subdued with the hoses of
                    paint or not.</p>

                    of the Interior then and was thoroughly delightful. But those were people who
                    were not my intimate friends. I saw them socially, my husband saw them on a
                    working level. But they weren't contemporaries. We had many Italian Foreign
                    Office friends. As they were contemporaries, they didn't necessarily impress me.
                    I realize that they were brilliant or able, but...</p>

                        to... We all knew each other as very young people and we had a good time
                        together, but they've since gone on to be quite senior in the Malay
                        government. It's sort of in retrospect — oh yes, we knew them and it's kind
                        of hard to take them with quite the same sense of awe in consequence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It is. I don't know today, thinking around the world, off-hand, I don't
                    know anybody who is active in any government anywhere. In other words, my
                    contemporaries are gone.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Oh he hasn't been in years. The last time we were in KL was in about
                    '74, ten or fifteen years ago. And already he'd retired to Penang. Razak was
                    then Prime Minister and of course he's died.</p>

                        Madrid. Would you like to talk about that spell a little bit, or is it sort
                        of, except a different place, a continuation of the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, it's relatively a continuation with the difference of... We the
                    American government had a much closer relationship with the Italian government
                    than we had with the then Spanish government. At the time we were in Madrid was
                    the time our government signed the first base treaty and my husband did work on
                    that. And we were giving the Spaniards a good deal of military aid — in the
                    training sense rather than any other — as a quid pro quo for the bases. But we
                    were not... I'm trying to think how the government looked at it rather than how
                    I looked at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to hear how you looked at it to a degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, amongst other things... I think I'll start with the government
                    first. [laughs] We have had in this country for the last — well maybe one
                    hundred years — a very large Italian population. There's always been a strong
                    connection between Italy and the U.S. And I don't think we ever had at any time
                    that same sort of connection with Spain. Partially, of course, because of our
                    interference in Cuba and the Philippines and our assistance to South America to
                    liberate themselves from Spain. It didn't leave the same close feeling nor was
                    there a large Spanish immigration into this country.</p>
                <p>And then of course we move onto the fact that it was Franco and the Civil War.
                    And certainly our government disapproved of the Civil War, but our volunteers
                    almost all fought on the anti-Franco side. And then we move up a little bit.
                    Italy did try by her own efforts to make the armistice and come in on the other
                    side. Whereas, although Franco was very helpful about escaping POWs they were
                    considered definitely to be on the non-Allied side during the war.</p>
                <p>Well [laughs], going back to Nathaniel Hawthorne and all sorts of Americans who
                    lived in Rome in the '80's and 90's. There were all sorts of cultural ties that
                    we have with Italy. Except for “Tales from the Alhambra,” we don't have the same
                    or weren't taught in school the same ideas of Spanish culture that we have of
                    Roman-Italian culture. And all the people who had taken Latin and studied
                    Caesar's Gallic Wars. [laughter] I think probably even today more American
                    school children would be likely to have heard of Italy one way or another than
                    they would have Spain. Barring the Guatemalan immigrants.</p>
                <p>So that in some ways made the work harder and in other ways made it less
                    interesting. There were long hours at the Embassy, but it wasn't the... You
                    didn't have the same feeling that you were accomplishing something. At the time
                    of the fiasco Suez certainly the Embassy was able to play a helpful role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Spain at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: At that time. And it just so happened — nobody planned it that way
                    [laughs] — that we were up in Galicia with the Ambassador on a tour. And of
                    course Franco always summered in Galicia and so the Foreign Minister came right
                    up and foreign affairs were conducted in Galicia. And we were able to put over
                    the American point of view that this attempted seizing the Suez and marching
                    into Egypt was not a good idea. But off-hand, that's the only sort of crisis
                    that I can remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it more difficult to know Spanish people? I
                        know you spoke Spanish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: I don't think — I would probably have to say yes in the sense that the
                    Spanish people we knew were the “ones that one knew” in Madrid, in quotes,
                    whereas in Italy we had a great many friends that had nothing to do with the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was from the long family history with Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, also...Well, yes, certainly, partially due to that. But in Spain
                    — the people in Barcelona wouldn't like to hear this — Madrid was the center of
                    activities, and although the big financial institutions were often up in
                    Barcelona and the industrial magnates were in Bilbao, or the industries, the
                    coal mines, steel mills... And although we made many visits to both Bilbao and
                    Barcelona, they were always official visits.</p>
                <p>Whereas in Italy, we frequently went to places unofficially and just did meet the
                    people there, or we knew somebody who had a friend and said, “Oh, look up our
                    friend.” And the friend had nothing to do with government in any way. And that
                    was not true in Spain. We knew the people who lived in Madrid. They weren't all
                    in the government by any means. But they were all very definitely upper class
                    Spaniards. A few education people. But it was just definitely by their own
                    structure a more limited — had a more limited structure. There was not in Spain
                    any very large influential middle class. Off-hand, for instance, I don't
                    remember having ever known in Spain the owner of any large store such as, say
                    Woodward and Lothrop, whereas I did know people who did that sort of business in
                    Italy. I don't even know the names of who owned the large stores. But otherwise,
                    the general pattern of life was pretty much the same.</p>
                <p>[...]</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: We knew of our appointment [to Malaya] — oh, perhaps it was in June.
                    Well, I could tell before two absolutely delightful stories that took place in
                    Madrid. H.S. Lee and I've forgotten exactly who else now had gone to London to
                    sign the last papers of the transfer of power. And on their way back to Malaya —
                    why I can't imagine — they decided to stop over in Spain. Our opposite number in
                    the British Embassy, knowing nothing about the fact that we had been assigned to
                    Malaya, called us and asked, “Could you help me out? I suddenly have the Malay
                    delegation on my hands and there's no use asking any Spaniards because they
                    haven't any interest in Spain, and the Spanish Foreign Office isn't interested
                    in Malaya. And I've got to put together a luncheon for these people. Would you
                    come?”</p>
                <p>Well, we chuckled and thought to ourselves, “This couldn't be more fun. Here
                    we're meeting the Prime Minister and he doesn't know and we do.” So we trotted
                    off happily to lunch and had a delightful time. And about — oh it couldn't have
                    been more than a week later — the British Ambassador called up and said, “Homer,
                    I hate to impose upon you again, but I've got the Sultan of Kedah coming to stay
                    and what am I going to do with the Sultan of Kedah in Madrid?” (Well the Sultan
                    of Kedah then was the uncle of the future Prime Minister), and he [the British
                    Ambassador] said, “Would you mind coming to lunch?” So we said, “This really is
                    getting to be great fun!” [laughs]</p>
                <p>So that day we did go a bit early and Homer took the Ambassador aside and said,
                    “I'm not committed to any of this, but I think I should in all honesty tell you
                    that we are going to go to Malaya. And so we're delighted to be meeting these
                    Malays.” Well, coming back to Merdeka [independence], it had been decided at the
                    time of making the arrangements for the transfer that the British High
                    Commissioner would be the number one of the Diplomatic Corps forever instead of
                    changing as it does in most countries. And that the number two would always be
                    the Indonesian — that's because of the Malay ties with Indonesia — and that the
                    number three would be the Australian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the same sorts of reasons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: For the same sorts of reasons. So our government felt that there was
                    little point in our being in Malaya before Merdeka, simply vying with who was
                    going to be number five, whether it was us or the Canadians or the Germans or
                    what have you. And so they thought it would be more appropriate to simply wait
                    for four or five weeks before immediately recognizing the government. So we
                    didn't go until... So we came back here to Washington, and Dr. Ismael — we
                    always called him Doc — he was later Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes? Ismael was his only name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Only name. He was later at the UN and was going to be assigned as
                    ambassador in Washington. So we met him here in Washington. Had a very nice time
                    with him. But then when we were about — well actually had sailed and gotten as
                    far as Hong Kong, when the Malay government telephoned and said that they were
                    about to have the visit of some personage of importance, I can't remember now
                    who, and that they would prefer Homer postponing his arrival until after that
                    visit because there wouldn't be time for him to make his presentation calls
                    beforehand. They probably thought that it was not quite fitting that we should
                    be there during this function in a position where they couldn't invite us to the
                    function. So we delayed in Hong Kong about a week which was thoroughly
                    delightful. Didn't bother us at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about leaving Europe? I mean you had
                        up until then always been posted in Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, in my first interview, my first interest in this oral history
                    project was reading Hilda Lewis's story. Harry Lewis had been one of my early
                    beaus and had gone off to Singapore, so lurking in my thoughts of the Foreign
                    Service had always been the glamour of the Far East [laughs], so I thought this
                    was great fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say in retrospect that the Far East is
                        glamorous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: It certainly was for me. From Nepal to Borneo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you managed to see a good bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: We managed to see a great deal. We went over to Borneo and...</p>
                <p>I'd like to backtrack a long way. You said did I find the East glamorous. I'm
                    inclined to think you find glamour where you're looking for it. And it went back
                    again to the Service in the last years. Probably the young officer of today
                    cannot travel to a great many places that we could go to because of all of the
                    changing conditions. We certainly, in any country we were in, tried to see
                    everpossible inch of it that we possibly could. That takes me back to the Wali
                    of Swat. Swat is a little territory — well, in Pakistan, but rather like Sikkim
                    and his ruler would be in relation to India. And the Wali of Swat was a very
                    good friend of the Pakistani High Commissioner in KL where we lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shir Ali Khan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. They'd both been in Sandhurst together. So he said, “While you're
                    in Pakistan, you've got to go stay with my friend the Wali.” So it was all
                    arranged. And on our way back from Peshawar — and incidentally we were not
                    allowed to go into Afghanistan in those days, so we drove as far as the Khyber
                    Pass and down the other side and to the border gate and looked into Afghanistan
                    — and on the way back we deviated off the main highway to go to Swat. We were
                    greeted by tribesman border guards and escorted into a rather fortress-like
                    guest house. When I say “rather,” there were slits way up in the high cement
                    walls with a light. But it was thoroughly comfortable. The partitions of the
                    walls were slightly flimsy. And in the due course the court chamberlain came
                    down to see us and extended the invitation to dinner. And we were convinced he
                    came down to look us over and be sure whether we were safe as dinner guests or
                    not. I don't know that he'd ever heard of Americans before. But in the room next
                    to us we heard animated Italian chatter. And we thought of all places to find
                    Italians, up here in Swat. And in the due course the court car came for us. Oh,
                    before that, we had taken a drink, thinking that these were Muslims and there
                    wouldn't be anything to drink when we got to the dinner party.</p>
                <p>We arrived. And here were an entire group of men — I was the only woman. There
                    were several army officers, generals, and all the Italians, and it was a famous
                    archaeologist who was excavating in the area. We had a thoroughly hilarious
                    evening. The liquor flowed most freely, almost too much freely. [laughs] And
                    that was our visit with the Wali of Swat. The next thing, we were sent off in a
                    car to tour the insides of the mountain fortresses. And it was — well it was the
                    Himalayas. It was much more rugged than the Vale of Kashmir, but it was not
                    unlike being up in the mountains on the edge of Kashmir. It was not nearly as
                    fertile as Nepal, where Mt. Everest is.</p>
                <p>This [trip to Nepal] was not the same as the year of the Swat trip. It was a year
                    earlier. We had decided we'd go up to Nepal. Admittedly, even in those days, the
                    FS staff toocare and feeding of diplomats, and so we sent our passports over
                    into India and they arranged the flight tickets and so forth. So off we went.
                    And then we got to [Delhi]. Well, the airport escapes me now, but it's the place
                    where we had to change planes to go up to Nepal. And the Indian official
                    wouldn't let us on the plane because he said we had no visa to Nepal. The
                    Embassy had just overlooked getting it. So my husband argued with him and
                    pointed out that he, the Indian, had no right to stop us from leaving India.
                    That we were not being held in India for any crime, and the official agreed to
                    that, that we did have the right to leave India.</p>
                <p>So my husband said, “What happens to us in Nepal is none of your business.” And
                    the Indian admitted to that. So then we said, “All right, we'll go to Nepal.”
                    And the Indian said, “But I'm going to get into all sorts of trouble.”
                    [laughter] So my husband promised that when he got to Nepal he would get a visa
                    and when we got back a week later, he would show the visa to this Indian. And
                    off we went to Nepal.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>And we were met by an Embassy official and the car. And my husband said, “We have
                    to have a visa.” The man from the Embassy had a fit about this. He got us in and
                    got us to the hotel. And he said, “We're having a terrible problem.” The new
                    ambassador had only arrived several days ago and they couldn't get him presented
                    because the court soothsayer who cast the beans for what days were good days
                    couldn't find a good day. And so everything was being held up in a great
                    trouble. [laughter].</p>
                <p>So we went on to the hotel and were shown to our room. The hotel was an old royal
                    palace. It was a famous hotel. And the bar in it was run by a White Russian
                    named Boris. And everybody in that part of the world knew about Boris and his
                    bar in Nepal. We had a huge bedroom and a huge bathroom with a marble tub and
                    hot water and all was fine. And we went down to dinner. And fortunately we are
                    very fond of Indian food, so we enjoyed the dinner except that the waiter was
                    filthy dirty and had bright pink enameled fingernails. That was a little
                    off-putting. And went to bed.</p>
                <p>And during the night the rats had a polo game on the ceiling. And the ceiling was
                    a canvas tent, and as the rats ran back and forth like mad over this, the tent
                    swayed and went up and back. We thought the rats were coming through at any
                    moment. And it was quite impossible, the whole thing. So we said the next day we
                    wanted to have a room with a cement ceiling, no more canvas silk ceilings. The
                    man at the desk said that the only thing like that is the servant's quarters. We
                    said we didn't care, it had to have a cement ceiling.</p>
                <p>So we wandered out onto the roof up some little iron stairs into a room where it
                    did have a cement ceiling. And it was filled with flies. Incredible number of
                    flies. So I got out my spray can and sprayed. The flies really piled up
                    ankle-deep on the floor and the little boy who was carrying our bag was
                    horror-stuck and said, “Oh, but you may have killed my grandmother!” “Well did
                    you ever think that if your grandmother's been condemned to be a fly, you should
                    be very glad that she's been killed so that she can now move on into another
                    life. She may now be a bird.” “Oh,” he said, “I never thought of that. Thank
                    you. She's probably a bird.”</p>
                <p>So we went outside to leave and we met two other Americans living on that same
                    piece of the roof. And they said, “Oh, we see you've learned too about the
                    rats.” And they were stationed there with the AID mission. [laughter] And had
                    moved up for the same reason!</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Well [laughs], remember it was fairly primitive then! Yes, we went out
                    to the east coast one time with [inaudible] who was minister of...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Possibly. I...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well he came from the east coast and he was quite young and had a very
                    young wife and nice little children. And his wife had solid gold teeth. And he
                    wanted to go electioneering on the east coast. He was a prot�g� of Razak, and he
                    invited us to go with him. And we both thought this would be great fun, seeing
                    how they campaigned for election and visiting the coastal villages. You know
                    there were no roads in those days over on that side at all. And he had a small —
                    oh like a small yacht. It was a government, oh, buoy tender or something like
                    that. [...] Little Ismael.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And I think I probably said that he had this small yacht-type.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And at that time there were no roads throughout the east coast at all.
                    And I think we got on board in Rompin, I can't remember. But you probably
                    realized that the Malays have a terrible fear of the water. And so we went along
                    on this little boat and we were always looking out for sea serpents. We did see
                    a big sea snake. But in any case, we got to a small village, typical village,
                    about sundown. The sun of course all year around went down about seven.</p>
                <p>And they had a huge political rally and everybody spoke. And all that was fine.
                    We couldn't understand a bit of what was going on. There was noise and music and
                    lots of pollution. We had naturally assumed we were going to go back and sleep
                    on this little boat which had perfectly good if slightly cramped accommodations.
                    Not at all. We were led off to the phengulu's [head man's] hut. And the phengulu
                    had cleared out his bedroom. He and his wives all put mats down on the floor of
                    the other room. The house was on stilts over the river. And underneath it on the
                    river bank the goats grazed.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We were ushered into the bedroom, which was a very important thing to have. It
                    was the only house that had a bedroom. And the bed was boards and it had draped
                    over the top of it some purple hangings because the phengulu was connected with
                    one of the sultan's families. And that was it. Well, I always travel with my
                    pillow wherever I go, so I had a pillow. But poor Homer had nothing. So I took
                    the pillowcase off the pillow and stuffed the pillowcase with every bit of
                    underwear and clothing that we had and got a pillow for him. And we lay down on
                    the board.</p>
                <p>Well, the plumbing facilities consisted simply of a hole in the floor that went
                    down to the river. And I was a little afraid of even drinking the water that we
                    had. I think we may have had a bottle of soda water or something with us. In any
                    case, it was impossible to sleep. Absolutely impossible. The goats wiggling
                    around down underneath us, the hard boards. And I was afraid to spray the thatch
                    for the mosquitoes because I was afraid we'd drop all kinds of other bugs out of
                    the hatch.</p>
                <p>So at I guess 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, with the first rays of daylight, we
                    both got up and peeked out. And there was no way out except to go through the
                    room where the man was sleeping with his wives. And we were desperate. We had to
                    get out of that hut. [laughs] So we tiptoed very quietly out and headed down to
                    the water, the ocean, the Pacific Ocean. And went out and had a swim. We at
                    least felt a little cleaner, slightly, vaguely refreshed and eye-opened. And we
                    then wandered ourselves back to the little yacht.</p>
                <p>Well when our host discovered that we'd fled, there was consternation. We had of
                    course insulted the phengulu. We'd also insulted Ismael by not liking what he
                    directed for us. [laughs] And it was simply the most horrible, embarrassing and
                    unhappy morning.</p>
                <p>But we sailed away and we went to Tiamon, the island. And at this point, tired
                    and sleepy, I was at my worst. And I said, “I am absolutely not going to go and
                    sleep ashore under any circumstances. I don't care who is insulted in any way,
                    shape or form. I am not moving.” And as soon as we possibly could get off, “I'm
                    terribly sorry about all this, but we're going back to KL.” Well, Ismael was
                    frightfully upset and he said, “Well will you at least come to the rally and the
                    meal?” And I said, “Yes, of course.” And we went to that and that was fine. Sat
                    on the floor and had an excellent rice meal.</p>
                <p>Well he busied himself with where we were going to sleep. He absolutely would not
                    let us sleep on the boat for fear of the water. And he finally came back and
                    said, “Well I've arranged it. You can sleep in the hospital.” Well, the hospital
                    consisted of... At least it was a stone building. Again no sanitary facilities
                    in the building. [laughs] But it had a proper bed. And the bed did have cups
                    around the feet for the bugs. Then we went back to KL.</p>
                <p>So about a year later he asked if we'd come again and told me with great pride
                    and glee that this time he'd gotten a really big boat and we could sleep on it
                    and we did sleep on it. You asked if we went around Malaya. We went all sorts of
                    places all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as a consequence, got to meet people in a way that you
                        didn't in Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, I wouldn't agree with that. I think we met the same level of people
                    in Spain as we did in Malaya. In other words the officials, the villagers and
                    the townspeople. But the people we met out in the villages, exactly like the
                    same people in Spain, were not likely to come look us up in Madrid. They were
                    different in their customs and perhaps their education. But it was still
                    officialdom functioning. And at the time we were in Malaya, it was very
                    difficult to go off just by ourselves. We went up several times, drove ourselves
                    up to the Cameron Highlands. But we always had — we knew they were there, they
                    told us — we always had police watching us. And they asked Homer never to go
                    away from the hotel except to the golf course without telling them where he was
                    going. This was...</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Also, again in Malaya there was the problem of the language. I would
                    say 90 percent of the men in the government then, even in the regional
                    governments for lack of a better word, spoke English, but very few of their
                    wives did. And many of the sultans that we made the official calls on — their
                    wives did not speak English. The wife of the last sultan of Selangor spoke no
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I'm sure that's the case. When you first arrived, the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The overall emergency was lifted, I think, in 1960. It was
                        while we were there, I remember. Or the travel restrictions were lifted
                        enough that you could carry food in the car and some things like that that
                        initially you couldn't do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No, I remember that because we were going to go down to Fort Dixon one
                    time and take a picnic and go swimming. And we had not been told — this was
                    early on. I suppose it never occurred to anyone that we were likely to go off
                    picnicking. And when we got just outside KL, we were stopped. And in a perfectly
                    courteous way, the policeman asked if we had any food. We said yes, we were
                    taking a picnic. And again perfectly courteous he said, “I'm awfully sorry, but
                    you can't take food out.” I mean there was no harassment about it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: No. The road going over from KL to Rompin was supposed to go through
                    one black area. And also the road coming up from Singapore.</p>

                <p>BYINGTON: Well, I'll give you one funny story about K[laughs] Speaking of the
                    oddest things that have happened in each place, every time we gave a large party
                    — did I tell you this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well every time we gave a large party in KL we always blew out all the
                    lights and the whole electrical establishment. And the administrative officer
                    complained and complained about this. And they always came and switched them on
                    promptly and we always blew them out again. And I know a little about
                    electricity. So I knew what the problem was.</p>
                <p>And one day I got the local — he was a little Chinese electrician — over. I asked
                    him whether he had certain instruments. He said he did. I said to him, “Well
                    we're going to re-wire the fuse box.” And he just said, “Yes ma'am.” So we got
                    up on two stepladders and we did re-wire the fuse box. It's a question of A, B,
                    and C currents and I won't go into the technicalities, but in any case, the next
                    party we gave we didn't blow out the electricity and that was fine.</p>
                <p>And the Electric Board, somebody called me up the next morning and said, “Mrs.
                    Byington, you had a party last night and you didn't blow your fuses.” And I
                    said, “No, because I re-wired the fuse box.” And he said, “What did you say?”
                    And I said, “I re-wired the fuse box.” And he said, “Oh, I understand you. You
                    re-wired the fuse box.” And I said, “Yes, that's what I told you.” He said, “May
                    I come out and see you?” And I said, “Well, yes.” And so he walked in and he
                    said, “You did say to me you re-wired the fuse box?” I said, “Yes, how many
                    times do I have to tell you?” And he said, “Oh, what did you do?” So I told him
                    I balanced AB and I balanced CB and I balanced AC. And once it was in balance
                    they weren't going to blow anymore.</p>
                <p>He said, “Do you realize by doing that you blew out the three embassies down the
                    road, you blew out the power station?” [laughter] I said, “No, I didn't realize
                    it. I've been complaining to you for a long time about the fact that this was
                    not properly wired and it's your fault if you had it improperly wired all down
                    the rest of the way. It's working all right for me.” [laughter] They rapidly put
                    in the new proper electrical system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the way down the street! [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: An electrician would understand what I did. I sucked in more of certain
                    other ones to get mine balanced and therefore there wasn't enough of those down
                    the rest of the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that he was going to say to you that you
                        undertook the money that the little man makes...[laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: He could not believe that I technically was capable of doing what I
                    said I'd done. [laughter] He knew it had to have happened, somebody had to have
                    done it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that you yourself had done it! Is there any one thing
                        that you would like to sort of say in summing up, talking about your
                        experience in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>BYINGTON: I would just say it was all great fun from beginning to end. Naturally
                    it had its disagreeable moments, moments when I got furious. But those were few
                    and far between. I can remember them, but... It was royally... It was so much
                    more stimulating than anything that is happening to my grandchildren that are
                    here in the States. It was more... There were more things we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a sense of participation I think that I miss when
                        I'm at home. Even if one is participating in a very peripheral level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well I was trying to think of various friends of mine who married into
                    the civilian life here in the U.S. Perhaps one of the things was the fact that,
                    at least as far as I was concerned, I was much more wrapped up in the things
                    that my husband was doing. If I had married a doctor or a lawyer here, he would
                    have taken out somebody's tonsils or gotten somebody a divorce, but it wouldn't
                    have had any effect on me one way or another. Whereas the then life in the
                    Foreign Service, unless you were an absolute dumbbell, it would have been very
                    difficult not [to] have participated in the official life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Um-hum. And all the pleasures and so on that came with
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Yes. It wasn't a question of someone coming home in the evening and
                    saying, “Oh, I've had an awful day at the office. I'm so tired.” They might come
                    home and say that, but then you knew more or less what had been going on. They'd
                    been having trouble with visa frauds or whatever it might have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well thank you very much. I appreciate this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Would you expand on who they served under a little bit and how that made a
                    difference? I know what you're [going to] say, but I'd like to have what your
                    view of...</p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well I happened — I think I was more than fortunate. I only had one
                    dull “chiefess.” There was nothing bad or mean or anything like that. She just
                    was dull. All the other women whom I served under were stimulating. In different
                    ways, perhaps, but nevertheless people that it was interesting to be with. I do
                    know other people who have had less fortunate experiences, either with people
                    who were ill or themselves unhappy. In one or two cases, it's been some man's
                    mother which removes them another whole generation up the scale. And surely that
                    makes a difference to how they thought about their years in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly by the time I came along, people talked a
                        certain amount about “dragon ladies.” I guess that's a term that comes out
                        of... Actually, I know what it comes out of. It comes out of “Terry and the
                        Pirates” and so on. I guess what was meant was women who were martinets of
                        some sort or another. My own feeling has been that the myth of the “dragon
                        lady” was more potent than the real dragon ladies. That there were very few
                        of them and that part of it was a difference in generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well, that's what I was saying about a man who had his mother with him.
                    The man was already himself older than any given husband, or wives. And then he
                    has his mother instead of a wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she was setting the social...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well she was his hostess, she was... Yes, she served him as an
                    influence. I never happened — I know of two. I didn't have to serve under them
                    so it didn't affect me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just the stories went around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: And then of course you occasionally have a situation...Well, one case
                    was a man's sister who was living with him and acting as his hostess. He never
                    married. She just happened to be there at that time and had her own life. So
                    that she wasn't really terribly interested in the other wives. She had come to
                    be with her brother because it was going to be an interesting social life for
                    her, but what happened to the other women of the staff was really not her
                    concern. Well, then you have another third situation now today when you have a
                    woman ambassador. What do you do with the appendage who is husband?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what do you do with him and what doesn't get done in
                        the post because she doesn't have a wife? [laughs]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BYINGTON: Well in that connection, we went over to stay with Mrs. Luce one time.
                    We were in Madrid and she wanted to talk over something with Homer having to do
                    with the Embassy and so she asked him if he would come over and it was all
                    arranged. And everything couldn't have been pleasanter. And she was having
                    several Italian officials, politicians for dinner that night and they were going
                    to have their conference more or less with dinner and sit around afterwards.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>So Henry was there at the time. And Henry and I in little front parlor, and we
                    had drinks together and had a very nice dinner served to us. And of course he's
                    a very — well, was a very important and interesting person. But he and I had no
                    reason to be in that room together. I didn't know anything about his world
                    business. He hadn't the faintest idea who I was or why I was there. And so after
                    dinner we both looked at each other and said, “What are we doing here?” Said
                    “Goodnight” and went to bed.</p>
