                <p>RICHARD H. MELTON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 27, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>MELTON: I was born on August 8, 1935 in Rockville, Maryland. My father was from
                    Virginia and my mother was from Maryland. Both are deceased now. I grew up
                    mostly in the Washington area. I traveled some because after my father returned
                    from WWII and remained in the army, we lived briefly in Texas and Arkansas
                    before returning to the DC area. I finished high school here.</p>
                <p>I began college at the University of Maryland and after two years, transferred to
                    Cornell University, where I graduated in 1958. I majored in history and
                    government with a slight emphasis on history. My first acquaintance with the
                    Foreign Service came when I was a senior in high school. It was during “Career
                    Day”—or the equivalent—that a Foreign Service pamphlet came to my attention. I
                    had not given that possibility any thought before then. When I went to college,
                    I became very interested in foreign affairs and policy. In looking at various
                    possibilities, it seemed to me that the Foreign Service held the best
                    opportunity to pursue this interest. There may have been opportunities in the
                    private sector, but they were certainly not as extensive as they are today.</p>
                <p>There wasn't much of an opportunity to discuss the Foreign Service with anyone at
                    Cornell, except my wife-to-be who also was interested in foreign affairs. People
                    at the university were pretty much self-absorbed and not greatly concerned with
                    life outside the ivy walls.</p>
                <p>I had joined the ROTC while at Cornell—I had started that at Maryland where I
                    joined the Air Force program. The draft was very much alive; so most of my
                    friends had joined the Reserves or the ROTC. As graduation approached, I had had
                    three years of Air Force ROTC. I was in the pilot training program, but during
                    my participation in the program, the rules were changed requiring 5-1/2 years of
                    active duty for those entering pilot training. Since I was not interested in
                    making the Air Force my career, I switched to the Army ROTC during my senior
                    year which meant that I had to take all of the required Army basic courses in my
                    senior year—that was a burden. After graduation, in 1958 I was commissioned as a
                    second lieutenant and served until 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In the Army, I completed my basic training at Fort Bragg and then attended an
                    intelligence staff course at Fort Holabird, Maryland. After that, I was assigned
                    to the Pentagon and later to Fort Meade, Maryland. At Fort Meade, I was an
                    “Order of Battle” specialist, assessing the capability of various military
                    units. We spent most of our time in training situations, using documents from
                    WWII—which had very little relevance to then current matters. Toward the end of
                    my tour, my commanding officer sent me and a fellow officer to a friend of his
                    who was working in the Pentagon to see whether we could be used there. When we
                    went to his office, he showed us boxes and boxes of material that had never been
                    opened; he thought they were of little importance. We looked at them and found
                    that most of the material concerned Vietnam, which had not yet become a hot
                    domestic issue although we were already involved.</p>
                <p>When I was discharged in 1961, I had already passed the Foreign Service entrance
                    examination. So I took an interim job with the Library of Congress while waiting
                    for the Department of State to call me. While in the Army, I had taken some
                    graduate courses in history at Maryland University. That helped me in the job in
                    the Legislative Reference Service where I remained for several months.</p>
                <p>I joined the Service in the Summer of 1961, several months after President
                    Kennedy's inauguration. I remember going to the Inauguration Ball in the snow. I
                    was then almost 26, about average for my class. A number of my colleagues had
                    graduate degrees; others had just gotten out of college. Some had military
                    experience; a few were graduates of a service academy. I managed to stay in
                    touch with many during my career. A number left the Service before I did, but I
                    think the majority stayed until retirement. I don't think we had a single woman
                    in the class nor any African Americans.</p>
                <p>I think most of us were imbued with the Kennedy spirit which called for “service
                    to our country.” The campaign had been a rousing one; I had gone to one Kennedy
                    rally at the University of Maryland, even though I had not been politically
                    active. But I had a relative, an uncle, who was a long-time Democratic staffer
                    on the Hill. It was he who took us to the Inaugural Ball.</p>
                <p>During the A-100 course, we were asked about our area interests. My first choice
                    then—and that was true for the next 10-15 years—was to study Italian and be
                    assigned to Rome. I never got close! My first assignment was in Washington—as
                    was true for about 1/3 of my class—first to language training so that I could
                    attain the language proficiency required of all officers prior to full entry
                    into the competitive ranks.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My first regular assignment was in the Operations Center, which had just been set
                    up—one of Kennedy's innovations. In 1961, it was headed on paper by Ted
                    Achilles—a senior Foreign Service officer—but the key figure was Steve Smith,
                    the President's brother-in-law in his capacity as deputy to Achilles. When Smith
                    was present—and frequently he was not—we knew whose opinions counted most in the
                    Operations Center. Three junior officers were selected as watch officers; the
                    Center ran 24 hours a day, and the older FSOs didn't want to pull the night
                    shift; that left the three of us to take care of the night work on a rotating
                    basis. The other two were Herb Hoffman, since retired, and Gerry Studds—today a
                    Massachusetts Congressman.</p>
                <p>At the beginning, the Center was very rudimentary. Some people had been brought
                    in from the outside. The communications system was not nearly as elaborate as it
                    is today; in fact one of the first conclusions by the managers of the Center was
                    that the Department's communications system was atrocious. Luke Battle, who
                    followed Ted Achilles as head of the Center made a major effort to upgrade its
                    facilities. He briefed the Secretary, giving greatest emphasis to the state of
                    the communications systems. He thought that the people overseas were out of
                    touch and couldn't be reached rapidly in time of crisis and he was quite right.
                    Our ability to communicate with them was mediocre at best.</p>
                <p>But I found my tour very interesting because it was a period of great activity in
                    the foreign affairs field—e.g. the Cuban missile crisis. I remember the message
                    traffic and the concern it raised in my mind; it was clear to me that war was
                    quite possible and yet I couldn't say or do anything. I was very relieved when
                    the Soviets turned their ships around—very few people knew about that when it
                    happened. By the time of that crisis, I was the reports editor; I worked the
                    night shift and saw all the significant communications coming in during that
                    period. I would then prepare the morning summary for the Secretary. During the
                    missile crisis, we set up a task force and I was assigned to summarize the
                    significant messages from Latin America—reactions to the events and the
                    possibility of war and the efforts to line up diplomatic support in advance.</p>
                <p>During my tour in the Ops Center, the Berlin Wall went up. I was on duty when
                    some of the crucial decisions were made. Lucius Clay had gone to West Germany as
                    a special emissary. There was a very active debate on what US actions should be
                    and what the Soviet reaction might be. There was one school of thought that
                    urged us to just knock it down with tanks. Those with more cautious views
                    prevailed, with stalemate being the eventual result. I was privy to many of the
                    messages and communications within the U.S. Government on Berlin. The debate was
                    quite fierce and the options were mostly cataclysmic—no one knew what the Soviet
                    reactions might be and therefore once again there was a possibility of a major
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>Another major foreign policy issue that was debated while I was in the Ops Center
                    was what to do about the Congo. Frank Carlucci—who I would encounter later in my
                    career in Brazil and Portugal—was there at the time. There was a lot of
                    discussion about Tshombe and Katanga and people and places long forgotten.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>From time to time, some of the Department's principals would come to the Ops
                    Center to see this new beast. I served there for one year because it was a job
                    that physically was so taxing that one couldn't take much more than that. We
                    used to be on duty at times for 20 hours straight, taking short naps on a cot
                    that the Department provided. Essentially we worked on a four-days-on,
                    two-days-off basis, with the three junior officers taking their turn, but a year
                    was about all one could stand of that.</p>
                <p>After that year, my boss suggested that I apply for a “Congressional Fellowship”
                    even though I did not strictly meet the experience criteria. I was selected and
                    became the first Foreign Service officer to participate in this program
                    sponsored by American Political Science Association. Today that program is still
                    alive and has grown considerably. Many FSOs have participated. So for the next
                    year, I worked on the Hill.</p>
                <p>I spent the first six months working for a freshman Congressman from Maryland,
                    Carlton Sickles and the second six months for Senator Claiborne Pell. The first
                    job was quite interesting in part because I joined his staff before he even took
                    office. I went around with him helping to select office space and doing other
                    things just to get his office open and running. I knew something about Maryland
                    politics so that I fit in with the rest of the staff. I worked on education and
                    labor issues—subjects in which he had great interest having been a lawyer for
                    the AFL-CIO in Maryland. Sickles later ran for governor. Despite being the
                    initial favorite, he lost to George Mahoney in the Democratic primary—the
                    perennial candidate who always ran, never won, but spoiled for others. That gave
                    Spiro Agnew, the Republican candidate, an opening and he became the governor;
                    the rest is history.</p>
                <p>Pell had been a Foreign Service officer and at the time was a member of the
                    Education and Labor Committee. That was one of the reasons that I was anxious to
                    join his staff because he represented continuity on issues I had followed on the
                    House side for Sickles. Pell wanted to join the Foreign Relations Committee, but
                    had not made it yet. Eventually, after much lobbying, he was given a seat on
                    that Committee. Pell was of course interested in foreign affairs and had a
                    number of people on his staff who concentrated on that area as well.</p>
                <p>The Hill was an extremely valuable experience which would stand me in good stead
                    during my career. At the time, I looked at this assignment, perhaps naively, as
                    an investment in the individual, looking at the long-term benefits from a career
                    point of view. Most of the Executive Branch departments and agencies looked at
                    the program as an opportunity for an immediate payoff and therefore sent some of
                    their Congressional relations specialists—almost all being Civil Servants. I
                    thought that it was a mistake for the program to be used as a training ground
                    for lobbyists and later I argued against the Department following that pattern.
                    I thought that investment in people was much more important.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The program was excellent and, as I said, I used my experience in it in my
                    subsequent career. It helped for example in my work overseas with Congressional
                    Delegations (CODELs). I acquired an appreciation of the role of Congress during
                    my fellowship on the Hill, so that regardless of my standing in the embassy
                    pecking order at the time, I always welcomed CODELs. I viewed them as an
                    opportunity for a post to get its message across to some very influential
                    people. The members of Congress, away from the daily pressures, have time during
                    their travels to reflect on foreign affairs. It is an opportunity that the
                    Foreign Service needs to harvest more.</p>
                <p>In 1963, I was assigned to Managua, Nicaragua. I called one of my friends with
                    whom I had worked in the Ops Center to ask whether there were any other
                    possibilities. There were: Veracruz, Mexico or Managua. I didn't know where
                    either was; I knew that Veracruz was where the “Ship of Fools” went. I asked my
                    friend to read the post reports for both places; he told me that neither was
                    Paradise, but that Managua was an embassy and therefore was likely to have
                    possibilities for more interesting work. He recommended that I accept Managua
                    and I did.</p>
                <p>I remember coming to the Department from the Hill by cab with my friend. We were
                    talking about Managua and the cab driver began laughing and humming. He said he
                    had been there in the Air Force during World War II and painted a very grim
                    picture of Nicaragua, but by then it was too late—the assignment had been made.
                    I stayed in Managua from 1963 to 1965—two years.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to the Political Section of the Embassy as a labor officer. Toward
                    the end of my tour, I did some economic reporting as well, but during most of my
                    tour I did political reporting with emphasis on labor affairs.</p>
                <p>During the first part of my tour, Nicaragua was undergoing a small economic
                    boomlet, based on cotton and beef production. The political structure was
                    dominated by elites in the two major cities outside of Managua, Leon and
                    Granada—one Liberal, the other Conservative. The politics of the country tended
                    to be dominated by the traditional old families from those two cities. The
                    Somozas were super imposed on that traditional structure, although the old
                    families continued to set the pace for the country. There was only a small
                    middle class, leaving the majority of the people confined to the lower economic
                    strats which was predominantly agricultural. Most of the people lived along the
                    West Coast; the center of the country was sparsely populated and the East Coast
                    was the home of the Miskito Indians, but also sparsely populated. Nicaragua,
                    unlike Guatemala for example, did not have a large Indian presence.</p>

                <p>Nicaragua was going through a period of hope during my tour. Anastasio Somoza,
                    the old dictator, had died and had been succeeded by the more liberal son, Luis,
                    who was about to step down to be replaced by a close friend of the Somozas, Rene
                    Schick, a former judge. Schick, although handpicked by the Somozas, demonstrated
                    a welcome degree of independence,. The hope was that he would serve as a bridge
                    to a more open political system. That did not happen. The untimely deaths of
                    both Luis Somoza and Rene Schick led to Anastasio Jr, “Tachito,” assuming the
                    Presidency putting an end to the period of hope. But that did not happen until
                    after I had left. So during the 1963-65 period, there were indications that
                    Nicaragua was moving towards a more democratic system. So this was an
                    interesting period—a time of possibilities—in Nicaragua's political life.</p>
                <p>Somoza's National Guard was one of the principal barriers to this hoped-for
                    political transition. It was a single military force; it was never as large as
                    later reports suggested—probably in the 7,000 man range. That was not out of
                    line even with countries like Costa Rica which had no military force, but only
                    police. Later reports made the Guard seem much larger and all powerful. While in
                    Managua, I managed to do some English teaching at the binational center. The
                    students and I would frequently enter into discussions and the role of the
                    National Guard was a frequent topic. I was certainly not a defender of the
                    Guard, but I felt obliged to provide my students some factual material, such as
                    the size of the force and its relationship to the U.S.. It is then that I found
                    that the Guard's size was greatly overestimated by Nicaraguans and that there
                    was an unjustified aura about it.</p>
                <p>Most of my contacts were with the would-be-opposition; the Liberal and
                    Conservative parties—the traditional ones—were family run and split by internal
                    conflicts. The Liberal Party had become an instrument of the Somozas. The
                    opposition was largely ineffective, but among labor there were some members of
                    the Christian-democratic-social movement which was beginning to advance
                    throughout the continent. That movement was associated with the Church and its
                    hierarchy. It was showing some vibrancy in Nicaragua, particularly in the
                    non-Somoza labor movement. I got to know a lot of the members of this new
                    movement; most were quite young. Those contacts became quite useful when I
                    returned 25 years later for my second tour in Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>The Alliance for Progress was a new American effort to improve the standards of
                    living in Latin America. It was a Kennedy-inspired program. So we had large
                    assistance missions in many Latin American countries, including Nicaragua. The
                    problems in a place like Nicaragua was that its political system was a closed
                    one dominated by the Somozas. That made the management of a program like the
                    Alliance for Progress difficult because it had as one of its objectives the
                    propagation of a democratic political system. That of course was not welcomed in
                    a country like Nicaragua. Furthermore, all assistance tended to feed into the
                    Somoza system making it difficult to separate economic development assistance
                    from support of the Somoza regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>One of the problems we had was to satisfy one of our clients: the AFL-CIO. My own
                    analysis was shared by my boss, the Political Counselor: I thought that the
                    Christian-Democrats did represent a voice for democracy. They were also
                    dedicated to trade union principles. There was another strand in the Nicaraguan
                    labor movement which was much more politically oriented; that group supported
                    Somoza's Liberal Party and had the backing of the AFL-CIO because it viewed this
                    segment of Nicaraguan labor to be more aggressively anti-communist. Even though
                    I recognized the importance of the AFL-CIO position, I was at cross purposes
                    with American labor because I tended to believe that the Christian Democrats in
                    the Nicaraguan labor movement deserved at least equal access to US support
                    because it was far more active in its pursuit of a democratic political system
                    for Nicaragua. Fortunately, our USAID mission had a wise labor technical
                    assistance officer who was in charge of conducting training programs. He was an
                    old-line communications worker; we became good friends. We had a visit from an
                    AFL-CIO delegation which wanted me to be removed for being unsympathetic to the
                    AFL-CIO position in Nicaragua. My friend from U.S. labor movement gave me full
                    support and shielded me from the ire of his union colleagues. I found out from
                    the head of the delegation that it had come to Nicaragua prepared to award a
                    medal to Anastasio Somoza, Jr. I objected strenuously; I talked to the Political
                    Counselor who agreed with me that that would be a disaster for the U.S. image
                    and the course of democracy in Nicaragua, and we finally dissuaded the
                    delegation from this unwise course.</p>
                <p>We did manage to get the AFL-CIO to move a little, but not nearly enough. This
                    was the era of a very tough anti-communist line in the AFL-CIO. Eventually,
                    after my departure, the AFL-CIO came around grudgingly accepted the importance
                    of the Christian-Democratic movement.</p>
                <p>Aaron Brown was our Ambassador; he was a fine man. He had been the Department's
                    chief personnel officer. He was from New England and had all of the classic
                    virtues which we tend to associate with people from that region—straight,
                    honest, forthright. He told his people when they were right and when they were
                    wrong and supported you when necessary. A first rate ambassador. He supported
                    our position on dealing with the Christian Democrats, he was very frank about
                    the reality of the situation. I attended many meetings with him and Nicaraguan
                    leaders, particularly younger ones. He would always be asked why the U.S. could
                    not be more active in supporting efforts to replace the Somozas. His answer was
                    that Nicaragua was their country and they would have to do all the heavy
                    lifting; his advice was that since the Nicaraguans would have to live with the
                    results of any political change, they better give long thought to what actions
                    they might take. The U.S. would not take the heat for any political change which
                    might not be acceptable to Nicaraguans in general; they would have to take
                    responsibility for their own actions. That was a sound message.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>It should be noted that the Sandinistas were in existence in 1963. As a matter of
                    fact, the head of the movement, Carlos Fonseca Amador, was captured by the
                    National Guard while I was in Managua. The government held him for a while, but
                    then concluded that he and his followers were of no great significance and
                    released him—after beating and torturing him. He left unimpeded by the
                    government. The other locus of opposition was the Christian Democratic movement
                    that I discussed earlier. It was bolstered by the defection of some major
                    figures in the Conservative Party. Some oppositionists defected to the
                    Sandinistas and remained with them, but most like Mrs. Chamorro, split from the
                    Sandinistas later. But that is another story.</p>
                <p>Our policy toward Nicaragua was an aberration. Prior to Ambassador Brown's
                    arrival, we had allowed one political appointee and Somoza friend, Thomas
                    Whelan, to remain in place for ten years. US administration after administration
                    accepted Somoza as an immovable reality. The Bay of Pigs operation in part was
                    launched from Nicaragua—Puerto Cabezas on the east coast. So there was a bond
                    between the countries even though the question of what the U.S. should be doing
                    in the twilight of the Somoza regime was being discussed. As I said, the
                    Alliance had a strong bias toward building democracy and that gave us good
                    reason to consider a Nicaragua without Somoza. But as I said, in general, in a
                    country like Nicaragua, it was very difficult for an assistance program not to
                    support the existing regime. That was a problem.</p>
                <p>Nicaragua had at one time a thriving banana industry, but by 1963, there was no
                    major American firm like United Fruit or Standard Fruit which dominated the life
                    of the country as these mega-firms did in other Central American countries.
                    There were no large US investment in Nicaragua in the early 1960s. Cotton was a
                    major product because Nicaragua had the right soil and climate to make it a
                    fruitful producer. It was a relatively new crop for the country and American
                    firms had not managed to become the large land owners that they had in other
                    countries. So the U.S., particularly in light of the Alliance for Progress, had
                    a pretty good reputation in the rural areas where its programs managed to
                    achieve positive results—schools, public health facilities, etc.</p>
                <p>Somoza had a unique relationship to the U.S.. He was a graduate of West Point; he
                    had a lot of friends in the U.S. who gave him support—far more than any other
                    leader in Central America. It was quite clear to us that particularly Anastasio,
                    Jr. had access to privileged American information—i.e. Embassy reporting. We had
                    the feeling sometimes that he was actually reading our messages. Anastasio had a
                    fix on every officer in the Embassy—he soon segregated the staff into friend or
                    foe. It was quite clear that he did not include members of the Political
                    Section, myself included, in the “friend” category. I remember attending a
                    dinner given by the former Nicaragua Labor Minister, whom I considered a first
                    rate person, along with the Political Counselor. We were chatting when Somoza
                    came over to join us. He said, somewhat sarcastically: “Ah, my good friends from
                    the American Embassy...” although this was my first face-to-face encounter, it
                    was clear that he knew a lot about us and our views.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Even as a junior officer, we, as diplomats, had access to some privileged places.
                    We were readily accepted wherever we went. One of my children was born in
                    Nicaragua. The facilities were modest; this was a time when Managua had not yet
                    modernized, although in the pre-Nicaraguan days it was in some ways more varied
                    and attractive than it is now. Since I worked with labor unions, I probably had
                    more access to the average Nicaraguan than most of my colleagues. The
                    friendships I made were lasting ones and greatly helped in my return to
                    Nicaragua some 25 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings us to 1965. Were you still looking for that
                        assignment to Rome? How did you end up in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: I still put Rome at the top of my wish list that was to be submitted
                    every April 1—April Fool's Day. Of course the Department ignored this repeated
                    request. But my next assignment was interesting. I thought that I was going to
                    Canada—I had not yet done a tour in consular work as was expected of all junior
                    officers at the time. I thought that I was going to go to Ottawa to work in the
                    consular section there. My wife objected; Ottawa was too close to the U.S. and
                    to Cornell, where we had both attended university. As things turned out, we
                    didn't go to Ottawa because the Consul General wanted someone else—a nice young
                    lady that he knew.</p>
                <p>So after looking around, the Personnel Office found a slot for me in the
                    Dominican Republic. The Embassy was being turned over at the time following an
                    outbreak of violence and the landing of US forces under the authority of the
                    OAS, and I ended in Santo Domingo where I served from 1965 to 1967. I arrived
                    just as the fighting had ceased, but the political situation was still very
                    unstable.</p>
                <p>The Dominican Republic had also lived under dictatorship for many years. Like
                    General Somoza in Nicaragua, General Trujillo had been in charge from the 1930s,
                    until he was assassinated in 1961. He was followed by Joaquin Balaguer and Juan
                    Bosch, who was overthrown in 1963. In 1965, some Bosch adherents took up arms.
                    The regular military force had disintegrated and fragmented. At one point one of
                    the rebel leaders had come to the U.S. Embassy and offered to surrender in
                    exchange for certain considerations. The U.S. Ambassador, Tapley Bennett,
                    refused to get involved and suggested to the rebel leader, Caemono, that he turn
                    himself in to the authorities. That infuriated the rebel leader, who not only
                    did not surrender, but redoubled his armed efforts and virtually brought down
                    the government. Finally, under an OAS mandate, forces from the United States and
                    Brazil, plus token contingents from Nicaragua and Honduras, intervened and
                    stopped the bloodshed in Santo Domingo, where many thousands of people were at
                    risk.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>When I arrived, the Embassy staff had been almost completely changed. The
                    Department, quite wisely, had made the judgement that old staff was no longer
                    relevant and almost all were replaced. We were a new team charged with trying to
                    stabilize the situation. Peace was maintained by elements of the 82nd Airborne
                    Division and other foreign military forces that were still in place when I left
                    two years later. The American contingent did admirable work; they showed great
                    restraint in every respect, which was not true for all of the other troops. Our
                    soldiers conducted themselves very properly.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker was there representing the OAS-led multilateral
                    effort. Soon Ambassador Bennett was replaced by John Crimmins as chief of
                    mission. That was an unusual situation because Crimmins had been assigned as the
                    DCM. Frank Devine was then assigned as DCM. So we had a situation where we
                    seemed to have two DCMs—although we all knew that eventually Crimmins would
                    become the Ambassador. Despite some confusion for his handling of the situation,
                    Ambassador Bennett went to Portugal as our ambassador and then to NATO, as our
                    Permanent Representative, thanks in part to his good Georgia connections.
                    Crimmins, for his part, was a tremendously capable, energetic chief of mission;
                    he did a first rate job.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Santo Domingo as the commercial attach� although I had never
                    actually done much economic work. What I actually ended up doing was handling
                    the debt claims of Americans against a bankrupt Dominican government. I would
                    periodically go to the Dominican budget director and present a list of claims,
                    mostly from American firms who had not been paid for work they had done for the
                    government. The Dominicans quite rightly pointed out that many of the debts were
                    of questionable origin, but all took their place in the line for payment. One of
                    the large claimants was Felix Benitez Rexach, a US citizen of Puerto Rican
                    origin who had befriended Trujillo soon after his rise to power. He was rewarded
                    by becoming the major contractor for all public works in Santo Domingo. He built
                    the port and other major public facilities. Both he and Trujillo profited from
                    this arrangement. He had many holdings which the post-Trujillo regime
                    expropriated. So he asked the U.S. government to take up his claims; that
                    confronted us with a dilemma. Undoubtedly here was a US citizen who had
                    legitimate claims; the method by which these assets were originally acquired was
                    another matter.</p>
                <p>I had to deal with this. I listened to Mr. Rexach for hour after hour, day after
                    day, and, in fact, we struck up a good relationship. He would come in to see me
                    two or three times each week—along with his lawyer. He would leave the lawyer in
                    our waiting room and then regale me with stories about Trujillo and his gang. As
                    matters developed, Mr. Rexach became increasingly more interested in just
                    talking to me; he seldom actually pressed his claim or urged me to do so. He
                    just wanted to chat. The Ambassador was quite concerned about the potential the
                    claims case held for disrupting our assistance and reconstruction efforts in the
                    country. An expropriation finding could lead to a reaction long after I departed
                    the Dominican Republic. Under Trujillo the Dominican Republic had been granted a
                    large quota which allowed them to sell sugar to the United States at prices well
                    above the world price. Trujillo worked assiduously with key members of the U.S.
                    Congress to maintain the U.S. sugar quota.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The 1965 uprising eventually led to the victory of Joaquin Balaguer over Juan
                    Bosch in an OAS-supervised election. Balaguer ran the country for the next 30
                    years. A frail looking man, slight of stature, Balaguer was an amazing physical
                    specimen—only someone with exceptional stamina could carry on for all of this
                    time. During the Trujillo era, he was viewed as a secondary player and a
                    creature of the dictator. In fact, he turned out to be far more than that; he
                    provided continuity to the system, which without the presence of someone like
                    Balaguer, might have collapsed.</p>
                <p>Sugar has long been important in the Dominican Republic. The reason there wasn't
                    greater tension relating to the sugar trade was that American production is
                    primarily from beets, whereas the Dominican production came from cane. There was
                    a sort of splitting of the pie between the two producers. The sugar quota
                    covered only the cane grown product. As long as US beet growers were getting
                    their desired price, the import quota could be split among various cane growers;
                    with no economic impact on the U.S. producers. American growers did not show
                    much interest in that issue, leaving it to growers like the Dominicans to fight
                    over the quota. Trujillo was interested in getting the lion's share of that
                    quota. Since the American producers could not have competed in an open market
                    due to higher production costs and since the quota ensured a profit for some
                    sugar imports, all producers seemed to profit from the system—only the consumers
                    and the U.S. taxpayers suffered.</p>
                <p>This was my first experience with an embassy that was primarily staffed by
                    non-State Department people. The Foreign Service officers and staff were a
                    minority. We had a huge assistance mission; in addition to USAID, there were
                    many other US agencies represented in Santo Domingo. We had for example one of
                    the first FBI offices in the region.</p>
                <p>There was a definite Trujillo legacy even though he had been dead for several
                    years. One of the reasons why the instability had developed so rapidly and had
                    gone so far was the weak and corrupt political system and the inability of the
                    armed forces to intervene effectively to restore law and order. One small
                    disciplined group was able to influence the entire country. The armed forces,
                    although large, were undisciplined and had no will to fight.</p>
                <p>At the time of our military intervention in the Dominican Republic, there was a
                    hew and cry in the U.S. about our actions. Most of this happened before I
                    arrived in Santo Domingo. By then, I didn't hear much debate about the
                    appropriateness of the U.S. action. We were concerned about the proper role of
                    the U.S. in the post-invasion period and how we and the OAS might extract the
                    military force from the country without allowing the Dominican Republic to
                    retrogress to its dictatorial period. The test was whether in an election the
                    people would be permitted to make a fair choice. That objective became Ellsworth
                    Bunker's principal goal. The OAS maintained its own views; Bunker had many
                    non-Americans on his staff. I think that they did a good job in establishing the
                    proper environment for a democratic election and the transfer of power to the
                    winner.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There was some sentiment of skepticism, particularly among opposition groups,
                    about the presence of foreign military forces. They viewed intervention as
                    designed to block a return to power by the Bosch forces. We were accused of
                    seeing communists under every bed and of exaggerating the “red” threat;
                    therefore, the critics asserted, our intervention was counter-productive to
                    democratic development. We were viewed as defenders of the status quo. On the
                    other hand, what actually happened—the holding of free elections under OAS
                    monitoring—did establish our credibility with these groups—to the extent that
                    they would give any credibility to a US initiative. My view was that our policy
                    of trying to make our intervention a positive action was correct.</p>
                <p>Under Trujillo, of course, all of the people in power were part of a closed
                    political system. It was a corrupt system. But the corruption was highly
                    centralized and organized. If bribes were paid, it was all according to a well
                    established and understood system, as was their distribution. When Trujillo was
                    assassinated, the system began to disintegrate and corruption became anarchic.
                    Every official was on his own and had the freedom to squeeze as much as he or
                    she could. That made corruption much harder to deal with because it was
                    unpredictable; in a strange way, even those who had been corrupt began to feel
                    uncomfortable about the new chaotic process of bribery and pay-offs.</p>
                <p>I should note that as in Nicaragua a number of Dominican contacts showed up later
                    during my career—e.g. Balaguer, Juan Bosch. They lasted for a long time on the
                    Latin American scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1967, you were transferred to Recife, Brazil where
                        you served until 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: That is correct. Assignments at the time were for two years; later they
                    became three year tours. I was still relatively new to the Foreign Service and
                    relatively new to ARA; I had not established any contacts with the Washington
                    Latin American bureaucracy. I did not in 1967 believe that I had joined the ARA
                    club.</p>
                <p>By this time, I was quite comfortable speaking Spanish and by being assigned to
                    Brazil, I learned Portuguese as well. At the time, FSI had a branch in Rio which
                    allowed me to spend some time in that city—one of the benefits of being assigned
                    to a small consulate in Northern Brazil. I spent nine weeks in Rio de Janeiro
                    immersing myself in Portuguese, which came a little easier to me because of my
                    knowledge of Spanish. Nine weeks was shorter than most people spent in language
                    training. There are both a lot of differences and similarities between the two
                    languages. I didn't find it too difficult to move from one to the other, but
                    there were some in our small language class, who did not have Spanish and they
                    had a much harder time.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I must admit that I was initially disappointed with Rio; when we flew in the city
                    looked just like it does on postcards—beautiful amid spectacular geographic
                    surroundings. But on the ground, you run into some deficiencies. Services don't
                    work so well; the sewage and garbage collections leave much to be desired. The
                    city has been allowed to develop in a way that makes living for many quite
                    difficult. Tall buildings have been allowed to be built almost right on the
                    beach. Foot traffic does not flow very well. So I found Rio to be depressing at
                    the time; it was a dirty city.</p>
                <p>In 1964, there had been a change in governments in Brazil. The military had moved
                    in to block an alleged takeover of the government by the left. The U.S. had
                    become quite active in Brazil at about the same time with the launching of a
                    large Alliance for Progress program. The northeast of the country became a large
                    recipient of US assistance. At the same time, the Catholic Church was under
                    considerable pressure, primarily from a very liberal group of priests, to assume
                    a more active political role. The Peasant Leagues were founded under Francisco
                    Juliano and others, with the support of a number of priests. There were land
                    take-overs, accompanied by violence, followed by military repression. The
                    American diplomatic presence in Recife was quite modest and dwarfed by the USAID
                    staff of the Alliance. By the time I left in 1969, I was the senior State
                    Department officer in Recife, even though I was quite junior. When I arrived in
                    1967, the Consul General was a Foreign Service officer—Grant Hilliker; by the
                    time I left, due to the friction between the USAID and State staff, the CG was
                    Donor Lion—a USAID official. Lion was both the CG and the Director of the USAID
                    mission. The amalgamation of these two positions was an effort to resolve the
                    friction between the two bureaucracies, as well as the duality of policy advice
                    that had at times flowed from Recife. In fact, there were really no contest; all
                    of the resources belonged to USAID with almost 200 Americans connected with the
                    assistance program stationed in Recife and only three Americans who represented
                    the diplomatic side of our presence. The Alliance staff took its direction from
                    its Rio headquarters so that in the end, the CG had to fall into step.</p>
                <p>My first job was that of a political officer. I did reporting. There was a
                    Vice-Consul handling consular matters and the Consul General. In 1967, we
                    covered seven states in the northeast. By 1969, Recife covered nine northeast
                    states. Initially, we did not have responsibility for the Amazon region, but by
                    1969 we were responsible for that as well. We had had a consulate in Manaus, but
                    when it was closed, responsibility for the Amazon basin fell to Recife.</p>
                <p>The military government was quite tough and authoritarian. When I arrived,
                    Castelo Branco was in charge. He was succeeded by other military officers. There
                    was a real policy debate going on both in the Embassy and in Washington about
                    our stance toward this military dictatorship. The core issue was economic vs.
                    political development—an artificial dichotomy. One school felt that by providing
                    assistance and supporting economic growth, political development would be
                    forthcoming. That school felt that the U.S. should support virtually any
                    government that had a sound economic policy—even if that meant relegating
                    political growth to a secondary place on the U.S. agenda.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The other school felt that the U.S. policy could not accept development in one
                    area without comparable growth in the other. The U.S. should not support
                    policies in the name of economic growth which at the same time limited political
                    freedoms. So that was the debate within the U.S. establishment. The debate
                    tended to become personalized very quickly, at least within the Embassy. I
                    remember that we in Recife tended to focus on political development and our
                    reporting on repressive measures being taken in the northeast was well received
                    by some segments of the Embassy and not by others. In the Embassy, the Political
                    Counselor was Frank Carlucci who had been the Executive Assistant to Ambassador
                    Tuthill. He had been the energetic leader of “Operation Topsy” which called for
                    serious cutbacks in the U.S. presence in Brazil. The USAID mission and the
                    Economic Section tended to favor economic development as our primary objective
                    and dismissed substandard performance in the political area on the grounds that
                    once Brazil had developed economically, it would be more likely to follow a
                    democratic path.</p>
                <p>During Tuthill's era, the “balanced development” school tended to have the upper
                    hand. After his departure, the “economic development first” model appeared to
                    dominate the thinking of the Embassy and therefore the U.S. government. So in a
                    sense our reporting from Recife was somewhat out of step after Tuthill's
                    departure.</p>
                <p>In general, there are usually different perspectives between consulates and
                    embassies. For example, in one of my later assignments, I had a chance to see
                    the Brazilian consulates and the Embassy in Brasilia. Sao Paulo was a post right
                    in the middle of the industrial area of Brazil where economic development and
                    related policies are predominant. In that case, the best reporting on Brazilian
                    economic activity came from a consulate rather than from Brasilia.</p>
                <p>It was very difficult to cover this vast expanse of land of northeast Brazil from
                    Consulate General Recife. I did a lot of traveling—almost all of it by air
                    because of the distances. I would try to cover two or three states on each trip.
                    In each capital, I would start with the contacts that I had developed and then
                    try to broaden my list. I would spend several days in each capital. I would try
                    to bring myself up to date on the issues we were interested in and then write my
                    reports when I returned to Recife. I would try to arrange some appointments by
                    phone or through the mails. When I arrived at a location, I would arrange for
                    other contacts, but I usually had some initial calls arranged ahead of time.
                    Those calls were the foundation of a visit program. For example, Fortaleza, the
                    state capital in Ceara, was an important area because it had a banking
                    institution—the Bank of the Northeast. There were some other groups of interest
                    there—progressive Catholic churchmen, some political activists. We focused on
                    areas of concern to the US, in addition to the local politics which might have
                    been of interest in the state, but not necessarily of national importance or of
                    immediate interest to us. We looked for issues with national implications. We
                    would follow local issues and tried to be informed about them, but those were
                    not of great interest to the Embassy or Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>We reported on national political and economic issues, such as developments
                    effecting the Church, which had a political role as well as a spiritual one. It
                    was going through a period of internal debate, as part of the global discussion
                    which was then ongoing. The Catholic Church was an important factor in Brazil.
                    There were some 245 bishops in Brazil at the time; I doubt that there were
                    one-third as many in the US. The Church was a power, both in Brazil and
                    globally. The bishops took stances on social issues, which had political
                    implications; therefore their views were of interest to us. So I maintained
                    contacts with all of the leading churchmen in the Northeast and made a point of
                    meeting with the bishop in every state that I visited. All of the major states
                    had at least one bishop. Several of them were very influential nationally. Dom
                    Helder Camera was the bishop in Olinda, right across the river from Recife. Jose
                    Maria Pires, at the time Brazil's only Black bishop, was in nearby Joao Pessoa;
                    he was an influential leftist churchman. There were several conservative bishops
                    in other northeast states; the President of the National Council of Bishops was
                    in Teresina, a small town in the interior of the state of Fortaleza—I don't know
                    if any American diplomat had ever been there. I did. I made a point of going to
                    places where there was someone of interest to the United States.</p>
                <p>We also had an economic officer in the Consulate; sometimes we traveled together
                    and talked to the same people, attempting to meld political and economic
                    perspectives. At other times, we went our separate ways. If I traveled alone, I
                    might also cover economic issues and talk to people on those matters.</p>
                <p>As I said, when I made these visits I would prearrange a certain number of calls.
                    When I got to the city I would add other people, sometimes at the suggestion of
                    one of my original contacts. They might sometimes help me make those additional
                    appointments. I would always try to call on the local authorities in each state.
                    That is important in a country like Brazil; a diplomatic representative is
                    expected to follow local custom, which includes calls on local authorities. If
                    one doesn't, that could quickly lead to problems. I would call on the military
                    commanders everywhere as well as the police commanders, if they were different
                    than the military ones. I would call on church officials, on governors, on
                    mayors—it should be noted that by this time, the military had intervened in all
                    of the states. So governors, mayors, and other local officials were all
                    appointed by the military. In some cases the appointees had been very popular
                    and had a base of support of their own. Many people, it should be remembered,
                    supported the military take over in 1964; that was particularly true in the
                    Northeast. So there was not a uniform revulsion about military government; on
                    the contrary, many Brazilians welcomed the take over and supported the new
                    regime both at the state and national levels. So the local political leadership
                    was a mixed bag.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I should also mention the students, who at this time, were becoming active. I
                    maintained contacts with them as well. It was the policy of the Kennedy
                    administration to show interest in youth worldwide. That continued into the
                    Johnson administration. We had someone in the Embassy—a USIA officer—who was
                    designated as the youth officer. He was younger than I, and had a mixed effect.
                    He also maintained contacts with students. The people I knew were much more
                    interesting and tended to be much more attuned to our concerns.</p>
                <p>I also kept in touch with labor leaders. In the Northeast, we had, as I
                    mentioned, the Peasant Leagues, which were a rural labor movement. The Church
                    gave it support through its worker-priests who acted as organizers in rural
                    areas. The two best known were Father Paulo Crespo and Antonio Mello, both of
                    whom operated just outside of Recife in Pernambuco state. I got to know both of
                    them quite well. Both were highly activist, one tended to be a little more
                    conservative and orthodox than the other, but both were very effective and
                    therefore much disliked by the military authorities.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Brazil with the view that US policy was properly disposed to support
                    democratic governments. I arrived with some skepticism about military rule,
                    which was consistent with U.S. policy. Therefore, we supported opening of the
                    political process and strengthening of political institutions. In Nicaragua, I
                    had not seen notable progress in similar efforts, but it was clear to me that
                    Ambassador Brown's policy was correct—that is we were as supportive of
                    liberalization as circumstances permitted, but the ultimate responsibility
                    resided with the Nicaraguans. As for the Dominican Republic, I arrived after the
                    die had been cast. Following the intervention, I think our policy was quite
                    clear; we were trying to promote democratic elections and efforts toward
                    political liberalization. Both countries had been ruled for a long time by
                    military dictatorships. So I was accustomed to military dictatorships. Brazil
                    had had a democratic election which had been overturned by the military in
                    1964—largely because of economic failures. It was clear that the country had a
                    strong democratic predilection which were trying to strengthen.</p>
                <p>The debate within the mission was on how to give support to these Brazilian
                    democratic tendencies. Was economic development a necessary precursor to
                    political development? It was the classic debate. I think in the Northeast we
                    saw signs of the heavy hand of the government although there were some
                    encouraging indicators, such as the military's interest in economic development.
                    The government was devoting considerable resources to development of the region;
                    it had a lot of novel schemes, such as redistributing resources from other parts
                    of the country into the Northeast. As we gained experience we learned that some
                    things work and others don't. The government's role was actually much more
                    limited than anticipated; concern that the government would be too deeply
                    involved in economic development was, in the main, not justified. The
                    government's impact was much limited than the government would acknowledge at
                    the time and that was shown by later studies.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Of course, the military defended its role by suggesting that we Americans just
                    didn't understand Brazilian culture and habits. We got that line from many
                    sources—mostly on the right. There was a doctrine in existence at the time that
                    the Southern cone was fighting the world's battle against the “Godless
                    atheists”—i.e. the communists. They were taking up the cause that we Americans
                    didn't have the guts or the heart to do; according to this view, the Latin
                    American military were really fighting our war and that we were naive in our
                    approach to communism. We certainly heard that message many times from the
                    military.</p>
                <p>For example, one of the responsibilities of a diplomatic establishment is the
                    protection of its citizens. In Northeast Brazil, there were a number of American
                    priests and nuns, brought to Brazil by the Church which customarily sends
                    foreigners to countries which suffer from shortages in religious vocations. A
                    number of these American clergy were socially engaged; that brought them into
                    conflict with the military, which emphasized order and viewed such social
                    activism as disruptive. As I mentioned earlier, we maintained contact with the
                    Church; it was in 1968-69 when we were told that two American priests had just
                    disappeared in Recife. No one seemed to know where they were; people were
                    frightened by this development. We made inquiries and discovered that the two
                    were actually being held by the Recife police. We let the authorities know that
                    we were looking for these two American citizens and that we understood that they
                    might be in their custody. The police reluctantly acknowledged that indeed the
                    priests were under arrest. Reluctantly also we were finally granted access to
                    them, as indeed was our right under various treaties. The Consul General and I
                    went to see the priests; then we went to see the 4th Army commander—a very
                    senior four star general. With him, we had a variation of the conversation I
                    described earlier; “You Americans don't understand how to combat the evil of
                    communism.” Of course our reply was that it was he, the general, who did not
                    understand how to fight communism. That conversation did not go very far in
                    getting the priests released. But our intervention and subsequent daily visits
                    made it clear to the government that the U.S. was interested in the fate of the
                    two priests and therefore provided a degree of protection to them.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the Brazilian military hardened its position. They decided to charge
                    them under sedition laws, which would have called for a trial by a military
                    court. The penalty would have been thirty years in prison. They gave the priests
                    the choice of voluntary departure or a military trial—where the decision was
                    preordained. That choice created a crisis of conscience for the priests. Their
                    superiors from St. Louis had arrived by that time, and the dialogue about their
                    future had been raised to higher levels in Brasilia and Washington. Eventually,
                    the priests did leave; in our protection capacity, I went to the airport to see
                    them off. It was an emotional scene with all their “brothers” at the airport. I
                    think this particular episode did help us in establishing some credibility with
                    both the Church and ironically, the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The new CG, a USAID officer, was Donor Lion. He was an interesting person. He is
                    now retired. He and I saw the situation in the same way. From his background in
                    development economics, he understood that political and economic growth go hand
                    in hand. Title IX of the Foreign Assistance Act had just been passed; it placed
                    heavy emphasis on the desirability of political development, so that USAID
                    missions were directed to include that goal as part of their programs. Donor
                    Lion took this directive very seriously; that fitted well with my approach to
                    political reporting which was closely linked to our economic development
                    programs—education, public health, etc—which had a heavy social content. The
                    Consul General saw the two main strains of development—political and economic—as
                    closely linked. We got along well.</p>
                <p>Lion's approach was not always appreciated by his superiors in Rio, both in the
                    Embassy and the USAID mission. They were not very comfortable with the linkages.
                    We were stressing. We were viewed as “renegades.” But we were not deterred, and
                    my reporting emphasized the same issues as it always had. Our reporting would
                    generally go to Rio first which would usually send it to Washington with the
                    Embassy's comments attached. In some instances Brasilia and Recife agreed to
                    disagree, which was fine.</p>
                <p>I might just add a comment or two on our assistance programs in Northeast Brazil
                    at this time. They did achieve some results—e.g. if the project was to build
                    schools, they were built. Progress was less measurable when dealing with more
                    amorphous endeavors such as “improving education” through text book reforms.
                    Measuring impact on educational reform is much harder than dealing with bricks
                    and mortar. The same could be said for the public health field which had
                    projects in family planning for example. I think that we made a clear impact,
                    but how it is measured is much more difficult.</p>
                <p>Our assistance mission consisted at the time of almost 200 Americans. It was a
                    substantial program. I think we may have overvalued the potential benefits of an
                    American presence on economic development, but this was a heady period in our
                    history when we believed that we could do almost everything, given good will and
                    adequate resources. I think we perhaps over-reached.</p>
                <p>I did attend some Embassy meetings, but my trips to Rio, where the Embassy was
                    still located, were infrequent. When I did visit the Embassy, I would of course
                    talk to anyone interested in our work. I was still a relatively junior officer,
                    but a pretty active one. I think the Embassy took my views seriously, although
                    perhaps having a “Northeast” perspective, which was not necessarily
                    representative of the whole country.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Our military attach�s had traditionally been very close to the Brazilian military
                    dating from our alliance of WWII during which Brazilian troops had fought
                    alongside American units in Italy. Vernon Walters got his start being a liaison
                    officer to the Brazilian forces. He was an attach� in Brazil subsequently. He
                    was succeeded by Art Mora, who was able to maintain the same levels of access
                    that Walters had developed. Art was the senior attach� when I was in Brazil. He
                    was very sympathetic to the Brazilian military. I think it is fair to say that
                    our military attach�s, the aid mission and the Economic Section were more
                    forgiving of the Brazilian military regime on the grounds that economic
                    development was essential in that country and had to precede any political
                    opening. So they provided sympathetic understanding and were more pro-regime
                    than those of us in Recife.</p>
                <p>A lot of work has been done on looking at the social origins of the Brazilian
                    military. The Brazilian elites traditionally have considered a military career
                    for their male off-springs—not their daughters—to be a worthwhile goal. Over the
                    years, a tradition of service grew up with sons of military officers following
                    in their fathers' footsteps. The military set up its own secondary school system
                    which was the path to the military academy. I don't think one can say that a
                    military caste was being developed, but the officer corps was gradually becoming
                    more insulated. It tended to be drawn from the southern part of Brazil—that was
                    very noticeable in the Navy—but I think all services drew heavily on the South
                    for its officer candidates. There were of course noticeable exceptions—some
                    military leaders came from the Northeast—but by and large they were
                    southern.</p>
                <p>If you look at the disposition of the Army, it is notable even today that most of
                    the units will be located on the Argentinian and Uruguayan borders. That has
                    been traditional. That reflects the historical concern of the Brazilian
                    military—a perceived threat from Argentina. Recently, the two countries have
                    made some progress in reducing this rivalry, but there is still a troublesome
                    legacy of more than 100 years. The disposition of forces has reflected that
                    concern.</p>
                <p>The other foreign concerns tend to be secondary to the Argentinian rivalry. The
                    Brazilians have periodically shown concern for other neighbors, but not with the
                    intensity and persistence of the concern with Argentina. In the North, the
                    terrain is such to provide a natural defensive barrier; the concern in that
                    region revolved around sovereignty and the demarcation of borders. There are
                    cross-border interlopers, but this is not a major threat. The Brazilian military
                    presence in the North is intended to assure that Brazil's claims to territory
                    are made good. The military is deployed throughout sparsely populated areas to
                    defend these claims.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I must say that I have learned much more about Brazilian economic development
                    after my tour than I knew while I was there initially. I think we need to
                    remember that there are several Brazils. The farther south one goes, the more
                    advanced and sophisticated and productive the economy is. Some states in the
                    south are actually nation-size in the European sense. If they were independent
                    nations, they would have the economic and social indices of a European
                    country—or very nearly so—in most respects. Their per capita income is quite
                    respectable; the literacy rate and life expectancy would be almost at a European
                    level.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Northeast had indices that placed in the Third World. So
                    there are several Brazils. We knew it then—and that is still true today—as a
                    country which had major disparity of incomes—great wealth and great poverty. But
                    Brazil, unlike many other countries, is so large that it achieves critical mass
                    in almost every field. So with the wide disparities, Brazil can still
                    manufacture world class products in virtually all areas; it does educate enough
                    of its people sufficiently to be able to compete in the world markets even when
                    hampered by the great differences in economic development among its various
                    regions. And that is still true today.</p>
                <p>These disparities did not engender the unity of the states, Brazil has a
                    federated system, similar to the US, except that the states are much more
                    autonomous than are ours. A Brazilian state has great control of its social and
                    economic affairs. This is a reflection of a separatist tendency; Brazil has
                    suffered through several insurrections as well as a civil war which brought
                    Getulio Vargas to power in 1930; that was a war to prevent the south from
                    seceding. By the time I served in Brazil, the separatist movement was pretty
                    much in abeyance, although glimmers of such sentiments were still evident in the
                    Northeast and in the South. The military was always worried about keeping the
                    country together. The motto of the Brazilian Army emphasized the need for
                    holding the country together; it was a central mission of the Army throughout
                    its history, particularly after the 1930 civil war. It had put down separatist
                    movements in the Northeast previously, but the potential of such movements was
                    never far from the military's consciousness. That was one of the reasons for its
                    concern about the activities of the Peasant Leagues which they believed might
                    have moved in that direction.</p>
                <p>Inflation at the time was being subdued. The military had excused its 1964
                    take-over by the need to tame run away inflation; so when inflation abated
                    somewhat, the military could point to some success for their tight control of
                    the economy and the political life of Brazil. But inflation, until recently at
                    least, has been an albatross around the economy's neck; it was never really
                    tamed until recently. It must be understood that inflation can be a plus for
                    some segments of society because it in effect wipes out debt. Inflation, in
                    theory at least, is a great leveler. In practice, it hurts those least able to
                    support pain—the poor. Brazil managed to work out a modus vivendi with
                    inflation. It indexed virtually all transactions, so that even with accelerating
                    inflation, there is relative stability in the marketplace. Some economists
                    thought that Brazil had found a way to coexist with inflation, but later events
                    indicated that this was not quite true. Inflation, even with indexation, still
                    inflicts penalties on the economy and predictability exacts a very heavy
                    expense.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Environmental concerns were very much in the background during my tour in Recife.
                    The Amazon and its rich natural resources were not part of our consular district
                    until almost at the end of the tour when Manaus was added to our district, but I
                    don't remember any great concern at the time about environmental damage.</p>
                <p>Recife was a large city with almost a million people in its metropolitan area.
                    But it had the atmosphere of a small town. The Northeast tends to be very family
                    oriented; people are very slow in accepting newcomers—in contrast to the
                    openness that is the hallmark of Brazil. So we had some difficulties in making
                    lasting friendships; it was done, but it was difficult in light of the social
                    environment, which had very pronounced social positions and divisions. As
                    diplomats we are usually ranked very high on the social ladder; that gave us
                    good entre into official circles, but that did not easily translate into social
                    access. We did belong to various clubs, but that did not necessarily translate
                    into social access within the local community. But I need to say again that
                    Brazilians in general—including those in the Northeast to some degree—are very
                    open; a minimal effort by a foreigner will usually open doors.</p>
                <p>My social activities in any case had to be circumscribed because we had small
                    children at the time. Fortunately, in Recife at the time, parties or other
                    social events tended to be over fairly early in the evening—that is not true
                    today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Brazil in 1969 and went to the University of
                        Wisconsin. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: By 1969, I had been in the Service for ten years, most of the time in
                    Latin America. I strongly believed that it was time to do something else. I
                    looked around; I applied for University training. That turned out to be area
                    studies. I got a Master's Degree at the University of Wisconsin in Latin
                    American studies in 1971. I must say that I resisted entering this program to
                    some extent believing that area concentration might end up restricting rather
                    than broadening career prospects. In fact, I spent most of my time taking
                    courses in political science and economics.</p>
                <p>These were exciting times in Madison. The University of Wisconsin had a well
                    deserved reputation for being a very liberal institution. The students were up
                    in arms about Vietnam. The campus was quite lively. The atmosphere was one of
                    definite skepticism and suspicion of the U.S. government and its policies; in
                    some cases, there was outright hostility to people who may have had a connection
                    with the government—people like myself were particularly suspect because we had
                    a relationship with the foreign policy apparatus of the government. If we were
                    not the enemy itself, we were certainly viewed by some as the unwitting pawns of
                    the enemy.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Classes were often disrupted. That was a unique experience. I had attended what I
                    considered a first rate academic institution—Cornell University—where the
                    intellectual environment was stimulating and highly competitive. That was what I
                    was accustomed to and what I expected to encounter in Madison. But instead I
                    observed a sharp deterioration of the academic environment as professors were
                    routinely shouted down and not allowed to teach. In some cases, the professors
                    showed no disposition to teach; the faculty and the institution were bending
                    under the pressures of the day—to put it diplomatically. The academic standards
                    and the other attributes of a great university were seriously diminished. If I
                    got past the initial skepticism generated by being a State Department employee,
                    I was still regarded as part of the establishment that some were trying to bring
                    down. If I could be seen as an individual instead of a caricature of a
                    bureaucrat, then the atmosphere was more cordial—sometimes I even managed to get
                    to a discussion of the issues.</p>
                <p>I was in a graduate program together with a small group of students. Eventually,
                    I think I got that group at least to get over its initial prejudices. So I
                    didn't have any problems in the graduate classes I attended. However, in survey
                    courses, or in larger campus activities where I was viewed as a representative
                    of the government and not as an individual, then the reaction was more hostile.
                    It was during my year at Madison that the math building was partially destroyed
                    by a bomb with one person killed and several injured. Fortunately, it occurred
                    in the middle of the night; otherwise the casualties might have been far
                    greater.</p>
                <p>During the height of the disturbances, my seminars were routinely held at private
                    homes to avoid the campus disruptions; the alternative often was not to hold
                    class at all. The whole atmosphere was depressing; it was not a democratic
                    environment. Ideas were not discussed; the day belonged to those who could shout
                    the loudest. The authorities were not acting responsibly. If Madison had been
                    representative of the whole American society, I would not have been very
                    optimistic about the future. Fortunately, Madison was not the world. The 1960s
                    and early 1970s passed and institutions survived. The system may have given a
                    bit but did not break. It was never in serious danger. But the 1970-71 period
                    was not conducive to education. I managed to learn a lot at Wisconsin, but much
                    of it was extracurricular.</p>
                <p>One of the explanations for the abdication of faculty responsibility was that
                    many universities were undergoing a major internal reorganization—apart from the
                    political issues. There was considerable debate about the number of professors
                    needed to accomplish the university's goals. For example, one of my professors
                    at Wisconsin, Thomas Skidmore—a preeminent expert on Brazil—had begun as a
                    student of Russian studies at Harvard. He was told just as he was about to earn
                    his Ph.D. that he had made a big mistake; he would have to change his specialty
                    if he wanted an academic career because there was a huge surplus of Russian
                    experts. If he stayed in that field he was not likely to obtain tenure, even if
                    he were fortunate enough to find a job. So he switched to Brazilian studies.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>There were other cases such as those of Skidmore; people who had graduated from
                    good academic programs; they had been hired as junior faculty members, but their
                    prospects for tenure and a career were not very good. So part of the campus
                    unrest had to do with the career concerns of the junior faculty. The senior
                    faculty were unsure of their future for different reasons; the campus unrest was
                    directed at established institutions, of which they were the controlling group.
                    They therefore tended to bend to the pressures to preserve their position. So
                    both the bottom and the top of the academic ladder were in a period of great
                    uncertainty. Whatever the reason, I didn't find much courage in the faculty or
                    administration at Wisconsin. The people responsible for the management of the
                    institution did not try to maintain an academic atmosphere on the campus; they
                    did not stand up and fight disruptive elements. More often, the institution's
                    leadership was looking for ways to accommodate the rebels; it was looking for
                    ways to be more “inclusive.” That was a good objective, but while ways were
                    sought to pacify the students, reprehensible deeds were taking place which
                    should not have been tolerated—but they were. The leadership has to live with
                    the consequences of its inaction or accommodation. The student leaders on the
                    other hand were very committed to the cause of the moment; time took care of
                    most of the issues, and they became committed to other causes and many became
                    quite successful in their after-student life. I think that much of their
                    commitment at the time was misplaced.</p>
                <p>The other factor that made Wisconsin the center of student anti-government rage
                    was the University's deserved reputation for excellence in a number of fields.
                    Much like Cornell, it was a combination of a state schools and private
                    institutions which drew a considerable part of its student body from out of
                    state. Normally, this diversity makes for a stimulating academic environment,
                    but in the case of Wisconsin of 1970, it contributed to turbulence.</p>
                <p>I took a lot of economic development courses because my Brazilian experience
                    stimulated my curiosity about this process. Wisconsin has a very good Land
                    Tenure Center which is associated with the School of Agriculture. It had a
                    number of development and agricultural economists, as well as some very good
                    political scientists, such as Charles Anderson; many of them worked on African
                    issues. I took a regular graduate program in comparative political systems,
                    which was a precursor for a Ph.D. program. I briefly considered seeking a leave
                    of absence to complete the program, but decided instead on stopping at the
                    Master's level. I concentrated on comparative political systems and economic
                    development.</p>
                <p>I was sent to Wisconsin by the Department to pursue Latin American area studies
                    and Latin America-Portugal. The subject was broad enough to allow considerable
                    latitude in the studies. There were prerequisites to obtain a degree, and I
                    fulfilled these requirements. I already met the language requirements; that
                    helped. By taking the required courses, I was granted a Master's Degree in
                    Iberian-American studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished your tour in Wisconsin in 1971. What happened
                        next?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MELTON: I was assigned to work in the policy office in the Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs. That office was headed by Don Easum, who later became
                    Assistant Secretary for African Affairs and had several ambassadorial
                    appointments. He was from Madison, Wisconsin and visited the University while I
                    was there. He interviewed me and offered me a job in his office.</p>
                <p>All regional Bureaus had regional affairs or policy offices. They were intended
                    to worry about issues that went beyond the jurisdiction of any single country
                    office. In 1971, ARA was trying to establish an office that would link policy
                    objectives with resource allocations. It had put together some people to try to
                    establish such a system. One of the members of our team was a former
                    Presidential management intern who had also been a city planner in Michigan.
                    There were also other agency representatives on the team. The system we
                    developed was called the Country Analysis and Strategy Program or CASP.</p>
                <p>Our Assistant Secretary was first Charlie Meyer, followed by Jack Kubisch.
                    Charlie Meyer had come from Sears and Roebuck, and had many contacts in the
                    Latin America region. He was a delegator. Day-to-day direction of the bureau was
                    left to his very strong deputy, John Crimmins. Crimmins, an outstanding officer
                    in every respect, carried most of the planning and management workload.</p>
                <p>When I joined the office CASP was still in its embryonic stages. My assignment
                    was to work on CASP, which I did for most of my tour (three years) in the policy
                    office. During Bill Crockett's era as Deputy Under Secretary for Management in
                    the 1960s, the whole Department was experimenting with this concept. ARA had
                    progressed farther than any of the other regional bureaus. But its advance in
                    the effort to link resource allocations to policy were at best episodic; it had
                    peaks and valleys. The 1960s efforts never really came to full fruition, but by
                    1970 the decision had been reached to try again. The Department gave this new
                    effort support and encouraged the Bureau to move forward.</p>
                <p>One of the differences between 1971 and earlier efforts was the support for this
                    effort from other agencies. It was hoped that the new system would improve the
                    interagency decision making process. This support gave ARA the hope of being
                    able to include the resources of other agencies in the new planning system.</p>
                <p>This was the time of “Twilight of the Tyrants”—Tad Shultz's book which tracked
                    the changing political climate in Latin America. There were noticeable moves
                    away from military dictatorships—Venezuela, Dominican Republic. Even in
                    Nicaragua, where the Somozas still held sway, there were signs of political
                    opening. The situation today is of course much freer than it was in the early
                    1970s, but progress was being made.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>There were several assumptions behind the new policy planning effort. One of the
                    major considerations was the fact that very large amounts of resources were
                    flowing into the region, primarily under the Alliance of Progress through the
                    Agency for International Development (USAID). The planning system we were
                    developing would have amalgamated the systems that other agencies were using at
                    the time, giving decision makers a single document that would cover all U.S.
                    resources going into Latin America. The system was to be field-based—a very
                    valid concept—under the authority of the ambassador, who was to develop an
                    annual country plan. That plan was to be approved by an interagency group,
                    chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs using an
                    interagency process that had been blessed by the NSC.</p>
                <p>We hoped to cover all U.S. government agencies, including CIA. That agency's
                    program had been always dealt with separatively, but we were looking for ways to
                    capture its efforts as well—or at least to increase the Assistant Secretary's
                    oversight capabilities. It was and is true that the chief of mission had
                    supervisory responsibility for all U.S. government field activities, but there
                    were many activities that would escape an ambassador's oversight. We worked on
                    ways that an assistant secretary could be given more effective oversight
                    authority for these activities that might not have been directly linked to one
                    country. At the time, more than now, there were some activities which were being
                    deliberatively conducted by agencies other than the Department without policy
                    oversight. To bring those activities under adequate supervision was an up-hill
                    struggle; I think there was more interest and concern about this issue at the
                    working level than there was at the senior levels—particularly among the
                    non-career officials.</p>
                <p>I spent most of my time looking at large users of resources—big programs. Those
                    were areas of major concern to the US. There were some exceptions to that
                    general rule, but the large programs did need the most work. This was the period
                    when Fidel Castro was a major US concern; we also worried about communist or
                    nationalistic movements which appeared to be leading countries toward the
                    international communist movement. The countries which fell into this category
                    were the ones of greatest concern to the US—some in Central America, the
                    Caribbean, and Brazil from time to time (particularly the Northeast part of the
                    country).</p>
                <p>We had other concerns in the continent unrelated to the communist threat. These
                    stemmed from some nationalistic tendencies which were perceived as threats to US
                    interests—e.g. commercial. Besides outright expropriations, there were worries
                    about the general climate for the free flow of goods, which had a defense
                    implication because our defense concepts are based on the ability to move
                    resources relatively unimpeded from place to place particularly by air and
                    through international waters. So we worried about tuna fishing off Ecuador and
                    Peru which had implications for larger US concerns—territorial limits (12 miles
                    or 200 miles)—which included defense interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>As I suggested, the idea behind this interagency programming system was to first
                    look at our goals and objectives in each of the Latin American countries. Then
                    we examined what individual programs were trying to accomplish to ensure that
                    each program or project was supporting one or more of our fundamental goals
                    rather than an agency objective which might or might not be consistent with
                    overall U.S. priorities in a given country. Where interagency cooperation was
                    good and the Country Team leadership was strong, it was possible to link
                    programs to US goals; where those factors did not exist, the linkage was
                    difficult to evaluate. We instituted a country policy statement, written by the
                    chief of mission and approved by Washington, providing the overall justification
                    for the level of resources requested. Since almost all agencies worked from
                    field developed budgets—much more than now when so many resources are earmarked
                    by Washington—legislative and executive branches—and the use of funds is
                    dictated from the top—it was much easier to look at the relationship of programs
                    and projects to policy objectives in a country context.</p>
                <p>By using that concept—field based initiative, and the authority of the chief of
                    mission and the regional assistant secretary, who was the chairman of the
                    interagency NSC working group—we believed then there would be a better chance of
                    having an integrated and coherent approach in each country. If solid country
                    programs could be developed, then there was a good chance that a coherent
                    approach to the entire region could be achieved—with resources devoted to the
                    highest US policy objectives.</p>
                <p>We tried to develop a format which was detailed enough so that Washington could
                    pass some judgement on the validity of the country team proposal to ensure that
                    there was close relationship stated objectives and that activities proposed to
                    advance those objectives. We first called for a country plan, to be approved by
                    all agencies. The projects and programs of all agencies were laid out in matrix
                    form that one could readily see the relationship between the country policy
                    objectives and specific agency programs and projects. The country submission
                    started with a brief essay, outlining the country team's objectives—that is, the
                    chief of mission's views on policy objectives to be pursued and a statement of
                    strategy for the near term, as well as a statement of problems and barriers to
                    achieving US policy objectives in that particular country.</p>
                <p>The essay was accompanied by a plan, detailing goals and objectives—the
                    difference being the time frame—goals were longer range and objectives were
                    shorter run to be achieved in the one-year period under review. The need for
                    these goals and objectives to be measurable was always stressed—all of the buzz
                    words we talk about now were very much in vogue then. In some ways, we were more
                    advanced then than we are now.</p>
                <p>This interagency planning process was much further advanced in ARA than in any of
                    the other regional bureaus. Our efforts have subsequently been the subject of
                    several scholarly works on foreign affairs budgeting. It has been cited as one
                    of the most ambitious efforts ever mounted to implement the basic concept.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>My office in ARA was the manager of the process. The first submissions always
                    came from the field, leaving much initiative to the chief of mission. Washington
                    was a review level—for the policies and programs recommended by the field. While
                    policy and resource constraints were established by Washington, we did not
                    dictate the policies to the field.</p>
                <p>During my tour in ARA, Allende was overthrown in Chile—1973. Some people in the
                    bureau at the time—e.g. Harry Shlaudeman had been in Chile as DCM—when these
                    events took place. He returned to Washington as a DAS in the Bureau. Since he
                    was being considered for other senior positions, his work while in Chile was
                    being scrutinized closely as was the whole Bureau's efforts on the Chile issues.
                    Allende had been a major concern for ARA; the critical period came just prior to
                    an election when Allende was to run again. The polls in Chile were quite clear
                    that Allende would lose his bid for re-election. That was one of the factors
                    that was subsequently cited—and rightly so—to counter the contention that
                    Allende's overthrow was a wholly US generated effort. The Chileans
                    themselves—and of course the Chilean military—had had enough.</p>
                <p>I must say that the planning job was less than satisfactory. It is true that we
                    were involved in policy development and certainly in implementation, but I was
                    discouraged by what I considered a lack of seriousness in the planning process;
                    I thought the process had considerable potential and I believed the leadership
                    of ARA and the Department should have given it more attention and support.
                    Failures in this area continue to plague the Department to this day.</p>
                <p>John Crimmins did see its advantages and, under his leadership, great strides
                    were made towards getting a better fix on resource allocation across agency
                    lines. But that was not a uniform view within the bureau, and when Kubisch took
                    over, a lot of steam went out of the effort—it was back to “business as usual.”
                    The process could raise the issues that needed to be resolved, but without front
                    office determination to deal with the issues raised, the programming system just
                    languished. So I left ARA with some sense of frustration; I thought that the
                    process we had launched could have become a very useful management tool, but
                    unfortunately, its potential was never exploited by either the bureau or the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left ARA in 1975. What was your next assignment</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: I went to Portugal. I had served in Latin America for practically my
                    whole career. I thought it was time to move to another area of the world. I
                    served in Portugal from 1975 to 1978.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Circumstances in Portugal were fortuitous. There had been a revolution in 1974
                    led by a group of young Army officers, disillusioned by there experiences
                    fighting a losing colonial war in Africa. The Marxist were making major efforts
                    to take over the new government. So I thought that the political situation
                    looked very interesting. I spoke Portuguese, and Portugal was not in Latin
                    America. It all looked pretty attractive to me. So I inquired about upcoming
                    vacancies; I was told the principal officer job at the Consulate General in
                    Oporto might be available. Oporto was the major town in northern Portugal—a
                    center of conservatism, and a potential counterweight to leftists in the south.
                    I made a bid for that job. I thought I was a strong candidate; in fact, the job
                    went to the staff assistant of the then Assistant Secretary for Consular
                    Affairs. The fix was in before I even had a chance to compete for the job. I was
                    annoyed. I knew the new ambassador, Frank Carlucci—I met him when he and I were
                    serving in Brazil. I called him and told him I was upset about the selection
                    process, since I thought I was better qualified than the person who got the job.
                    Frank remembered who I was, but confirmed that the Oporto position was a “done
                    deal;” he did however mention that he was expanding the political section in
                    Lisbon and suggested that I put my name forward for one of these positions. I
                    did and was assigned to Lisbon.</p>
                <p>Pre-revolutionary Portugal was an assignment that had been much sought after. If
                    anything, there was even more after the revolution. This said, the quality of
                    the people I encountered in the Embassy was mixed. The Portuguese political
                    system had been very stable, but sign of change began to appear well before the
                    revolution. But I did not think that our Embassy people had focused on this
                    change—sufficiently at least. That was the major problem at the Embassy.</p>
                <p>The issue in Portugal, which was mirrored in Spain, was the presence of an aging
                    dictator. The question in such situation is always whether there is a transition
                    in process or is power just being transferred to another dictator. In Portugal,
                    it had been clear for some time that the regime was becoming fatigued and that
                    Salazar's successors were having increasing difficulties holding the regime
                    together. In retrospect, I don't think we saw this phenomenon early enough;
                    therefore we were surprised when the change actually took place and Salazar's
                    successors were unceremoniously thrown out.</p>
                <p>The change was a problem for the Embassy which had very good contacts with the
                    regime formerly in power and poor to non-existent contacts with the new people.
                    Furthermore, the Embassy was viewed by the new crowd with some suspicion because
                    of its intimacy with the old regime. In trying to deal with the political change
                    and the new faces on the scene, the Embassy was hampered by all these challenges
                    and could not do an effective job in representing the US. That led to a decision
                    to turnover much of the Embassy's staff; Frank Carlucci was appointed as
                    Ambassador and he brought in Herb Okun as DCM. In addition, the staff was almost
                    completely changed and increased.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I did not perceive paranoia before leaving Washington, but once I got to Lisbon,
                    I immediately got a feeling of desperation; i.e. that Portugal was being lost to
                    NATO and turning toward the communists. That soon became the dominant view in
                    Washington. This studied pessimism created problems for managing policy and
                    relations because the tendency was to “write off” Portugal in part to “show the
                    rest of Europe” what the consequences would be to lean toward communism. The
                    assumption was that the leftist regime in Portugal would make such an economic
                    mess that other countries, such as Italy, would be inoculated against communism;
                    that is, would not be tempted to follow in Portugal's path.</p>
                <p>One of the implications of that view touched on our air base in the Azores, which
                    was at some distance—geographically as well as psychologically—from Lisbon. The
                    activists among the Washington Nay-sayers assumed that the Azores had national
                    separatist tendencies which could be fanned, thereby allowing us to keep our
                    base there regardless of the events in Lisbon. There were even those who thought
                    that Portugal might well come apart with the Azores or other parts of Portugal
                    seeking independence.</p>
                <p>If you didn't buy the view that Portugal was going communist and that that would
                    be a good example for the rest of Europe, then one had a difficult challenge in
                    viewing the situation positively. But there was another point of view—that, in
                    time, became the Embassy view. Portugal was not “lost” but rather was going
                    through a phase of political development which need not result in a communist
                    takeover. This interpretation was supported by the presence in Portugal of some
                    dedicated proponents of democracy and the essentially conservative nature of the
                    majority of the Portuguese population. This view held that eventually the
                    democratic tendencies of the Portuguese would reassert themselves and therefore
                    Portugal should not be “written off.”</p>
                <p>It was these two perspectives which clashed in the development of US policy
                    toward Portugal. Carlucci's view was that we should support the democrats and
                    stick with Portugal, which would eventually become a respected member of the
                    European community. The Embassy staff shared this issue.</p>
                <p>The political split in Portugal in the mid-1970s was on the left of the spectrum
                    since the right had essentially been so denigrated that it had little influence.
                    The competition for power was essentially among three groups: the Socialist
                    Party; the Communist Party; and the Armed Forces, at the time led by young
                    officers of the Captain's Movement. I was assigned to cover the first group, the
                    Socialists; I had some help but I was the main contact person. Gradually, I
                    expanded my associations to include some members of the “Captain's Movement;” I
                    developed some good contacts within that group. By the time my tour ended, I had
                    been promoted to head of the Political Section, after initially serving as
                    deputy.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The Embassy was filled with people who did not have much more experience in
                    Portugal than I did. My job was to establish and maintain contact with the
                    Socialist Party. I had never met a socialist party member before. I asked how I
                    might go about doing this. I was told that as a political officer, I needed to
                    figure this out for myself. No one else in the Embassy knew the Socialists
                    either. So I found where the Party headquarters was and walked in. I learned
                    about the Party structure. I went from individual to individual, expanding
                    my—and the Embassy's—contacts with the Socialist Party. So I started from the
                    bottom and worked my way up in the structure, which was not easy since we were
                    viewed with great suspicion by Party members.</p>
                <p>I don't want to overstress that suspicion; it did exist, but it was not uniformly
                    held by all party members. There were elements within the Socialist Party that
                    certainly did view us with antagonism. The Party had been in exile for many
                    years; Mario Soares, the head of the Party at the time, had previously been a
                    member of the Communist Party. So in Portugal we had the classic
                    communist-socialist split; whether you were one or the other, depended in great
                    part on non-political factors—family relationships, historical circumstances,
                    etc. Gradually, before my arrival, however, it became clear who were the
                    democrats and who were the authoritarians. The Socialists were the democrats.
                    But there were still doctrinaire members of the Socialist Party who were much to
                    the left than the party rank and file and more suspicious of the U.S. and the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, my first contacts were with people who were solidly in the
                    democratic camp. In time I became acquainted with the more extreme elements. I
                    found that slowly but surely I could build comfortable relationships with most
                    elements of the Party, including doctrinaire leftists. I began with the
                    International Division of the Party; that was the logical starting point for a
                    foreigner. It was the Party's point of contact with embassies in Lisbon; they
                    were used to dealing with diplomats.</p>
                <p>Soares was largely unknown to us, despite his extensive political experience.
                    Initially, people pointed to his communist background. There were questions
                    about whether he was really a “democrat.” That skepticism was quickly resolved
                    within the Embassy. His early actions clearly showed his inclinations; there was
                    no question in our minds that he was a democrat. I don't know that Washington
                    came to the same realization as quickly.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Getting to know other Party members was a greater challenge. I tried to expand
                    relationship by relationship. Sometime I found it necessary to call on an
                    official and introduce myself—explaining who I was, what my job was and why the
                    relationship I was trying to establish was not part of a nefarious US plot but
                    might well work to the advantage of all concerned. By and large, I think most
                    people accepted this view, but there were some who continued to view all U.S.
                    government activities with great suspicion, which spilled over to me personally.
                    In those situations, I would try to find an intermediary who would introduce or
                    refer me to the skeptic; that would indicate that I was not a total stranger,
                    but I was known to members of the Party. That worked pretty well; gradually,
                    even that hostility which initially had existed, dissipated and people became
                    sufficiently open.</p>
                <p>As I said, most Party members were democrats; so that even if they had a bad
                    experience with the U.S. or were just ideologically suspicious, we did have a
                    shared view on a preferred political system; so if we could reach that common
                    ground, a dialogue could be established. I must say that our then current
                    foreign policy problems—particularly El Salvador—were great fodder for European
                    socialists, including the Portuguese; they used to beat up on us for these
                    “failings.” The Portuguese socialists were part of the Western European
                    movement; many of them had close contacts with fellow Party members in France,
                    UK, Sweden, and other countries. Some financial support flowed from those
                    countries to the Portuguese Socialist Party. The Socialist International was
                    also active, and I came to know and respect the local SI representative, Berne
                    Carlsson.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese were and continue to be spread out all over Europe as “guest”
                    workers. It is too often overlooked that when they work outside of Portugal,
                    they are often in subordinate positions. So if you are an exiled Socialist Party
                    leader or just a member, you may be welcomed by your “brother” in a foreign
                    country, but it is not usually a comradeship of equals. The Portuguese were the
                    foreigner and could never quite get across that hurdle. So often he or she would
                    not take on entirely the views of the local Party. I developed relationships
                    with Party members who had been in exile in the UK or Scandinavia; it was quite
                    clear that their experiences were not uniformly positive; they were always in a
                    subordinate position. Financially, many had to rely on the generosity of foreign
                    party members; that too is sometimes hard to swallow.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Of course, the fact that there were many Portuguese who had emigrated to the U.S.
                    helped in some ways. Many came from the Azores and ended up in Massachusetts.
                    The Portuguese communities in the U.S. often began as fishing communities on the
                    East Coast or in San Diego. They were very independent—as most professional
                    fishermen have to be. But some of those emigres suffered from a time warp. They
                    viewed Portugal as they might have remembered it from many years earlier—before
                    they emigrated. So their views of Portuguese society and politics were sometimes
                    far out of date. For many, what was happening in Portugal was not in conformance
                    with their views of how their country should behave. So some of these emigres
                    responded by supporting separatist movements in the Azores as a way of putting
                    pressure on the authorities in Lisbon.</p>
                <p>Basically the support by the American Portuguese communities was rooted in their
                    perceptions of what was going on in Portugal—perceptions which were not always
                    accurate, in my judgement. It was the role of the Embassy to try to ensure that
                    the U.S. government, and through it the Portuguese communities in the United
                    States, had current and accurate information on political developments in
                    Portugal. I think the Embassy did have differences with Washington on policy.
                    Our perception of what was going on in Portugal, personified in Ambassador
                    Carlucci's views and representations, was, as I suggested earlier, somewhat
                    different from Washington. Ambassador Carlucci represented our views very
                    effectively and I think, as subsequent events bore out, that he and the Embassy
                    were right—Portugal did not “go down the drain,” but remained a steadfast member
                    of the European democratic community.</p>
                <p>I might here just make a comment on the management team. In Embassy Lisbon,
                    Ambassador Carlucci worked through people and placed full confidence in his
                    staff. He encouraged individuals to perform to their maximum capacity by giving
                    staff members responsibility to do a job with minimal interference. That I think
                    enhanced the performance of the Embassy staff. The DCM was much more a
                    micro-manager—although he might not agree with my characterization. He wanted to
                    put his stamp on each report or action. The high-level interest in the Embassy's
                    work encouraged this approach. To his great credit, Ambassador Carlucci resisted
                    this approach, and he, not the DCM, had the final word. Ambassador Carlucci knew
                    the DCM's strengths and weaknesses well; so the Embassy worked quite well, under
                    two strong, but quite different senior officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I think the morale of the Embassy during this period was very high. In the first
                    place we were on the front lines in a very unusual political situation which
                    generated great controversy. In the second place, we had an Ambassador who
                    carried considerable weight in Washington; he had been the Deputy Secretary at
                    HEW before coming to Lisbon. His views could not be easily ignored or dismissed
                    by Secretary of State Kissinger. All of the members of the staff had well
                    defined areas of responsibilities; they were challenging because in part they
                    were new—that is, the jobs had not existed before and many of us were therefore
                    breaking new ground. We were establishing relationships that had never existed
                    before. The stakes were high, and I think we all had a sense of being involved
                    in significant issues. There was a pressure to produce and to make judgements
                    which would be proven correct by subsequent events. Our reports had to reach
                    conclusions; events were moving too rapidly; we had to make decisions then and
                    there. Each event needed to be put in some broader framework and to state
                    clearly the implications for the United States. Ambassador Carlucci was of
                    course ultimately responsible for all of the judgements and conclusions, but we
                    would put our views on each report. Carlucci would read some reports before they
                    went out and some after the fact, but he saw everything. Occasionally he would
                    ask a drafting officer what he or she was trying to say and how much confidence
                    the reader should have in the conclusions reached. Sometimes, he would not find
                    the evidence that conclusive; that would either force us to find more evidence
                    or to modify our written conclusion to indicate some ambiguity in the evidence.
                    But those were rare situations; in most cases he would agree with my
                    conclusions—he of course had independent sources in the Socialist Party,
                    including Party leader Mario Soares whom he saw frequently.</p>
                <p>Many people said that the Portuguese government was run by Marxists. It was not
                    that simple. In the first place, the government was controlled by the “Captains
                    Movement”—the group of young officers that was formed through the African
                    colonial wars. The term “Captains” derived from the fact that this Movement was
                    initially founded by small unit commanders fighting a guerrilla war—Captains
                    would command company sized units. These individuals later coalesced into a
                    political bloc, led by the Captains and a few more senior officers. In any case,
                    the “Captains” became the prime movers behind the revolutionary government. They
                    brought into the government some civilians, including some associated with the
                    Communist Party. Prime Minister Vasco Gon�alves was not a Communist Party
                    member, but the U.S. government was inclined to believe that if he walked like a
                    communist, talked like a communist; he must be a communist or at the very least
                    a tool of the communists. The question arose, “What was he?” He did appear to be
                    a Marxist, and some leaped to that judgement, thereby also placing Portugal in
                    the “lost” column.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The “Captains Movement” did not have a political base nor a party structure nor
                    was it supported by all of the armed forces. So it was not likely to produce, on
                    its own, a regime with much lasting power. Therefore the issue became which
                    party would dominate the politics of Portugal as the Captains receded. That
                    brought the Communists and Socialist into competition which manifested itself
                    very soon after the system was opened up and people were allowed to participate
                    through electoral politics. Both the communists and socialists quickly developed
                    party structures which prepared them for the political competition.</p>
                <p>The Communist Party was led by Alvaro Cunhal, who was Moscow-aligned, thoroughly
                    orthodox and a hard liner. There was no significant Euro-communist wing within
                    the Portuguese Communist Party, Cunhal moved in lock-step with Moscow. The
                    members knew to follow the party line rigidly. In fact, that made our task
                    somewhat easier; the communists were very rigid and were slow to react. On the
                    other hand the socialists followed the democratic path of Mario Soares. There
                    were some permutations, but by and large, it was Soares' views which held sway.
                    By and large, that was the dichotomy in Portugal; the choice for the U.S. was
                    easy.</p>
                <p>The Soviets were very much involved in Portuguese politics. They tended to
                    operate through surrogates—the East Germans, Cubans, Bulgarians, and others. The
                    Soviet hand was quite noticeable even when the work was done through the
                    surrogates. It was hard to deal with them because so many embassies representing
                    “sovereign” powers were involved. There was a division of labor; some embassies
                    were asked to do certain tasks by the Soviets and others were left to other
                    missions. In our analysis of what the Soviets were doing, we had to keep in mind
                    what all the surrogate embassies were doing.</p>
                <p>It was difficult enough to establish contacts with the “Captains Movement.” We
                    were not entirely popular with the armed forces because of our African policies.
                    In addition, the captains and majors, when they decided to seize political
                    power, had ruptured their ties to their own military establishment. The military
                    also became divided in its views of what Portugal should do. The captains and
                    majors were really uncertain of their roles or of the role of the armed forces;
                    they were not all career military; many had been drafted into the officer corps
                    because Portugal needed more manpower than its standing army could provide to
                    fight the colonial wars. So many of the captains and majors entered the service
                    when the armed forces had been greatly expanded, but were not really a part of
                    the hard military cast. They were somewhat easier to approach than the more
                    traditional military man who routinely reported every contact through the chain
                    of command, to be told that the contact had been appropriate or not. With
                    “civilian” captains and majors, there was much less stringent command and
                    control. The government structure was not nearly as cohesive as it appeared from
                    the outside. No one had actually made an effort to talk to junior officers; that
                    gave me an advantage. Also they were age contemporaries of mine; that seemed to
                    make it somewhat easier even though I have never found age to be a big factor in
                    making contacts. With the captains and majors, I didn't have to have referrals.
                    In fact, among the “Captains,” it would probably have been harmful if one tried
                    to use one member to get introduction to others; more doors would have been
                    closed that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Our own military did not have good contacts with the “Captains.” We had some
                    effective attach�s, who did very good and essential work, but they were not very
                    helpful to me in making contacts; I had to make my own. I found that the members
                    of the “Captains Movement” were as interested in talking to us as we were with
                    them. As I said, many were not professional military men; they were curious
                    about the US. One of my first contacts was the spokesman for the Movement; he
                    was interested in matters beyond the military. I told him that I was new on the
                    scene, as he essentially was, and that we both might find occasional
                    conversations to be useful to both of us. He agreed and that started a
                    relationship that lasted for the rest of my tour in Portugal.</p>
                <p>It was clear that the military, especially the Armed Forces Movement was a key
                    player in Portuguese affairs. It was incumbent on me as well as my
                    colleagues—and not just the attach�s—to develop contacts with these people; it
                    really didn't make much difference who opened up the channels of communications;
                    the important thing was that such channels were opened. Our attach�s were very
                    good in discharging the duties for which they had been trained; they were not as
                    good at opening dialogues for political purposes. Ironically, the attach�s were
                    not comfortable dealing with people of authority outside the military command
                    structure; for me, that came naturally. I used first of all to try to determine
                    who was significant; secondly, I would see whether anyone in the Embassy was
                    already in touch with those individuals; if the latter answer was negative, then
                    I would try to establish such contact. Both in Brazil and Portugal with the
                    socialists, I just knocked on likely doors; I frequently had no way to get
                    “proper” introductions. I just presented myself and gave the best reasons that I
                    could think of for the individual to talk to me. So Brazil was a good learning
                    ground; I used some of the same techniques in Portugal, where at times, opening
                    doors was more difficult because we were viewed by some with great suspicion and
                    sometimes hostility—although I encountered some of the same skepticism in
                    Brazil. I found that it was important on first meeting to start at the
                    beginning; who I was, what and why the U.S. was interested in a specific
                    subject—to take nothing for granted. There was nothing mysterious about it, it
                    was a straight forward and legitimate diplomatic function. It worked quite
                    well.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Conversations always have two aspects. One is to determine the rationale used by
                    your interlocutor on some subjects; that explains in part why certain things are
                    happening. In the case of the Socialist Party, it was important to grasp what
                    its goals were and how it expected to achieve them. That enabled us to better
                    understand what was going on in Portugal at the time and what the prospects for
                    success might have been. The other aspect was a presentation of the U.S. view on
                    a subject—where it was appropriate for us to have views, which was true in more
                    cases than people imagine. By expressing our views, we hope to influence the
                    listener to be sympathetic to our preferences. At best, we could find common
                    policy objectives; that would establish some sort of unity of purpose which is
                    obviously a desired situation. So conversations did have an element of each side
                    trying to convince the other on certain positions. In the end, it is important
                    that diplomats make judgements, and it is fair to hold them accountable for
                    those judgements. You are assigned to get it right; if you don't, you haven't
                    done your job.</p>
                <p>The European socialist parties were providing financial support to their
                    Portuguese brother. This was provided bilaterally and through the Socialist
                    International. At the time, the German contribution came in effect from tax
                    revenues cycled through party institutions primarily in the Socialist Party.
                    Each German party had an Institute or Foundation which was used to provide
                    support to their foreign ideological allies. At the time, this was a major
                    source of resources for all parties including the socialist. The communists
                    relied on support from Moscow channeled through a variety of avenues. The
                    Chinese were also active, but on a much smaller scale.</p>
                <p>The democratic parties all had common objectives; a democratic regime in
                    Portugal. That was our goal as well. Having said that, however, we had to admit
                    that the socialist parties had their own agendas; there were tendencies in
                    northern European parties which might have some things in common with southern
                    European parties and some things on which they differed markedly. Each might
                    have their own preferences for a Portuguese Socialist Party structure or they
                    each might have had different preferences for leadership. The Portuguese Party
                    was run by a leadership elected in at annual conventions; the leader had to
                    devote much time to building up constituencies which will support him. So when
                    the vote is taken, the results are usually not a surprise. The inflow from
                    foreign funds could be decisive in influencing the outcome of the annual
                    convention, although few Socialists would like to admit it. The leaders also had
                    the advantage of incumbency. The Portuguese Socialist Party cadres which
                    returned from exile, included many people who were unknown quantities even among
                    long-time party members. The track record of all leadership candidates had been
                    interrupted by the exile; so an observer could not be fully confident of the
                    position that any member of the Party might take once in power. So there was
                    ample room for discussion and disagreement on the near term future of the Party
                    and the direction it might take. There was a lot of discussion within and
                    outside the Party about its future; so it was a very dynamic and effervescent
                    period.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>We were concerned that the single-minded dogmatic approach of the communist might
                    win out over the squabbling, disputatious socialist. This challenge was
                    certainly a serious concern for the socialists. But ironically, one of the
                    advantages the Socialist Party had was it had in its senior leadership people
                    who had come from the Communist Party—a Stalinist Party. These people were quite
                    aware of the tactics and strategies that their former colleagues would follow
                    and knew the strengths and weaknesses of the communists. They were just as
                    energetic and purposeful as were the communists. Communists often have an
                    advantage in that they controlled the streets. That was not true in Portugal.
                    There the communist might bring out 50,000 people to demonstrate only to find
                    that the socialists had mobilized 60,000 in another part of town; the socialists
                    matched the communists at every juncture. They knew the communist tactics and
                    managed to counter them and mount their own campaign in a democratic
                    fashion.</p>
                <p>The NATO connection was important because it was composed of democratic nations
                    and held out the prospect of an EC connection and eventual membership in the
                    European communities. This democratic presumption was important for Portuguese
                    political development. Had that connection been severed, Portugal might have
                    been written out of the democratic club. As far as the Portuguese military was
                    concerned, it was in a state of flux during this period. It did not stabilize
                    until later when the whole Portuguese society came to a conclusion about its
                    future. But even in this period of flux the NATO connection was important to the
                    three elements of the Portuguese armed forces: Army, Air Force, and Navy. There
                    was a NATO naval headquarters right outside of Lisbon—the Iberian Atlantic
                    command. That was the source of some prestige for the Portuguese, particularly
                    for the Navy. To have closed that down would have a serious negative implication
                    and would have weakened the Portuguese democratic movement in its efforts to
                    assert itself.</p>
                <p>Eventually, it was the military that took the leadership in re-establishing
                    democratic institutions in Portugal within the revolution. To have cut the NATO
                    or EC connection, as some in Washington urged, would have made that task much
                    more difficult.</p>
                <p>I do not like to generalize, but I would have to say that Portuguese society was
                    very conservative and traditional. The Armed Forces Movement superimposed on
                    that society in 1974; it was a mismatch because the society and the Movement did
                    not share common values. The majority of the Portuguese people live in the
                    north—many in rural areas; the south was the base for the communists and the far
                    left—as well as some of the industrial sections of Lisbon. So it was just a
                    matter of time before Portuguese conservatism, centered in the North reasserted
                    itself; it represented the majority. The communists under-played their hand.
                    Perhaps they should have taken control in the 1974-75 period when they were at
                    the zenith of their influence; their vote count was well above 20%. The
                    communists did not take advantage of their temporary position and that,
                    according to some, was a serious error in judgement. Time was not in their
                    favor, and they missed their opportunity.</p>

                <p>Long-time Spanish ruler Francisco Franco died while I was in Lisbon. People may
                    not agree with my analysis, but I think it was fortunate that the transition to
                    democracy and the Iberian peninsula started in Portugal. The outcome in both
                    countries was good. Spain had the advantage of having watched developments in
                    Portugal; the Socialist Workers Party there benefitted from having its sister
                    party in Portugal take the lead in bringing political openness to a country
                    governed by a dictatorship. The Spaniards saw that democrats like Mario Soares
                    and Felipe Gonzalez could be successful. I don't think that we should overstate
                    the case—the Spaniards probably would not agree with this analysis—but I do
                    believe that events in Portugal made it easier for Spain to build a democratic
                    government after Franco's death. It certainly made events in Spain more
                    palatable to Washington; we had seen that transitions were not necessarily
                    damaging to our interests and therefore had greater tolerance for events in
                    Spain. So I think what happened in Portugal may have been even more significant
                    than it might have been otherwise; in the context of the times, even events in a
                    small country could have wider ramifications, particularly when the transition
                    was as successful as it was in Portugal.</p>
                <p>I believe that the transition in Portugal was a significant success for American
                    diplomacy. We had a new ambassador and a new staff which managed to change the
                    views of a Secretary of State who was not known for his flexibility—or his
                    optimism about Portugal. Henry Kissinger might have written Portugal off, but
                    Ambassador Carlucci managed to hold the line and, in the final analysis,
                    preserve Portugal for the western alliance. So this was an important period.</p>
                <p>I look back on my Foreign Service career and consider the staff of Embassy Lisbon
                    to have been among the best that I ever worked with. I think they were some of
                    the top people in the Foreign Service. The Political Section had Charlie
                    Thomas—later our Ambassador to Hungary and a negotiator in Bosnia; Joe
                    Sullivan—until recently the head of our office in Havana; Mark Paris—our
                    Ambassador to Turkey, at the time a relatively junior officer who had served in
                    the Azores and was therefore a key member of the staff; Wes Eagan—now our
                    Ambassador in Amman. So we had an outstanding group of officers who were highly
                    motivated, able to start contacts from scratch, and eager to work.</p>
                <p>Our desk in the Bureau of European Affairs dealt with us with a very light hand.
                    I did not sense that it was either an obstacle or a great asset, either. The
                    dialogue about Portuguese issues took place at higher levels. The Office
                    Director, Bob Barbour, was experienced and wise, but I think the key issues were
                    being tackled far above him.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>As I said, this was a difficult and turbulent period in Lisbon. We had to lease
                    our own quarters, which was difficult because the economy had been seriously
                    disrupted—people taking over property. There were houses available, but we had
                    to find them ourselves, which was alright, except that it was very time
                    consuming. Many of those with property had abandoned the country; land invasions
                    and property takeovers were widespread. The Embassy's administrative support
                    infrastructure was inadequate to assist the expanded staff. There were some
                    questions which in retrospect were probably more important than they seemed at
                    the time. We didn't have any housing standards—what was an appropriate size
                    residence; there were many landlords who were anxious to leave the country and
                    were willing to rent their places to diplomats at a great discount. Many of
                    these homes were palatial; under later housing standards, the question of
                    appropriateness might well have been raised. I lived in a relatively modest
                    place.</p>
                <p>Portugal can be quite cold in the winter and most houses did not have central
                    heating. That could be a real problem. My house was usually cold in winter. We
                    did have some concerns for personal safety. I was considerably younger and
                    probably wasn't as concerned as I should have been. But it was not my first tour
                    and I had learned enough about self-preservation which stood me in good stead.
                    We did have to be careful, particularly in crowds; violence was always a
                    possibility—young people carried weapons even if they really didn't know how to
                    use them nor were they particularly disciplined. Being stopped at road blocks by
                    armed militia was not an unusual phenomenon; the fact that you might have been a
                    diplomat cut little ice; we had to open the trunks of our cars just like every
                    one else, following instructions given by a teenager with an automatic weapon.
                    It was particularly uncomfortable to families who might be stopped while
                    driving. In general, it was a very hard tour for families who often took second
                    place to workplace demands.</p>
                <p>Periodically, the topic of US policy in Africa would arise in my conversations
                    with my Portuguese friends. This was the period of heavy Cuban involvement in
                    Africa. We knew about Cuban troop movements in Angola. We were involved on the
                    periphery in Portuguese efforts to disengage from Angola and Mozambique without
                    allowing Marxists to take control. We were not central to this discussion
                    because the Portuguese had in effect washed their hands of their former
                    colonies, although there were still strong connections between some Portuguese
                    leaders and political parties in the former colonies. So at the edges we tried
                    to play a helpful role, but I don't think we were particularly significant or
                    successful. The issues, by this time, were beyond our control.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>By the time I departed Portugal in 1978, I left a country very much on the rise.
                    The power had shifted; an elected President, General Eanes, a relatively young
                    senior officer who reflected the mainstream views of the military, was the head
                    of government. The Socialist Party had won the general elections; Soares had
                    served as Prime Minister. The Social Democrats had also won an election. That
                    demonstrated that democratic principles were well in place and that the
                    electorate had a wide choice from democratically-oriented political parties.
                    This new atmosphere was proof of the successful transition that Portugal had
                    passed through and gave observers solid reasons to expect a continuation of
                    democratic practices in that country. The negotiations for entry into the EC
                    were well underway and although the formal entrance was still distant because of
                    economic aspects that had to be changed to meet EC standards, it was clear that
                    Portugal would eventually enter the community because it had the will to do so
                    and because it now met democratic standards of that group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Portugal in 1978 and went to the National War
                        College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: That is right. I had a very interesting year. Our military, even five
                    years after our exodus from Vietnam, was still traumatized by that experience.
                    In 1978, it was still in a state of denial. For example, our curriculum did not
                    have any mention of Vietnam at all—as if it didn't happen. We covered Europe, we
                    covered World War II and even the Civil War. Very little was said about Vietnam
                    although almost all of my military classmates had participated.</p>
                <p>The War College is always going through re-evaluations of its academic program
                    and curriculum. During the year I was there, it was going through one of these
                    periodic appraisals. The principal questions—then and I suspect always—was: Is
                    the War College an academic institution or is it something else? What justifies
                    its existence? By this time, a self-evaluation had been completed and had
                    concluded that the curriculum had to be more rigorous. I think that was probably
                    a good idea. This conclusion was implemented in part by the introduction of a
                    Master's program and a core curriculum to be followed by all students at the War
                    College and its sister institution, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.
                    At the same time, more flexibility was provided in choosing courses. Units could
                    be taken at either institution; we had a lot of leeway in what we chose to
                    study—and that was good.</p>
                <p>I found that new flexibility very useful. The War College had a decent library
                    and some good people on the faculty. I hooked up with one of those professors
                    and did a lot of independent reading in addition to taking offered courses. I
                    took one in quantitative methodology and others that interested me. Frankly, I
                    took more courses at the Industrial College which tended to be more progressive,
                    than I did at the War College. My general studies did not really have any
                    concentration. We did have to write several papers. I found the independent
                    reading of greatest value; there I concentrated on various concepts of political
                    theory, methods for analyzing the macro content of political societies—in
                    general, trying to update my education on subjects that I had last studied at
                    university.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I did form some impressions about our military services views of the War
                    College—and military education in general. The service which placed the greatest
                    emphasis on continuing education seemed to be the Air Force. Their officers
                    seemed to be of the highest quality; my view of the Air Force was reinforced by
                    my conversations with officers from that service about their careers. It was
                    clear that the Air Force put greater emphasis on continuing education than the
                    other services. Next came the Army, the Marines, trailed by the Navy which
                    appeared to place no emphasis at all on continuing education—certainly not on
                    attendance at the War College or the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. The
                    quality of the Navy students reflected that lack of interest.</p>
                <p>I was reminded of the time I had spent years earlier with a Congressman under the
                    Congressional Fellowship Program. I participated in the screening of applicants
                    for the military service academies. One of the requirements was to take the SAT
                    (the Scholastic Aptitude Test). We had some other ways as well to rank the
                    applicants. The services were happy to do the initial screening for the
                    Congressman; that was done, but the final selection was left to the principal.
                    This process gave some assurance that the successful candidates were at least
                    minimally qualified and would be accepted by academies.</p>
                <p>I learned at the time what the academic levels were for each academy and the
                    highest test scores went to the Air Force Academy—especially for math and
                    sciences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1979, what was your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: One of the problems the Department had—and has today—is to find
                    assignments which make sense in terms of the academic training an officer may
                    just have received. In most cases there was and is no plan for the next
                    assignment for an officer assigned to senior training. So in 1979, the Foreign
                    Service students at the War College—about 15—met with the Director General
                    toward the end of our academic year. There were no plans for onward assignments.
                    Those in senior training outside the Department were at a competitive
                    disadvantage for assignments. You tend to lose contact with the Department if
                    you are not there every day. So as we neared the end of our study period, most
                    of us did not have onward assignments. The Director General did not help despite
                    a huge amount of hand wringing. In the end, the system worked as it always does;
                    the officer had to find his or her own assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>That I did and I knocked on doors. I had pretty much decided that I would like to
                    try Latin America again. Because of my prior assignment, that was the most
                    likely area for a responsible job. I met with Bob Sayre, at the time our
                    Ambassador in Brazil. Although my personal grade was below that of the position,
                    I convinced Sayre that I should be his Political Counselor. At just about that
                    time, I got a very welcome call from a friend in London, who said that although
                    my previous attempt to get a job there hadn't worked, it might now. He wanted to
                    know whether I was still interested in a job in the Political Section. I said,
                    “Sure.”</p>
                <p>A few days later, I received a call from Kingston Brewster, our Ambassador to the
                    Court of St. James, asking me whether I was interested in a job in his Political
                    Section. My answer was the same; “Sure.” And off to London I went where I worked
                    for three years. I chose London over Brasilia—even though it was a lower graded
                    position—because the bulk of my career still had been in Latin America. I
                    continued to believe that I needed to become more familiar with—at least another
                    area of the world—I suppose this view was reinforced by my experience at the War
                    College. London was a great opportunity to get an additional perspective—not to
                    mention all of the advantages of living in London.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, my job was deputy in the Political Section. It was a large
                    section with about ten officers. My responsibilities, in addition to the
                    management of the Section, included coverage of the Labor Party and Latin
                    American issues as they concerned the British. I had been recruited for that job
                    specifically, in part because of my work in Portugal with the socialists there.
                    I also had some familiarity with defense issues as well as the general spectrum
                    of political work. The Embassy was very selective about its staff. It could
                    afford to be. It tried as best it could to match the work to the talents and
                    experiences of the new arrivals. It actively recruited whenever vacancies
                    occurred and tried to find the right person for every upcoming vacancy. London
                    had great advantages, it could offer a living and working environment which
                    could not be matched by most other embassies. And as good officers went there,
                    that attracted other good officers to bid on assignments to London. In the late
                    1970s, London was riding a pretty good wave. The Political Section was
                    formidable—Tom Simons, now our Ambassador to Pakistan, was the Political
                    Counselor; Jack Binns, whom I replaced, became our Ambassador to Honduras; Jim
                    Dobbins, who became our Ambassador to the OECD and is now in the NSC, was there;
                    Brunson McKinley, who later became our Ambassador to Haiti, was there; Peter
                    Sommer, who was a DoD civilian, later became our Ambassador to Malta; Gib
                    Lanpher became our Ambassador to Zimbabwe, covered Africa; April Glaspie, later
                    Ambassador to Iraq, covered the Middle East. So we had a pretty impressive group
                    of people.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The political situation in the UK had changed considerably from the days when a
                    Labor government—Jim Callaghan—had been in power. Now the Tories, in the person
                    of Margaret Thatcher, were in charge. The expectations were that Labor would
                    take control again—probably relatively soon. The last election had been close.
                    The sentiment for unilateral disarmament was strong and growing and that was
                    Labor's issue. The basing of cruise missiles in Europe was coming to a head with
                    the UK being one of the countries in which this would be based. In order for the
                    program to go forward—and it was one of the cornerstones of the defense
                    strategy—required a critical mass of European participation with the UK being a
                    pivotal country.</p>
                <p>There was some concern in the Embassy that a future Labor government might well
                    withdraw its support for the basing of US intermediate range missiles, under
                    NATO, on British soil. The party remained divided on the issue. There was a
                    strong unilateral and pacifist sentiment among party cadres. However, David
                    Steele, who later defected from the Labor Party to form the Social Democrats
                    Party, was the defense spokesman, and he certainly did not favor unilateral
                    disarmament. But there were many in the Party who were, particularly the left
                    wing which was strongly linked to the labor unions.</p>
                <p>The domestic debate on this issue really revolved around the basing of the
                    ground-launched cruise missiles and the question of whether to proceed with a
                    new generation of the British independent nuclear weapon capability—a submarine
                    system and a missile capability. There were also questions about the basing of
                    US nuclear capable submarines. So the general debate about the UK's position on
                    defense strategy was very important to us; we had a large stake in the outcome.
                    The debate within the Labor Party was very vigorous and made my job most
                    interesting. One of my assignments was to make sure that the Labor Party
                    understood our position on defense issues, not only to try to explain our
                    policies but also to expose Labor MPs more broadly to defense issues, which can
                    be very intricate and complex.</p>
                <p>My approach was mainly through individual members of Parliament. I would see them
                    privately; I would attend Labor Party conventions. I developed many personal
                    relationships with individual Labor MPs. During my tour, I think I had contact
                    with almost every Labor MP and established personal relationships with many. I
                    tried to put some of them in touch with other members of our Embassy and
                    introduced some to officials of our government including visiting Congressmen.
                    This was intended to expose those MPs to a wider cross section of views, many of
                    which were shared by our people—as a government we are far from monolithic. That
                    was fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Some observers might question the need for such a large Political Section for a
                    friendly country, completely democratic and open with a free and unfettered
                    press. That debate was going on when I was in London and persists today. The
                    question is whether with CNN and other media outlets so active, is all the
                    diplomatic reporting required? In some respects, this question misses the mark
                    because the Political Section in London was not simply a reporting unit, it was
                    very much policy oriented, focusing on areas of US concern across the board.
                    London, like all of our major posts—Paris, Bonn, Rome, Tokyo—have a much larger
                    function than the conduct of bilateral relations. They devote much time to
                    tracking and exploring what is going on in their host countries on issues of
                    vital concern to our government. An indication of that was the staffing of the
                    London Political Section which had, for example, an African expert—this was the
                    time of the Lancaster House discussions on the future of Rhodesia, soon to
                    become Zimbabwe. Latin America was of some importance at the time, with Grenada,
                    a former British possession, heating up. Most of the leaders in Grenada had been
                    educated in the UK, giving that island continuing ties to Great Britain. The
                    Middle East has always ranked very high on the British foreign policy agenda as
                    well as ours; many meetings on issues in that region took place in London. We
                    had a Middle East expert in the Section as well.</p>
                <p>We did have bilateral issues of importance—on the European Community for example
                    where the British then and now have a continuing debate internally on the degree
                    and depth of their association with Europe will be. They still have more of the
                    same reservations today than they had in my time. The Bank of England played a
                    heavy role in financial circles—even more then than today. So we had a broad
                    range of issues that had to be discussed with the British. If the London
                    Political Section was doing its job well, it was covering all of those issues of
                    vital importance to the US.</p>
                <p>There are of course many other means of communications between the two
                    governments besides communication through diplomatic establishments. But these
                    means are not really a substitute for direct, continuing contacts between
                    representatives of the two governments. A staff living locally is better able to
                    report continually on issues of interest, can prepare for visits to ensure they
                    are as useful as possible and can integrate specific events or issues into the
                    larger context of our relationship and interests. An embassy is in a very good
                    position to pull these various aspects together into a more meaningful over-all
                    picture in part because very often the same people in the government or in
                    Parliament are involved in many of these issues as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Let me mention briefly some of my reactions to the Labor Party. Some people have
                    viewed its members as a collection of trade unionists and leftists, all joining
                    together to sing “The Red Flag Forever,” viscerally responding negatively to
                    anything that smacked of a free market economy—and America—holding an affinity
                    for collectivist government. That is a caricature and an unfair
                    characterization. There were some people in the Labor Party that might be
                    described that way, but the Party represented a broad spectrum of British
                    society. On the far left, it included the “Tribune Group” and people like Arthur
                    Scargill—the head of the mine workers—and others who were certainly anti free
                    enterprise and sympathetic to the communists. At the same time, there were many
                    others—the vast majority—who were much more balanced in their views.</p>
                <p>The Labor Party originated when an ideological split occurred in the orthodox
                    socialist and Marxist parties. The hope was that this new party would be able to
                    achieve a socialist society—balancing individualism and communitarianism—through
                    democratic means. There were many philosophical strains represented in the
                    British Labor Party; but support for democracy was the thread which held them
                    together. There were some authoritarian views expressed while I followed the
                    Party; a major issue was whether the Party should remain the voice and
                    instrument of the trade union movement or whether it should strive to be
                    something larger. Increasingly, economic development and political necessities
                    answered that question; the Labor Party, to return to power, would have to have
                    a broader constituency than the trade union movement. The British unions, as
                    their American counterparts, have declined in membership. A party that was an
                    exclusive trade union party would not have prospered at the polls; that was the
                    key factor which eventually drove the Labor Party to seek a truly national
                    constituency.</p>
                <p>It was apparent then, and became clearer subsequently, that the Labor Party could
                    not afford to remain in lock-step with the big unions. The people who had
                    dominated the Party—and perhaps even a majority of the members—really didn't
                    want to change to a broad-based institution. They preferred to control the
                    Party—even if small—rather than giving up some of their powers and beliefs in
                    the competitive process of competing for national leadership. That was the
                    essence of the debate.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, there were a few left wing militant members of the Party who were
                    essentially authoritarian—the “Tribune Group.” They considered themselves to be
                    a vanguard group within the Labor Party and British society; they would lead
                    their “brothers” to the promised land. They envisioned the UK becoming a Marxist
                    society. I talked to them often and even debated them. I became fairly well
                    known among the Labor Party members; so I would often be singled out when I
                    attended Labor gatherings. Arthur Scargill, a former communist, engaged me on
                    several occasions in open debate about such things as US visa issuance
                    policies—he was on the “watch list,” and could only come to the U.S. with a
                    waiver. He resented this, and would periodically raise it publicly as an example
                    of US intolerance; I would be called on to refute his allegations.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I also covered the Socialist International. Its executive secretary, Brent
                    Carlsson, was based in London. That was an additional responsibility which at
                    times was quite time consuming. Carlsson was Swedish. The International and
                    others were becoming more active in Central America and were serious critics of
                    US policy. One of its vice-presidents was Salvadoran; he also resided in London.
                    The Labor Party also became interested in Central America. That became a time
                    consuming brief.</p>
                <p>The Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan called into question some of the
                    genuflecting responses of Labor's left. They eventually came up with a new
                    rationale: all super-powers were the same—we were all imperialists who acted the
                    same way—”a plague on all of you.”</p>
                <p>While I was in London, Anastasio Somoza was deposed by the Sandinistas in
                    Nicaragua. There was an affinity between the Sandinistas and the socialists. I
                    would go to the annual Labor Party conferences, which were major political
                    events, as were the conventions of the other British parties. The most
                    interesting aspects of these conferences were not the speeches and activities on
                    the floor, but the side events. Groups would reserve hotel rooms and lobby the
                    delegates to support their points of view. They would invite delegates and
                    observers and the public, to meetings outside the conference hall. I would go
                    from meeting to meeting listening to all possible views. The Central American
                    faction—including the Sandinistas and various groups on the left—would hold
                    forth. Sandinista leaders as well as people from Grenada, Salvador, and
                    Guatemala were all there. There were groups at these conferences from all parts
                    of the world. It was quite interesting.</p>
                <p>There was some concern in the Embassy about the future directions of the UK.
                    Devolution was a subject of major public debate as were the various economic
                    difficulties that the UK was facing. The issue of Northern Ireland was very much
                    alive as it is today. Scottish nationalism raised its head periodically. The
                    United Kingdom at times did not seem to be very united. The independence of
                    Wales was less of a factor, in part because that part of the UK was well
                    represented in the upper councils of the Labor Party—Party leader Michael Foote
                    and his heir apparent Neil Kinnock. The Scots were also well represented within
                    the Party, but pro-independence sentiment was prospering—to a large extent, at
                    the expense of the Labor Party. In fact, the Scottish Nationalist Party was
                    largely formed by defectors from the British Labor Party. The England-based
                    Conservative Party majority in the House of Commons was mirrored by a solid
                    majority of the Labor Party in both Scotland and Wales.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>As I said, there was vigorous debate in Great Britain about the economic
                    direction of the country. The conservative view was quite clear: the previous
                    Labor Government was responsible for the drag on the economy; there needed to be
                    a significant re-direction of the economy which would undoubtedly entail much
                    pain for the people. While I was there, the unemployment rate was growing,
                    running counter to the traditional trends in Europe where the consequences of
                    unemployment in any case were cushioned by a large social net and extensive
                    welfare programs. The question of who would pay for these programs was very much
                    on people's minds.</p>
                <p>The Conservative Party was achieving some success in its efforts to reorient the
                    economy. It was clear that the majority of Britishers supported its policies.
                    Many of the Conservative views coincided with those of our government while
                    Labor policies on such issues as defense were quite different. The Embassy held
                    that there were no fundamental issues that divided the U.S. from either the
                    Labor or Liberal Parties. They were democratic parties and the differences
                    between us were clearly within acceptable limits.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned that Kingman Brewster was our Ambassador during most of my
                    assignment in London. He was an impressive man. He relied heavily on his DCM, Ed
                    Streator, and his staff. Ed managed the Embassy and did most of the recruiting.
                    Brewster had excellent relations with the top levels of the British government
                    and other parts of society. He made real efforts to establish a dialogue with
                    the Labor Party—a classical Liberal, he had an affinity for many of the policies
                    espoused by the Labor Party—except for unilateralism and some other defense
                    related issues. He had been shaped by WWII and strongly supported a united
                    Europe. He believed that the close relationship between the UK and the U.S. and
                    between the U.S. and Europe was and should remain—the foundation of US policy.
                    He very much supported the solidarity of the Western alliance, which he hoped to
                    reinvigorate. He was convinced that “right reason” would prevail if the story
                    could only be disseminated; given the facts, people would rally around this
                    concept of unity. He was often perplexed that right reason was not adequately
                    disseminated or did not prevail—particularly with the Labor left.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Northern Ireland was on our agenda. We continued to do the things that we had
                    done consistently. We were looking for the solutions to this very vexing
                    problem—a sectarian dispute that had defied reason. There had been so much blood
                    spilled and so much history had flowed among the protagonists that the dispute
                    seemed irreconcilable. Although I didn't have direct responsibility for the
                    Northern Ireland, I did talk to people who were following the issue closely.
                    They were frustrated; it seemed so intractable. The British seemed committed to
                    finding a way out; many distinguished people had literally given their lives to
                    trying to find a solution. Hundreds of people were being killed each year,
                    either by bombs or shootings or other terrorist acts—in Great Britain and in
                    Northern Ireland. Some people would shake their heads and decry the deaths, but
                    would maintain that a solution imposed on the parties would only result in open
                    civil war with the loss of many, many more lives. So the loss of life then
                    occurring, according to this point of view, was still at a relatively low level
                    and in light of the alternative, still acceptable. I didn't necessarily agree
                    with this view, but it was frequently expressed.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, there were significant efforts made to find solutions. One
                    suggestion was to try to dangle an economic incentive before the combatants,
                    giving all the protagonists an opportunity to improve their standards of living
                    if they could find a political settlement—something akin to what today are known
                    as “enterprise zones” where US manufacturers and others would invest in Northern
                    Ireland in return for tax breaks and other official inducements. The sectarian
                    nature of the struggle was reflected in the work place. They would be either all
                    Catholic or all Protestant. Since the government in Belfast was controlled by
                    the Protestant majority, most of the work places were similarly controlled. It
                    was very hard to find political accommodations when every aspect of daily life
                    is compartmentalized along sectarian lines, which reinforced division rather
                    than building bridges of understanding. So while many were actively looking for
                    solutions, progress was glacial.</p>
                <p>I was in London when administrations changed in Washington. There were a number
                    of people in the UK—particularly those on the left—who viewed President Reagan
                    through the prism of his movies and thought of him as something of a “right wing
                    kook.” But many Britishers, accustomed to civil service governance as well as
                    the prominent role played by graduates of “public” schools, viewed events in the
                    U.S. as the natural result of the management of affairs by the “ruling” class.
                    So whatever they thought about Ronald Reagan, they were more interested in
                    determining who in the U.S. was responsible for policy initiatives. If those
                    people were thought to be competent, then the British were reassured—regardless
                    of who occupied the White House. I think that view was probably more prevalent
                    in the Conservative Party, partly because they were the government and Labor was
                    the opposition. Our role was mainly to explain policies, and not to probe the
                    predilections of individuals within the U.S. government. We might hear
                    criticisms of a particular policy and then perhaps a condemnation of the
                    President, but the first focus was on the policy not the chief executive. I did
                    establish a fruitful, if at times frustrating, dialogue with Labor members on
                    the policies of the new administration; they were often critical, whether it was
                    Grenada, Central America, or defense questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Grenada was an interesting issue because the island was in an area in which the
                    British had an interest and knew something about. They had strong diplomatic,
                    cultural, and political ties in the region. We attempted to work closely with
                    the British as the situation evolved. Early on, we formed consultative groups. A
                    number of senior Washington officials were named to coordinate with the
                    British—most prominent among them was Phil Habib, who came to London to conduct
                    periodic discussions. Since I was the Embassy's “expert” on Latin America, I
                    participated in those discussions and generally provided staff support to
                    Ambassador Habib. We were trying to coordinate our view points; we and the
                    British were not entirely on the same wave length. The British were reluctant to
                    become over-involved. Many of the Grenada leaders had been British educated.
                    Grenada's High Commissioner-designate (Ambassador) to the UK was a resident
                    solicitor, and the British were reluctant to accredit him, but eventually did
                    so. The British view was that the situation in Grenada, after the
                    mini-revolution, though distasteful, would just have to be accepted. Our view
                    was that the situation in Grenada was serious and that more forceful response
                    was called for to protect the region against Cuban-supported subversion or worse
                    from Grenada. The British were much more passive, assuming that this problem
                    would eventually dissipate.</p>
                <p>I had developed a fairly close relationship with the new Grenada High
                    Commissioner through Labor Party associations. He was an engaging personality.
                    He would try to convince me of the error of our ways, and I would try to
                    convince him that he was serving bad masters. I would report our conversations
                    to Washington—he knew that I was doing that and was probably the reason he
                    talked to me. As events unfolded, he conveyed a sense of disagreement and
                    disillusion among his country's leaders. I reported what he said, but I had the
                    feeling that Washington was not listening. Apparently, Washington had made up
                    its mind about what had to be done in Grenada; signs of flexibility in the New
                    Jewel Movement were not in the script. So my reports may not have been welcomed
                    by all.</p>
                <p>There was little enthusiasm in Labor circles for our military actions. Grenada
                    was a tiny speck and did not attract much British interest, particularly after
                    the invasion which took place without British participation. We had been in
                    touch with the British High Commissioner in Grenada who was a distinguished
                    figure in his own right. He had certain residual authority and when our military
                    went in, he had some residual legal authorities by virtue of his position to
                    make decisions without reference to other authority. Therefore he was a
                    protagonist of some significance when we landed. Before then, we had warned him
                    that the situation of the American students—about 600—at the Grenada medical
                    school was becoming untenable.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The British understood our concern about Grenada, but many Foreign Officers had
                    some misgivings, particularly since we had moved forward in concert with East
                    Caribbean governments and not with the UK. Some of the people involved had
                    prickly personalities. For example, in the Foreign Office, Latin America was the
                    responsibility of a senior Tory MP, who was later sacked following some
                    intemperate remarks about Europe and Germans in particular. He was close to
                    Margaret Thatcher. This gentleman was prone to state his views in an
                    off-the-cuff manner, with considerable bite. He was not enthralled by our
                    actions in Grenada—as he told me several times in his own inimitable fashion. So
                    I had considerable fence-mending to do in the Foreign Office after the Grenada
                    passions had died down.</p>
                <p>During my tour, we had a change in ambassadors. John Lewis followed Kingman
                    Brewster. Lewis had very limited experience in foreign affairs. Brewster had
                    been a distinguished public figure as the President of Yale University with long
                    standing connections with the UK and with Europe—from his days working with the
                    Marshall Plan. John Lewis had no such background; he came from the family that
                    owned and ran the Johnson Wax Company. He was a nice man, but did not cover
                    himself with glory as ambassador. The British establishment has a way of
                    destroying people; they did a pretty good job on Lewis. I think if the truth be
                    known, that “inner circle” had a role in the Ambassador's early replacement.
                    They wanted someone of substance and someone who had the President's ear. They
                    became convinced that Lewis was a lightweight with little access to the Oval
                    Office—and therefore wanted another ambassador.</p>
                <p>Lewis' early departure was precipitated by the Falklands War. He was on vacation
                    in the U.S. when Argentina and the UK came to blows over the islands. I was told
                    that he called the Embassy and said that he had read about events and wondered
                    whether he should return to London. The Charge told him that everything was
                    under control and that there was no need to cut short his vacation. So he didn't
                    and soon thereafter was replaced—a victim of inexperience and bad advice.</p>
                <p>The Falklands episode was a very difficult period for us. The Foreign Office
                    initially was not on top of events, just as the British government was not. So
                    as the situation evolved, there was a lot of embarrassment. The early stages
                    were characterized by an atmosphere of recrimination which was just below the
                    surface of relationships. Some wondered how the whole incident got started—the
                    signs were misread by the British, and the situation threatened to immobilize by
                    mounting recriminations. As matters evolved and the situation became a military
                    problem, the tendency to worry about who was at fault dissipated; that was very
                    fortunate for the British officials responsible for management of Falklands'
                    policy. The Foreign Secretary resigned, although he was not directly responsible
                    for the miscalculation of Argentine intent. He took the blame because that was
                    what was expected of senior officials under the British form of government—if
                    there is a major problem, the Cabinet officer presumably responsible takes the
                    fall, whether or not he or she had anything to do with that problem. In this
                    case, the Foreign Secretary was broadly applauded for his action; I think it
                    would be interesting if that pattern of behavior were followed in Washington;
                    would be refreshing—but it would never happen in the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Latin America was my area of responsibility although it was not my major
                    responsibility. So I followed the Falklands story. One of the British decisions
                    that might have encouraged Argentine miscalculation was to change the schedule
                    for their supply ships calling at the islands. This was misread in Buenos Aires
                    as a signal that the UK was not prepared to defend its interests in the
                    Falklands. The Argentine government was thereby encouraged to believe it could
                    act with impunity. The British Foreign Office could have been seriously
                    criticized for going along with this rescheduling. I reported this but never got
                    any reaction from Washington. I left London before the outbreak of hostility and
                    followed events from my next post in Uruguay where the Falklands were also an
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left London in 1982 and were assigned to Uruguay as
                        DCM. You served there for three years. So you arrived in Montevideo at the
                        height of the Falkland/Malvinas dispute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: Right. Uruguay is a very small country—3 million plus inhabitants. It has
                    a livestock-based economy. It has a very close relationship—love/hate—with
                    Argentina. Uruguay was created as a buffer state out of the rivalry between
                    Brazil and Argentina which continues. Uruguay's affinity was much more with
                    Argentina, but this relationship is always on a roller-coaster.</p>
                <p>The Argentine Ambassador, representing a military dictatorship, was an admiral,
                    notorious for his authoritarian outspoken demeanor. He had a single view of the
                    Falklands dispute—that of the military regime. He was prepared to regale one and
                    all with his views at diplomatic receptions given the slightest opportunity. He
                    also had very negative views of the US, which he also used to express to any one
                    who would listen.</p>
                <p>My Ambassador was Tom Aranda, a non-career official, who had been on the White
                    House political staff. He was a lawyer from Arizona who had been active in
                    politics there. He spoke fluent Spanish and had some connections with Mexico.
                    His principal asset was good Spanish; when his capabilities were tested, he
                    scored 5/4+; he was incensed that he did not also score 5 in reading
                    comprehension. In any case, he had strong views on all subjects. He also had a
                    short-term photographic memory; he could look at several pages for a few minutes
                    and then repeat virtually verbatim all that he had read. That was very useful in
                    using talking points for meetings or public appearances; you could be sure that
                    he would deliver them down to the last period.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I think the reason I got the DCM job was because of the transition that was
                    taking place at the time in Uruguay's political world—from military rule to a
                    more democratic regime. My background in London on the Falklands issue made me
                    somewhat suspect, but on balance was a plus. Uruguay at the time was in the
                    final stage of preparing for an election which would return a civilian-led
                    democratic government following the era of Tupamaro violence and military
                    governments—bad times. I had some experience in countries going through
                    transitions—Portugal and the Dominican Republic, to some extent, and this I
                    suspect counted with those making the selection.</p>
                <p>One of my main challenges in the Embassy turned out to be internal management. It
                    was a heavy burden. The Ambassador was not the easiest person to work with and
                    his relationships with the national employees was often strained. Later, as a
                    member of the Inspection Corps, I learned more about such problems—managing
                    overseas establishments, the role of the chief of mission, morale questions and
                    their relationship to the effectiveness of a mission. So my Uruguay experience
                    turned out to be quite valuable in my subsequent work as an inspector. But it
                    was experience that was hard won.</p>
                <p>In Uruguay, the national employees had a difficult time adjusting to the new
                    Ambassador as did the Ambassador in becoming accustomed to a different work
                    environment from the one to which he was accustomed. An embassy is highly
                    structured with agency representatives working with an established cadre of
                    national employees who provide continuity and expertise in specialized areas.
                    These employees are valuable assets; the idea is to get all elements of the
                    mission, including the national employees, to work together in pursuit of US
                    objectives. Generally, that happens but it is by no means a given.</p>
                <p>Another way of looking at national employees—a perverse view—is to see them as
                    somehow the authority of the chief of mission. People who represent continuity,
                    according to this view, tend to see continuity in terms of rules and procedures
                    and previous patterns of behavior. New people coming in who want to establish
                    their authority, particularly if they come from an environment where personal
                    loyalty is a primary virtue and perhaps more important than established
                    patterns, can feel challenged by people who assert the dominance of rules and
                    precedent over personal authority. That happened in Uruguay and was one of the
                    core issues that raised tensions between the Ambassador and the local
                    employees.</p>
                <p>The same problem, but to a lesser extent, clouded relationships between the
                    agency representatives and the chief of mission. Agency heads have some
                    authority, but clearly the chief of mission has overall authority. Normally, a
                    mission operates most effectively when agency representatives and the chief of
                    mission have an understanding arrived at through discussion and a deliberative
                    process in which all accept that the ambassador has ultimate responsibility for
                    operations of the mission; it is important that the sections chiefs and the
                    ambassador have a mutual respect. This makes for the most effective missions.
                    Unfortunately this environment did not always exist in Uruguay.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The role of the DCM in situation of tensions between the ambassador and the
                    embassy staff, both American and national, is a delicate one. The DCM attempts
                    to bridge the differences and keep the mission moving forward in the most
                    efficient manner possible in pursuit of US objectives. Generally speaking, I
                    think I managed to do that, although there were some tense moments when
                    personality clashes and egos threatened the accomplishments of the mission's
                    objectives. Most of these conflicts were kept within bounds, but it was an
                    educational experience; it was tough, but very worthwhile.</p>
                <p>Through it all, my relations with the Ambassador were generally good. He had
                    little confidence in the “bureaucracy.” He viewed loyalties as personal—i.e. to
                    him. I am not sure that he would agree with this characterization, but I think
                    this tendency was one of the real problems. He agreed to my assignment, based on
                    the strong support I received from the senior Deputy Assistant Secretary in ARA,
                    with whom I had worked with in London. Ambassador Aranda probably would have
                    preferred someone he selected, who would be personally loyal to him. So there
                    was some initial tension, in general, the Ambassador viewed all staff members in
                    that light—that is unless they owed some personal loyalty and allegiance to him,
                    they were suspect and had to prove themselves. That is not the approach most
                    career officers would take on relationships; in fact, that is not the way
                    relationships are established in the Foreign Service; it is a career service and
                    people perform in a professional manner and that extends to national employees
                    as well. Ambassador Aranda, going against the Foreign Service culture—and at
                    times sound management practices—was not really getting the most out of his
                    staff and that was the problem. My job was to try to bridge those differences; I
                    tried to get him to adjust his view of the staff to give them the benefit of any
                    doubts he might have and to operate less on the basis of personalities. I had
                    mixed success with my efforts. Overall, however, I think the tensions were kept
                    within tolerable limits and the mission's overall accomplishments were
                    impressive.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Let me return to the Falklands/Malvinas issue. Uruguay, as I mentioned, has a
                    certain schizophrenia about Argentina. Uruguay has a long history of Argentine
                    as well as British involvement from its earliest days. There was a substantial
                    British community in Uruguay—as there was in Argentina. The British were
                    fortunate to have an effective High Commissioner in Montevideo. I think the
                    British Foreign Office was pleasantly surprised by their High Commissioner's
                    performance. Prior to the crisis, Montevideo was viewed in London as more of a
                    reward for faithful service than as a training ground for the up-and-coming. The
                    Falklands changed all that. The British High Commissioner, who I came to know
                    well, was a courageous woman and a wise diplomat and stood up under the
                    pressure. She represented the UK very well, particularly when compared to the
                    Argentinian Ambassador I described earlier. In Uruguay, the government was run
                    by the military. The civilian political leadership, who may have differed on
                    certain policies, were totally united in their distaste for the military regime.
                    So most of the political dialogue was with the civilians—the political elites of
                    the two parties: Blancos and Colorados who all supported a speedy return to
                    democratic government. The fact that Argentina was ruled by an authoritarian
                    regime was probably the greatest liability it had to carry—certainly in Latin
                    America and probably generally. It would have had greater support for its action
                    against the British if the government were of a different stripe; as it was, any
                    action that the Argentinian government took was suspect. Certainly the invasion
                    of the Islands was questioned as a reasonable action. So whatever anti-colonial
                    legitimacy the Argentinian regime might have asserted was pretty much dismissed
                    because of its authoritarian origins and its bumbling behavior.</p>
                <p>Uruguay was important to the UK in a strategic sense because, particularly at the
                    beginning of the crisis, its supply lines were very tenuous; it had a great deal
                    of difficulty in re-supplying its forces on the Falklands. The British were
                    anxious to find a safe and efficient avenue to evacuate some of the more
                    critical medical cases by air; so they needed landing rights and access to ports
                    somewhere on the continent. So early on, by relying on historical ties, they
                    were able to land their planes in Uruguay. But as Argentine pressures increased
                    on the Uruguayans, those landing rights were terminated and port facilities were
                    denied to the British. But by and large the Uruguayans did maintain as even
                    handed approach as possible, although toward the later stages, as I have
                    suggested, they were forced to tilt toward Argentina. The role of the British
                    High Commissioner was an important factor in keeping Uruguay to a balanced
                    policy; our role was initially to find some accommodation between the feuding
                    parties, with Secretary Haig's personal involvement. Eventually we came down on
                    the side of the UK. In retrospect, and even at the time, there was no question
                    in my mind that we would support Great Britain.</p>

                <p>I remember that during the tensest moment, a friend from London—Hugh
                    O'Shaughnessy of the Financial Times—came through Montevideo. He had obtained a
                    visa to enter Argentina using his Irish passport and his Irish name. After he
                    had filed his stories from Buenos Aires, he left Argentina for a few days rest
                    in Uruguay. I invited him to stay with me, which he did. He told me that he was
                    quite surprised by the U.S. position, he had read the press and expected us to
                    support Argentina. I asked him how he could ever come to that conclusion. He
                    finally acknowledged that he had been quite wrong. But I must say that these
                    events took place early in the Reagan administration which included voices that
                    in the early days of the crisis, appeared to support Argentina. In the early
                    stages, we did try to find a formula for settlement; if you are going to be a
                    mediator, you have to adopt an even-handed approach, and that stance might have
                    misled some observers into believing we would eventually back Argentina.</p>
                <p>Our decision to back the UK led in Montevideo to several shouting sessions with
                    the Argentinian Ambassador who counted us among the “war criminals.” In fact, it
                    was he who was later indicted as a criminal and placed in prison in Buenos Aires
                    for his torture of Argentine political prisoners. The rising level of tensions
                    over the Falklands/Malvinas led to the evacuation of a large contingent of the
                    American Embassy staff from Buenos Aires. Montevideo was designated “safe
                    haven;” so initially that staff came to Montevideo by ferry and over land; they
                    stayed in Montevideo for some weeks before returning to Buenos Aires. That led
                    to considerable confusion because, under emergency evacuation procedures, the
                    clear expectation is that the designated “safe haven” is essentially a stop over
                    place for an onward trip home or to another more secure “safe haven.” The idea
                    was that people would come to Montevideo first and then move on. I learned
                    subsequently that an understanding had been reached between our Ambassador in
                    Buenos Aires and the Department. He had no intention of sending his people home;
                    he merely wanted to take some action to ease any morale problems at post and
                    address concerns in Washington. So under the guise of sending them to a “safe
                    haven,” he sent certain staff members and their families to Montevideo for a
                    period of time; he had no intention for them to go any farther, established
                    evacuation procedures notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>But we at Embassy Montevideo were operating on a different assumption; we
                    expected the BA staff to move on after a few days in Uruguay. We had reports
                    that showed that members of the Argentine intelligence services were active in
                    Montevideo; that created a threat to the Americans from Buenos Aires that we had
                    to take seriously. We imposed certain restrictions on the evacuees; they were
                    not happy with that decision. Some of them seemed to anticipate little more than
                    a shopping spree in Montevideo at US government expense; they fully expected to
                    return to BA shortly. So we had some problems in managing the visitors but it
                    ended happily, with their eventual return to Argentina.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Pressures were placed on the Foreign Ministry by the Uruguayan military who were
                    the closest friends the Argentine government had in Montevideo. Uruguay had some
                    very good diplomats, but they found it increasingly difficult to maintain an
                    even-handed policy. Eventually, we began to see a shift toward Argentina. For
                    example, the head of our Political Section was declared persona non grata; the
                    Ambassador was called in by the Foreign Ministry to be advised that this
                    individual was being expelled because he had allegedly made some comments that
                    were deemed by a senior Uruguayan military officer to be unacceptable
                    interference in the domestic affairs of Uruguay; i.e. Uruguay's position
                    vis-a-vis Argentina. The alleged offense took place at a diplomatic reception
                    where Argentinians and senior Uruguayan naval officers were present. The latter
                    brought the allegations to the attention of the Foreign Ministry, pressing for
                    action against the embassy officer. We interpreted this action as a signal that
                    Uruguay was moving to the Argentina camp. In part, the action reflected a shift
                    in the environment as the war continued; the Uruguayans were under increasing
                    pressure to support their large neighbor and to oppose the UK.</p>
                <p>We had a debate in the Embassy on what our response should be to the Uruguayan
                    action. There were some proposals made which I viewed as unwise and some which
                    were down right foolish. I counseled strongly against those and managed to stop
                    them. The options considered ranged from ignoring the expulsion; to taking
                    action—not without risk to sources and methods—to disprove the allegations; to
                    responding in kind. In the end, we recommended that a person of equal rank to
                    our section chief in the Uruguayan Embassy in Washington be expelled; that is
                    what happened. The whole episode was unprecedented; the Uruguayans seemed to be
                    seriously alarmed by our reaction. I must say that not everyone in the Embassy
                    favored this course of action; there were some self serving arguments made. I
                    think we did the right thing; we certainly could not have ignored the Uruguayan
                    action and our response was measured and appropriate.</p>
                <p>Ironically, we expelled a diplomat whose views were very much pro-American. But
                    he was the logical choice given his position. We managed to maintain a very good
                    relationship with that Uruguayan diplomat when he returned to Montevideo
                    although he was not very happy by the disruption we caused his family life. We
                    gave the American officer who had been expelled a meritorious honor award in a
                    very public ceremony prior to his departure to underscore that we considered him
                    to be blameless. Then we had a farewell reception at the airport when he
                    left—that was widely reported in the media.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the Falklands/Malvinas episode came to an end and our relationships
                    with Uruguay returned to their even keel. We then could focus again on the major
                    issue in Uruguay: the transition from a military authoritarian regime to a
                    democratic one.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The transition took place during my tour. The student-led violence which led to a
                    military takeover in Uruguay occurred at about the same time as similar
                    movements around the world—e.g. the violence in Germany (Rudy the Red and the
                    Bader-Meinhof group). Uruguay is a very European oriented country. The events in
                    Germany and elsewhere in Europe made a deep impression in Uruguay, particularly
                    among the students—the sons and daughters of the elites were the most active in
                    the Tupamaro movement. The Uruguayan economy is live-stock based; but society is
                    urban centered. Building on European socialist models, Uruguay became the first
                    Latin American welfare state. A booming cattle economy supported social indices
                    more frequently associated with northern Europe—high education and literacy
                    levels, long life expectancy, the highest per capita meat consumption in the
                    world, high social expectations. Expectations rise as the economy expands; when
                    a down turn follows with expectations still high, political trouble is
                    frequently the consequence. Uruguay's political system was simply overwhelmed.
                    The politicians, unable to cope with the violence, invited the military in. The
                    regime responded by restricting political discourse and tightening control. That
                    is the opposite of what should have happened and resulted in an explosion. The
                    dissidents, instead of being accommodated within the system, went underground
                    and turned to violence; the political elites panicked and turned to the
                    military, which took repressive actions. This era was marked by the murder of an
                    American public safety advisor, Dan Mitrione. He was kidnaped by the Tupamaros
                    and eventually murdered.</p>
                <p>The military was still in power when I arrived in Montevideo. The Tupamaros had
                    been defeated and essentially eliminated as a viable force by the military at
                    heavy cost both in lives and to the social fabric of the country. The country
                    was gradually knitting back together; the political elites had essentially
                    turned power over to the military. But now they wanted it back. The country was
                    looking for a formula which allow the civilian political leaders and the
                    military to live together in a democratic system. This was not an unfamiliar
                    situation; many countries have successfully managed similar transitions. In the
                    final analysis, an agreement was struck between the political parties and the
                    military on the terms of a transition which would take place gradually following
                    democratic elections. This process was underway while I was in Montevideo, and,
                    despite a number of bumps on the road, a democratic-elected President took power
                    in 1985.</p>
                <p>The Argentine situation was a threat to the transition because in Uruguay it
                    tended to increase the pressure for the continuation of authoritarian rule. That
                    translated into the possibility of an interruption in the transition process.
                    The collapse of the military regime in Buenos Aires following the Falklands war
                    was viewed with some reservation by the Uruguayan military; it tempted them to
                    consider not withdrawing from power because of the concern that the Uruguayan
                    military would be held in the same contempt as their Argentine brothers after
                    the inauguration of a civilian government. On the other hand, the fall of the
                    Argentinian junta was welcomed in Uruguayan political circles.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>We were very much committed to the transition. We had very good contacts with all
                    levels and segments of society, including the military. We used those contacts
                    to make it eminently clear what our position was; we wanted the transition to
                    move forward without delay. As we neared elections, there were issues between
                    the two competing political parties; one or the other felt disadvantages by the
                    drift of events and one or the other was tempted to push for a delay or a change
                    in the previously agreed rules governing the transition. A bargain had been
                    struck at the beginning that we supported even though it may not have been the
                    bargain of the process that might have been struck following the relative
                    decline of the military's rule. But we recognized that any attempt to change any
                    part of the deal might well have meant a complete renegotiation which might have
                    ended in no deal at all and a prolongation of military rule. So we insisted that
                    all parties kept the final goal in mind and that the disagreements that arose
                    during the transition be settled without disrupting the transition timetable. We
                    were at this point within striking distance of the final goal; as we got closer
                    to it, the parties, seeking tactical advantage, raised objections, as I have
                    suggested. So we held extensive conversations with party and military leaders
                    trying to keep the transition on track.</p>
                <p>I think our policy had always been clear—namely that we were supporting a
                    transition to democratic government. The views of some members of the Reagan
                    administration were welcomed by the Uruguayan military—e.g. Kirkpatrick's
                    philosophical treatise on the differences between dictatorships and
                    authoritarian regimes which gave considerable credit to the policies of some
                    military regimes. These views, despite self-serving interpretation by Uruguay's
                    military apologists may have been helpful to us because they tended to reassure
                    the military. I don't think Ms. Kirkpatrick disagreed at all with our policy in
                    Uruguay; she made the point that change at least was possible under a military
                    regime. Democracy was always the goal. Change and democracy were precisely what
                    we were supporting in Uruguay.</p>
                <p>Human rights was still a concern. The transition process included the issue of
                    the treatment of certain political prisoners; their rights had been violated in
                    the past, although many of these people had clearly committed crimes and were
                    not imprisoned solely or perhaps even primarily because of their political
                    views. Nevertheless, their treatment in prison was an issue. A number of these
                    individuals had been tortured; the evidence of that was clear. We successfully
                    maintained the most extensive index of prisoners in Uruguay; we made it known to
                    the authorities that we had such a list. That reinforced the pressure to deal
                    humanely with those in custody and to comply with the terms of the political
                    agreements which included provisions for the release of most of the prisoners.
                    We were very conscious of abuses that had occurred. We took a very strong stand
                    on human rights abuses.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Uruguay did not take a major interest in events in Central America. It was far
                    away and was considered diversion. The Argentine military had played a nefarious
                    role early on, particularly in El Salvador. But the Uruguayans saw Central
                    America as a far distant area of no great interest or concern to them. Uruguay's
                    diplomatic tradition was to focus on those places where it might find a niche
                    for itself—where did its diplomacy have a comparative advantage? Returning to
                    the social indices that I mentioned earlier, Uruguay produced a number of
                    outstanding world citizens and diplomats far greater than its population might
                    suggest. One of Uruguay's major exports was these citizens; many of them held
                    leadership positions in international organizations. Uruguay also became a
                    center for international meetings—e.g. Punta del Este, a Uruguayan resort was
                    the site where the Alliance for Progress was launched in the 1960s. Uruguay has
                    consistently produced important figures for the world stage. So it tends to look
                    at issues from a global perspective and for the potential for a Uruguayan
                    arbitration or mediation role.</p>
                <p>Uruguay is a small country, but my assignment there was especially rewarding. It
                    is a very special place. The history of Uruguay is unique in the region; the
                    development of its two-party system is instructive, going back to the early part
                    of the 1900s. The political tradition is basically European, with an overlay of
                    the modern American system. Some of the people who rose in prominence in
                    politics while I was there are still very active today. We got to know some of
                    them quite well. We maintain friendships to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1985, you were assigned to the Department as the
                        Director of the Office of Central American Affairs. That was a quiet
                        time—only a civil war and a counter-revolution simultaneously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: When I was in Uruguay, I received a message asking me to return to the
                    Department for consultations. It was a period of turmoil for ARA personnel with
                    five DCM vacancies and other senior positions still to be filled after Reagan's
                    re-election of 1984. So the Bureau decided to bring to Washington as many
                    candidates for these jobs as it could identify and to conduct a mini job fair,
                    with the DCM candidates being interviewed at the same time by the ambassadors to
                    those five countries. These chiefs of mission were to select their DCMs through
                    this round-robin interview process—it was a unique approach to senior personnel
                    decisions. I was interviewed by all five ambassadors, although I had some
                    reservations about taking another DCM position. It was an interesting
                    experience; I was offered several of those vacant DCM jobs, including Honduras
                    and Peru, but in the final analysis, I thought I had already served as a DCM and
                    I would gain greater experience in an executive position in the Department—as an
                    office director.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>These five ambassadors were all looking for different attributes depending on
                    their own desires and the needs of the posts. They were a mix of career and
                    non-career ambassadors; the career ones, generally speaking, were more
                    sophisticated in what they were looking for—the smart ones looked for people
                    with complementary skills, different from their own. The non-career people, if
                    they were smart, also looked for candidates who cover gaps in their own
                    backgrounds as well as people with whom they felt comfortable and who were not
                    “yes” men. The smart ones selected good officers; the others didn't do so
                    well.</p>
                <p>I returned in 1985 to be the Office Director for Central American Affairs. There
                    was a new Assistant Secretary, Elliott Abrams. As a career person, I didn't give
                    that much thought. But while on home leave before starting my new assignment I
                    got a call from Abrams' secretary asking me to come to the Department to talk to
                    the Assistant Secretary. We had a very pleasant chat; I did not consider it to
                    be a job interview, but in retrospect I am sure that was exactly what it
                    was.</p>
                <p>Central America was a highly charged domestic political issue. But it was not
                    true, as some at the time asserted, that policies were set by the ideologues
                    while the “moderates” were on the outside looking in. The issues were important,
                    as they were controversial; people of all shades of opinion, participated in the
                    policy process. When people are deeply involved, it is more likely that personal
                    attacks will be made and that excesses may occur. That certainly was true during
                    my tour as Office Director. People often took things personally, even though the
                    debates were about policy. Outsiders don't fully understand the policy process.
                    If they disagree with the policy—and many did—too often they engaged in personal
                    attacks, including vilification of working-level officers both in the field and
                    Washington. This legacy, unfortunately, lives on in some areas.</p>
                <p>Many of the policies had already been extensively debated by the time I arrived
                    in the Office. The U.S. government had begun several years earlier, and was
                    continuing, to build up its capabilities in the region. The Washington
                    bureaucracy—in all agencies—dealing with Central America had also grown. In the
                    Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, my Office had already gone through an
                    expansion; when I took over, I think it was the largest Office in the
                    Department—more than 25 officers. There was also a significant turn-over of
                    staff at the time. So there were a lot of new people working on Central
                    America—in all departments and in the field as well. It was clear that there
                    were major stakes for the U.S. in each of the countries as well as considerable
                    domestic political interest.</p>
                <p>The situation in each of the countries was different. There were some common
                    threads, but the differences were quite significant.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Let me start with Panama, which also fell under my office. It was ruled by Manuel
                    Noriega at the time—directly or indirectly. He was undoubtedly calling the
                    shots. The main issue was corruption in the leadership. It was only later that
                    the drug connection surfaced. Panama was available to the highest bidder.
                    Noriega maintained relationships simultaneously with us and with Fidel Castro;
                    Panama was ambivalent about which horse to back in the several struggles
                    underway in the region. Noriega was not constant to any policy except the one of
                    greed and avarice. Our main effort was to try to move the country toward more
                    democracy and stronger political institutions. An election had been held and
                    Nicholas Barletta, a World Bank official, had won the Presidency. We had high
                    hopes that he would be the instrument through which democratic institutions
                    could be strengthened. But he ran afoul of Noriega, who had him deposed by a
                    pliant legislature. Barletta was pressured to resign; it was highly
                    controversial and we had lengthy discussions about possible US reactions. It
                    became much clearer later how Barletta was pressured to resign. Noriega took
                    more direct control and then Barletta repudiated his resignation.</p>
                <p>Within the U.S. government some people pushed for a visible gesture of support
                    for Barletta. The problem was his case was suspect because on the surface at
                    least he had resigned and the Panamanian Congress had accepted it without much
                    reluctance. To seek to restore him in such circumstances would have been
                    difficult to sustain, although in retrospect, it was probably the best of a
                    number of relatively poor policy choices available.</p>
                <p>The military-embassy relationship in Panama is and may well still be a continual
                    source of some concern. For many years, the U.S. military was by far the largest
                    and most visible US presence—we had something like 10,000 troops there at the
                    time. The Embassy was small and a relatively minor player in the policy game.
                    Large Panamanian issues always tended to have military implications which meant
                    that USSOUTHCOM, the Panama-based US unified military command, had usually the
                    predominant voice. Of course, the military was not always of one view. The
                    USSOUTHCOM commander was not very keen on using his troops for what he deemed to
                    be essentially political matters; so if incidents occurred, the U.S. commander
                    favored conciliation over confrontation. There had been incidents between US
                    military and Panamanian National Guard personnel from time to time. Some of our
                    soldiers had been injured; in one case there had been an abduction which
                    resulted in a wife being assaulted and a US soldier being beaten. When the
                    question of a US response arose, the U.S. commander's attitude seemed to be
                    “this too shall pass and we have larger issues at stake.” The civilians wanted
                    to take a tougher stance partly to prevent any misunderstanding by Noriega, who
                    controlled the National Guard. They felt that limits had to be set to prevent
                    the Panamanians from using the “salami” approach and whittling our rights away
                    slowly but surely.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>During the brief Barletta-Noriega struggle, had we—the US—been more vigorous and
                    had we been able to internally reach consensus on a strong response, the outcome
                    might have been different. Instead, we accommodated to what was a fait accompli.
                    I must say that to his credit, our Ambassador, Ted Briggs, argued strongly for
                    taking action against Noriega; in retrospect, he was absolutely correct. As I
                    suggested earlier, unfortunately the “legal” case for action against Noriega was
                    not very strong. Furthermore, I think Washington found the issues facing us in
                    El Salvador and Nicaragua to be of greater priority and that we had all we could
                    handle with those two countries. There were also some factors of which I was not
                    aware at the time—and still do not have a complete knowledge—that may have
                    weighed against taking firmer action in Panama. For example, it is now known
                    that there was a long standing relationship between Noriega and the CIA; I don't
                    know to what extent that was a factor.</p>
                <p>One of the results of this chapter in our relations with Panama was that I was
                    asked to take greater responsibility for Panamanian affairs. Until that time—and
                    for many years—although Panama was, according to the organization chart, the
                    responsibility of the Office of Central American Affairs, day-to-day management
                    of the relationship was handled by a deputy who had considerable autonomy and
                    who reported directly to a deputy assistant secretary. I believe that this
                    situation came about because of the importance and volume of work that
                    Panamanian affairs had previously generated—primarily stemming from
                    renegotiation of the Canal treaty. But after the Barletta ouster, the officer in
                    charge of Panamanian affairs was put explicitly under my supervision, and I took
                    a much more direct interest in issues that arose from our relations with
                    Panama.</p>
                <p>When I reported to ARA in 1985, we had a bump and shove relationship over the
                    Canal. The time table for our turning the operations of that waterway to Panama
                    had been established by treaty, but each time some action had to be taken—e.g.
                    transfer of territory or change in the composition and functions of the Panama
                    Canal Commission—there were endless debates in Panama City and Washington on the
                    interpretation and implementation of existing agreements. The Canal gave Panama
                    an important role in the region and was of strategic importance to the United
                    States, and time had to be devoted to its issues as well as those arising from
                    El Salvador and Nicaragua.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Costa Rica was significant at the time because it was one of Nicaragua's
                    neighbors. Efforts were underway to strengthen our relationship with Costa Rica
                    in the hopes of putting additional pressure on Nicaragua and the Sandinistas.
                    That effort was almost fatally flawed because it failed to take fully into
                    account traditionally strong propensities in Costa Rica. In the first place,
                    Costa Rica resisted being drawn into the Nicaraguan situation. The Costa Ricans
                    always considered themselves to be somewhat superior to the Nicaraguans in most
                    respects. Second, Costa Rica had taken a firm neutral position in all Central
                    American struggles; it had effectively abolished its armed forces years before,
                    although maintaining a very significant police force which was as large as many
                    military forces in Central America. But officially, Costa Rica did not have an
                    army. It had a strong tradition of civilian rule based on democratic principles
                    stemming from the days of Jose Figueres, who was still a political force
                    although he was no longer President. The Liberal Party of Figueres has long been
                    the dominant party in the country and had provided some support to the
                    Sandinistas in their struggle against the Somoza dynasty</p>
                <p>There were some signs in 1985 that the neutrality view might be shifting. We had
                    had a good cooperative relationship with Costa Rica based on containment of the
                    Sandinistas. That changed somewhat when Oscar Arias came to power; he became
                    more engaged in the Nicaraguan question; he looked for a diplomatic settlement.
                    One of his motivations was the Costa Rican concern for the Nicaraguan refugees
                    pouring across the border. Costa Rica had a high standard of living for a
                    Central American country. Its social indices were well above those of the other
                    countries in the region. The refugees were placing an increasing strain on the
                    social and even political fabric of the country. So Costa Rica had a very strong
                    interest in finding a settlement acceptable to all sides in Nicaragua. Arias was
                    also looking for a democratic outcome, but felt considerable pressure to reach a
                    settlement—almost any settlement. This drive lasted throughout his
                    administration.</p>
                <p>I don't think our personnel selections for Costa Rica were the best choices. Curt
                    Winsor and Lew Tambs, both non-career ambassadors, were very, very conservative.
                    Oscar Arias was a liberal in the classical sense. Tambs did not have the warmest
                    of relationships with Arias. Tambs was aggressive in his ideology; he had been
                    our Ambassador in Colombia where he had made a reputation as a vocal opponent of
                    the drug traffic. His strong position on drugs may have led people to overlook
                    some of his deficiencies—e.g. lack of subtlety. I went to Costa Rica as Charg�
                    after Tambs abruptly resigned during the Iran-Contra hearings, and had
                    considerable contact with Arias. I found him to be a very sophisticated, urbane
                    individual with views about politics and other matters which were quite subtle.
                    I don't think the nuances had been captured by our Embassy; they certainly were
                    not fully conveyed to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>When I talk about people, I do so with some reluctance. I recognize that it is
                    relatively easy to pass judgments now after time has passed and we have
                    knowledge that we may not have had at the time. Judgments that are clear now
                    were much murkier at the time. So some of the proposals and perspectives popular
                    at the time do not seem nearly as reasonable now. So some of Tambs suggestions
                    may have looked much better then than they do now. We were working under
                    pressures which placed El Salvador and Nicaragua at the head of the Central
                    America agenda; issues with other countries were almost secondary. So, to a
                    significant extent, our policy toward Costa Rica—and to an extent toward
                    Panama—was dictated by events and outcomes we were seeking in other countries.
                    Our Ambassador in El Salvador was quite clear that his country should have top
                    priority; solutions should first be sought in El Salvador, he argued, and then
                    the puzzle in Nicaragua would almost automatically sort itself out. Others said
                    that this was self-serving; the Sandinistas appeared to have a greater staying
                    power than the rebels in El Salvador. This was a subject for lively debate.</p>
                <p>We knew of Winsor's and Tambs' ideology, but I don't think we ever dismissed any
                    of their recommendations because of it. That is almost impossible in Washington
                    anyway because policy issues are seldom compartmentalized—i.e. a Costa Rican
                    issue could not be discussed separately from the whole of Central America. So a
                    recommendation from San Jose was most likely to touch on broader perspectives
                    which would raise the level at which it was discussed certainly above the desk
                    and frequently above the Office Director. There were a few issues, such as the
                    elections, which were sui generis—that is limited to Costa Rica—but they were
                    the exception. That was true of most of the “think pieces” from our ambassadors
                    in Central America; their recommendations tended to be applicable to most if not
                    all of the region and not just their country. I should point out that I didn't
                    overlap with Winsor very much; he left soon after I started my job in
                    Washington. So it was Tambs primarily with whom I dealt in Costa Rica. If he
                    felt very strongly about an issue, he would call Elliott Abrams or one of the
                    deputies directly; rarely would he call me or communicate directly with me. For
                    him, I was a relatively low level player.</p>
                <p>I should mention that during the 1984 US election a number of ambassadors had
                    signed a letter supporting the re-election of Jesse Helms (R-NC). Lew Tambs and
                    Curt Winsor were among the signatories. That was completely inappropriate, and
                    Secretary Shultz said so. One had to wonder about the judgments of individuals
                    who ignore the distinction between partisan political advocacy and the
                    professional approach demanded of all chiefs of mission. As time went along, I
                    noted questionable judgments by Tambs. On one occasion, he crossed the line in
                    entering into an unauthorized agreement with anti-Sandinista leader Eden
                    Pastora. Pastora was one of the original leaders of the Sandinista movement when
                    they overthrew Somoza, but later had a falling out with the Sandinista
                    leadership and went into semi-retirement as a fisherman in Costa Rica. Some
                    efforts were made to get him to rejoin the struggle against his old comrades;
                    Lew Tambs figured in those efforts, but I always thought the “understanding”
                    which he reached with Pastora, previously mentioned, crossed the line, and I so
                    advised Abrams. The “understanding” was disavowed.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>One of the considerations of dealing with recommendations from Tambs was that I
                    was never quite sure what agenda he was pursuing. It was not, I think, always
                    the Department's agenda. I was at times not quite certain where he was coming
                    from or where he was heading. Was it the same direction that we had agreed on? I
                    think it is true that if the two ends of the communication line do not have the
                    same agenda, the same operating assumptions, then your level of confidence at
                    both ends is bound to be affected.</p>
                <p>Next let me talk about Nicaragua. When I became Office Director, our policy did
                    not seem to be working. The Sandinistas seemed to be growing stronger and were
                    certainly more negative towards us and at the same time were more aggressive and
                    expansionist. So they appeared to be a greater threat than they had been in the
                    past. They were clearly our major concern in Central America. They were
                    providing aid and comfort to the guerrillas in El Salvador and any other groups
                    in the region that had the resources and the will to rebel against the
                    established order. The most significant of these relationships was the one they
                    had with the Salvadoran guerrillas.</p>
                <p>The principal advantage the Sandinistas held for other guerrilla organizations in
                    the region was that they were an established government—they held the reins of
                    power and effective control of a country. The rebels from other countries could
                    come to Nicaragua without fear of being harassed or expelled. They were received
                    sympathetically and, to limited extent, could expect some material support. So
                    Nicaragua had become a refuge for all the insurgents of Central America—a
                    R&amp;R place for them.</p>
                <p>The Sandinistas were driven by ideology. They were supporting crusades against
                    the established order, which frequently was corrupt and military dominated. The
                    object of the crusade was to “liberate” Central America. The Sandinistas viewed
                    themselves as the vanguard of this crusade and as such, believed they owed
                    support—material and psychological—to their brothers in arms in neighboring
                    countries. They had prevailed in Nicaragua and now believed they had a
                    revolutionary obligation to help others win power in their countries. This was
                    the situation in the mid-1980s.</p>
                <p>In the United States, a number of prominent Americans supported the Sandinistas.
                    Nicaragua was not normally a tourist mecca. But many Americans were drawn there
                    after the Sandinista take-over. It was much like the days when people went to
                    Cuba after Castro's victory, chopping cane to show solidarity with Fidel. Many
                    Americans went to Nicaragua to be hosted by the Sandinistas; they went to see
                    cooperatives and other symbols of Sandinista “progress.” Every week, on a
                    Wednesday morning, these Americans would gather in front of the U.S. Embassy for
                    a regularly scheduled demonstration of solidarity against the “imperialistic”
                    policies of their country. So we had a very active debate in the U.S. on our
                    Nicaraguan policy, which spilled over onto the editorial pages of our leading
                    newspapers.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Issues generate their own constituencies; as they grow, support networks also
                    expand. So by the mid-1980s, the Sandinista support in the United States was
                    quite sizeable. There were active centers in many universities—both around
                    Washington and around the country. These centers focused on US policies and were
                    by and large critical of the U.S. government. I personally did not view these
                    issues through an ideological prism. Like most Americans, I tend to favor the
                    underdog and favor democracy over dictatorship. One of the reasons I decided to
                    make the Foreign Service my career was because I wanted to be involved in these
                    policy issues, particularly in Latin America, where I thought our policy had
                    been on the wrong track for many years. We had sided too often with military
                    dictatorships and oligarchy and the economic interests of a few large firms,
                    such as United Fruit. So I had hoped to be able to influence our policy by
                    participating in its development.</p>
                <p>But I must say that as time went on, I began to feel that I had been ambushed on
                    some of these issues. When I had served in Nicaragua, I certainly was not a fan
                    of Somoza or any military or authoritarian figure in the region. In this, I
                    believe I was reflecting American values; if I had any biases, it was against
                    those regimes that the U.S. left also tended to oppose. But I found that the
                    dialogue on Central America became quickly personalized. I would talk to people,
                    but I seldom felt that my views were heard at all; their response was almost
                    automatically that, as a member of the government, I could not possibly be
                    anything but the “enemy” whose views were not worthy of consideration or even
                    hearing. That had not been my experience before, although my experience at
                    Wisconsin was a foretaste. Before the mid-1980s, regardless of audience, I think
                    I got a fair hearing wherever I was appearing, both in the U.S. and
                    overseas—with one exception that took place in London when I was talking to some
                    students about El Salvador and US defense policy. There I pretty much heard what
                    was to be the standard position; namely that I was the representative of an
                    odious government and therefore not worth hearing. I was shouted down. It was a
                    throwback to the University of Wisconsin in 1970-71.</p>
                <p>So I had some experience with intolerance and found it disturbing. It left a very
                    bad taste in my mouth when people, in the name of democracy, did not allow views
                    contrary to their own to be expressed in open forums. There was far too much of
                    this. Both sides of the issue took some very peremptory stances; issues were
                    personalized and people demonized, which was unhealthy and fueled paranoia on
                    both sides.</p>
                <p>Let me talk about El Salvador now. Napoleon Duarte had been elected President; he
                    generated hope because he was clearly a democrat with impeccable credentials. He
                    was a strong leader coming out of the Christian Democratic movement in which he
                    had participated for many years. He had been abused and tortured by the
                    Salvadoran military who had denied him elective office on several occasions.
                    There was great hope that Duarte would bring greater democratic freedom to El
                    Salvador; he was a fresh breeze, unfettered by ties to past excesses. Many hoped
                    that Duarte could bring peace to his country. There was some optimism, even
                    though the situation on the ground did not look promising.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The Salvadoran military, as in most of the Central American countries, did not
                    have a very good reputation—deservingly so. They had been associated with
                    abuses—both human rights violations and corruption. An escalating armed
                    confrontation with Marxist guerrillas, which inevitably put greater power in the
                    hands of the military, was not only distasteful, but worked against the
                    introduction of democratic reforms.</p>
                <p>The situation in El Salvador in 1985 then was not good. There had been
                    predictions in years past that El Salvador had turned the corner; in fact it was
                    still looking for that corner. Still, Duarte provided hope that a settlement
                    could be reached. Later there were discussions about how we should set our own
                    priorities—should we concentrate on helping Duarte reach an acceptable solution
                    in El Salvador or should we concentrate on Nicaragua? Given the small size of
                    Central American countries, one would think that the U.S. government would be
                    able to pursue policies appropriate to each country. But that was hard to
                    do.</p>
                <p>The Salvadoran guerrilla view was to “stay the course” because the U.S. had no
                    staying power—a view derived from their assessment of our Vietnam experience—and
                    would eventually lose interest in the region particularly if some American blood
                    was shed. In 1985, the guerrillas murdered several Embassy Marine guards at a
                    restaurant in San Salvador to bring the costs of war more directly to the
                    attention of the American people. It was a calculated act. From time to time,
                    other Americans were targeted for the same reason. They hoped that the first
                    Reagan administration would be defeated and that the next one would be more
                    sympathetic to their views.</p>
                <p>There were mixed views about the origins of the guerrilla movement. Some thought
                    they were creatures of the Soviets, some of the Cubans, some of the Sandinistas.
                    I don't think it was a simple matter to determine paternity. The Sandinistas
                    clearly had connections to the Cubans, certainly through Tomas Borge—the
                    Minister of the Interior in charge of the police—and to a lesser extent through
                    the Ortega brothers who had been given sanctuary in Cuba during an earlier
                    period. The Sandinistas clearly received support from the Cubans—Soviet arms and
                    other subsidies. But to characterize them as creatures of the Soviets or the
                    Cubans would have missed the point. The Nicaraguans had a strong Marxist home
                    grown faction; the Sandinistas had a history and an ideology—Marxist—which
                    guided their actions; their blueprint for consolidation of power was a
                    combination of their own experience, ideas that they had picked up in Cuba, and
                    classical Marxist theory. To dismiss them as mere puppets of Cuba or the Soviets
                    with no domestic base would have been a misreading of reality. Not many, I
                    think, really believed otherwise although in a debate they might charge that the
                    Sandinistas were tools of foreign powers—to underscore the view that a Central
                    American foothold by the Soviets and Cuba could be a real threat to the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Throughout Central America the standard of living was—and is—very low. There are
                    significant inequalities in living standards, land tenure or any other economic
                    index; Central America ranks near the bottom in Latin America. The grievances of
                    the population are numerous and legitimate; that was what gave popular support
                    to the guerrilla movements—not to mention wide support in the United States.
                    Many Americans resented their government being allied with repressive regimes
                    which did nothing to try to raise the standard of living of their people; on the
                    contrary, these regimes used abusive policies to try to suppress any
                    manifestation of discontent. Our relationships with these authoritarian regimes
                    suggested complicity with these odious policies; that raised further opposition
                    in the U.S. to our policies in Latin America by groups consisting of, in large
                    part, altruistic, idealistic people—many of them from religious organizations
                    and many with considerable knowledge of the region. They could not be easily
                    dismissed as ideologues and dupes of the communists; they were solid citizens
                    who felt deeply about the political, economic and social conditions in Latin
                    America. My quarrel with those people at the time was that they did not give us
                    and others the benefit of the doubt and would refuse to believe that there were
                    people in their government who shared many of their concerns and who were also
                    trying to do something about the appalling conditions in the region. The most
                    vocal critics refused to believe that there were any other remedies than their
                    own; they would not listen to any suggestions of other approaches.</p>
                <p>The most effective religious organizations were associated with the Catholic
                    Church-related. Although the population of Central America is heavily Catholic,
                    religious orders have long been in decline throughout the region. That vacuum is
                    filled by priests and nuns sent from the U.S. and Europe; so there were many
                    active Catholic orders in Central America. In the 1980s, a number of them were
                    actively engaged in providing camps in the region—the way to change the economic
                    conditions, they came to believe, is through political action. So many priests
                    and nuns became involved with some of the political movements in Central
                    America—as a way to improve the economic and social conditions of the people
                    they served. That support continues even when some of the groups being supported
                    took to arms to change the political structure. The attitude of the priests and
                    nuns was frequently supported by their colleagues in the religious orders in the
                    United States who then became a factor in the political debate in the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>In the case of El Salvador, there were organized efforts to bring Salvadorans to
                    the US—to provide refuge from persecution and violence. There were legitimate
                    pressures put on the U.S. political system to legitimize this inflow of refugees
                    by changing the presumption of the law that to be a legitimate refugee, the
                    applicant had to prove persecution. The law was changed for the Salvadorans and
                    later the Nicaraguans; it allowed temporary refugee status for people from those
                    countries which allowed them to be employed in the U.S. while the conditions
                    from which they had fled persisted. But before the law was changed, some
                    American religious groups were harboring illegal refugees—as a protest against
                    the laws and policies of their country. We were only indirectly involved in this
                    area since immigration issues were the responsibility of INS, within guidelines
                    established by Congress. Because of the underlying policy issues, however, we
                    would be demonized along with our colleagues in the INS and other agencies.
                    Elliott Abrams became a man with fangs and horns, and we were depicted as his
                    mindless clones.</p>
                <p>Now let me turn to Honduras. Of all of the Central American countries, Honduras
                    would be in the second tier. It was traditionally the poorest country in the
                    region. There had been an effort in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Central
                    America to break away from dependence on a single agricultural product—sugar
                    cane, bananas, coffee, pineapples, timber. Honduras never made the break. There
                    were efforts, but they were modest indeed. El Salvador was the most successful
                    in this effort. It was the smallest country, but it had attracted enough
                    investment in industry to have built a respectable base. A simultaneous effort
                    to achieve economic integration in Central America essentially benefitted
                    established industries—those that were already dominant in one or more countries
                    of the region. So countries like Honduras, with no industries, fell farther
                    behind. El Salvador did achieve significant benefits from economic integration
                    as did Guatemala. Benefits elsewhere were modest.</p>
                <p>Honduras was left largely behind. There was a separation between inland
                    Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, on the coast. San Pedro Sula was doing much
                    better. Honduras was traditionally controlled by conservative military leaders,
                    regardless of the form of government. Honduras had not been friendly towards
                    either El Salvador or Nicaragua—wary of the latter and in frequent conflict with
                    the former. Much of the tension resulted from population spill over from fast
                    growing, but tiny El Salvador. The famous “soccer war” between the two countries
                    reflected these tensions. Animosity between Honduras and El Salvador had existed
                    for many years. We had tried in the 1970s to balance our military assistance
                    between the two countries—at low level. By the mid-1980s, the situation had
                    changed; El Salvador and Nicaragua had risen to the top of our agenda; Honduras
                    had become a partner in our policy; El Salvador was a zone of conflict between
                    the Duarte government and the Marxist insurgents, the FMLN.</p>
                <p>Honduras had gone through a political transformation; it had held democratic
                    elections which resulted in a civilian President. But democratic institutions
                    were non-existent or very weak, so that the military remained in de facto
                    control. Our policy to build democratic institutions in the region first had to
                    deal with ongoing conflict both in Nicaragua and El Salvador; Honduras took
                    lower priority once again.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>The Salvadoran guerrillas established training and rest and recuperation
                    facilities in UN-run refugee camps just over the Honduran border, which the
                    Honduran military viewed as a threat to the security of their country. On their
                    other border, the Salvadorans saw the major build up by the Sandinista armed
                    forces. So they obviously supported all our efforts to reduce the power of the
                    Sandinistas and the Salvadoran guerrillas. When the Nicaraguan Resistance or
                    Contras were formed, the Honduran military were quite sympathetic because they
                    viewed this force as a buffer between themselves and the Sandinistas. So the
                    Hondurans cooperated in our efforts to support the Contras.</p>
                <p>Guatemala was a terrible story. It had long endured low-level indigenous
                    guerrilla warfare. The population was heavily Indian—the most in the region. The
                    guerrilla movement had started with the Indians. The regime's response was
                    ruthless and much bloodshed ensued. The country had always suffered from
                    violence—individuals were personally armed. That was true in much of Central
                    America; they were violent societies and the shedding of blood seemed to come
                    much too easily. The guerrilla warfare in Guatemala was low level, but
                    persistent. It had not captured much attention, except from some US groups—which
                    highlighted the human rights abuses taking place in the region. These groups
                    quite properly were applying pressure to reduce the level of the abuses and the
                    violence.</p>
                <p>Many of these groups blamed the abuses and violence on US policy. That was a
                    problem; most of those involved in the policy, on all sides, would agree that
                    the abuses were taking place, but differences would appear when it came to
                    assessing blame. The critics maintained that US policy was at the root of the
                    problems; some even suggested that the U.S. itself was guilty of some of the
                    abuses. The policy makers focused on how the abuses could be mitigated while
                    keeping the focus on other policy issues, including economic development and
                    democratization. So efforts at dialogue between policy-makers and critics
                    quickly broke down with each side accusing the other of bad faith.</p>
                <p>In one case I recall, one of the critics was calling attention to some human
                    rights abuses in Guatemala and holding US policies responsible. One of my staff
                    said, “That is factually wrong. We should answer that allegation.” It was not
                    the specific case that was at the issue; it was overall U.S. policy that was
                    being challenged. In retrospect, by publicly responding to specific allegations,
                    we may have actually heightened the level of the polemics. That might have been
                    inevitable, but I look back with some regret on that episode, which appeared to
                    pit us against the human rights advocates. People who were calling attention to
                    the abuses were correct to do so, as were we in defending US policy. It was
                    unfortunate that the two sides could never have a meeting of minds. If we could
                    have, we might have made more progress quicker.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>In Guatemala the leadership was suspect. The level of violence and the power of
                    the military tended to drive the democrats out or underground. The U.S.
                    government is not monolithic in its views on military regimes or the political
                    role of the military. Some elements of the government are more comfortable than
                    others on working with the military in power. Our policy over the years has
                    encouraged the establishment of strong relationships between the U.S. armed
                    forces and foreign military services; these relationships are often very
                    helpful, but sometimes can also be negative. You can never be quite sure that
                    all elements of the U.S. government are communicating the same message; the
                    informal contacts between people—US and their foreign counterparts—at times may
                    convey different signals that can confuse and, in some cases, actually undermine
                    US policy. Our military-to-military relationships may not have always helped in
                    Central America.</p>
                <p>Belize is an appendage to Central America. While conflict raged in the rest of
                    the region in the mid-1980s, the central issue in Belize was its dispute with
                    neighboring governments. So in addition to the other problems we had to deal
                    with, we had to face this possibility of armed conflict between the two
                    countries. There was a residual—small—British military presence in Belize to
                    stabilize the situation. This was most helpful. We were looking for a negotiated
                    settlement. Eventually, with good sense all around, it came.</p>
                <p>What I have done to this point is to describe essentially the situation which I
                    encountered when I reported for duty in 1985. Let me talk a little more about
                    what happened in the 1985-88 period.</p>
                <p>As I have said, one of our principal goals in the region was to foster democratic
                    development. Progress was hindered by endemic human rights abuses and violence.
                    Add to that mix the guerrilla movements which perpetuated the violence. Our
                    challenge was to find means to change this situation over the long run. The
                    policy makers viewed the Salvadoran guerrillas and the Sandinistas as
                    essentially anti-democratic. They were authoritarian and based on a Marxist
                    philosophy which certainly was not democratic. In addition, these insurgents
                    were guilty of extensive human rights abuses. They were certainly not the
                    democratic answer for the region. So our priority was to find democratic
                    alternatives to these guerrilla movements.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>In Nicaragua, pursuit of our objectives led to the development of an armed
                    resistance movement which operated from bases on the Nicaragua/Honduras border
                    and in the south of Nicaragua as well. We gave this group—which became known as
                    Contras—heavy support. Contrary to how they were characterized by their
                    detractors, the Contras were essentially a peasant resistance movement; most
                    came from very humble origins—most from the rural areas of Nicaragua. They did
                    not like the Sandinistas and their authoritarian ways. Ironically, both the
                    Contras and many of the original Sandinista supporters might have agreed on a
                    broad reform program, including land reform and other societal changes. But the
                    ideological schism which separated the two groups was so large that dialogue was
                    impossible—even among family members some of whom may have backed the
                    Sandinistas and some of whom may have backed the Resistance. I have no question
                    that the Contras were fully committed to their cause; they could not have
                    organized otherwise. There has not been sufficient analysis of this grass-roots
                    army; I think it would be a very interesting story.</p>
                <p>Ollie North was a relatively junior member of the NSC staff in 1985. He was not
                    even a member of the NSC office which handled Latin America; he was part of the
                    politico-military staff focusing on terrorism and national security issues.
                    Gradual, however, he became more and more involved in Central America. He was a
                    strong personality who seemed to have very little supervision in the White
                    House. In retrospect, it is interesting to note that North was really a low
                    level staffer—he was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps. Lieutenant
                    Colonels do not make policy. But Ollie North did not fit the norm. I first met
                    North at an anti-terrorism conference in Panama when I was DCM in Uruguay. I was
                    surprised by the deference shown him by people much senior to him. When he stood
                    up to make comments, general officers and senior Washington officials who knew
                    who he was paid attention. So did I.</p>
                <p>I had no further contact with North until I had been in my Office Director's job
                    for some time. There were occasional inquiries about specific issues, but little
                    more. Only later did he emerge as the key NSC staffer on Central America,
                    pushing aside the State Department officer on the NSC staff who formally carries
                    that responsibility. He became the NSC representative on a restricted
                    inter-agency group which reviewed most of the major Central American issues,
                    particularly as they related to Nicaragua.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I had more exposure to him later. Our laws changed; initially Congress had
                    authorized US government support for the Nicaraguan resistance; then it cut off
                    support and then changed again to allow limited support—humanitarian assistance.
                    A separate organization within the Department was established to provide that
                    assistance. Ambassador Robert Duemling was brought in to head up this new
                    office. He was a very good choice; he was scrupulously honest and made sure that
                    his mandate was scrupulously observed. I know much more now about this than I
                    did at the time the effort was organized. For example, I now know, from Oliver
                    North's testimony, that a parallel organization had been established in which he
                    was involved. There was a question of how humanitarian assistance would be
                    delivered to the resistance. It had to be done by air, which limited the numbers
                    of people who were willing to undertake this effort. There aren't many
                    independent contractors who are willing to drop supplies into hostile territory.
                    And there aren't many companies or individuals anxious to expose their aircraft
                    to enemy fire.</p>
                <p>Therefore among Duemling's first task was the hiring of contractors to undertake
                    the supply operation. Ollie North knew some people; it was not clear at the
                    time—as it is today—that these people had been involved in the off-the-books
                    army supply operation to the Contras. To Duemling's credit, he was very
                    scrupulous in ensuring that the letter of the law was followed. He did not
                    knowingly allow any of the aircraft he contracted to be used for simultaneous
                    arms deliveries. He only allowed his contractors to deliver humanitarian
                    assistance on flights his offices paid for as authorized by law. He was under
                    pressure from a number of quarters to deliver more than humanitarian assistance;
                    resistance wanted more than just food and medicines. Duemling made sure that all
                    of his activities met the letter of the law; that was much to his credit.</p>
                <p>As I said, the assistance to the resistance was run by a separate office in the
                    Department. A lot of the work of this office had to do with logistics and
                    contracting. We did not have any day-to-day association with that office. In our
                    Office Directorate, as is usual in the Department, we had desk officers for each
                    of the Central American countries; they handled the day-to-day matters. Although
                    we were involved in larger policy issues, by and large fundamental policies were
                    decided above our level. The desk officers, who were most knowledgeable about
                    their countries, might suggest different approaches than the prevailing wisdom;
                    a debate would follow—that happened frequently and to good effect. But the
                    larger issues were dealt with in the restricted interagency group in which we
                    were not normally represented.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I don't think we had any major disagreement with the policies developed in the
                    interagency group. The transgressions that did take place did so outside our
                    purview; we did not find out about them until some time later. Much of what came
                    out of the North's hearings was news to us. There were aspects of the Central
                    American operations that were not under State Department control. For example,
                    when the Contra supply plane was shot down over Nicaragua—which occurred toward
                    the end of my tour—the first question to us was “Who is he?” He turned out to be
                    an American citizen who had been captured by the Sandinistas. We later found out
                    that he was a member of a support network that was not related to the
                    humanitarian assistance effort in the slightest. The issue then became what
                    would happen to this American citizen. As far as we knew, he was not on the
                    government's payroll. There was a common sense issue. I had learned that when an
                    American citizen is in real peril, one of our most common failings was not how
                    the case was ultimately decided, but rather how we managed the process, e.g.
                    what contacts and information do we provide the family. The hostage taking in
                    Iran, for example, had demonstrated the importance of being supportive and
                    forthcoming to families of the victims.</p>
                <p>So in this case, I wanted to make sure that that past shortcoming would not be
                    repeated. We were in touch as soon as we could with the family of the American
                    airman and tried to provide all the information we had available. The
                    Sandinistas wanted the family to come to Nicaragua so they could make some
                    political points through a show trial. Mrs. Hassenfus wanted to get her husband
                    out of Nicaragua. She engaged a lawyer. Even though the lawyer served on a pro
                    bono basis, the cost to the Hassenfus family quickly mounted. Our desk officer
                    had been acting as an intermediary with Mrs. Hassenfus. He reported that Mrs.
                    Hassenfus was increasingly anxious about the costs and her own support while her
                    husband was being detained. He asked for guidance. I told the desk officer just
                    to take no further action and went to see Elliott Abrams. I told Abrams that I
                    didn't think it was proper for the desk officer to be involved in the issue of
                    resources; this was not something the U.S. government should be funding. He
                    agreed. So we didn't get involved in the Hassenfus case beyond what we might do
                    in a consular sense.</p>
                <p>It is clear now—it wasn't then—that Mrs. Hassenfus believed her husband was a US
                    government employee. We did not. So we were starting from two entirely different
                    premises. Mrs. Hassenfus wanted US government officials drawn into the case, and
                    believed that it was a US government problem because the principal was an
                    employee. We on the other hand viewed the case as a protection and welfare
                    matter which did not require any further involvement than a normal case of this
                    kind would require. We wanted to be helpful in assisting a US citizen and to
                    limit public diplomacy losses but that would be the limit of our involvement; we
                    stopped the desk officer from participating any further in this matter.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>CIA's role in managing assistance to the Contras was circumscribed by law. The
                    legislation changed several times in the mid-1980s. For example, the bill
                    authorizing humanitarian assistance to the Nicaragua resistance movement
                    specifically gave that responsibility to the Department, which was almost unique
                    in some respects. Activities of this kind would in the past have been the
                    exclusive preserve of the Agency, but by this time the Congressional debate
                    focused on whether the management of this program belonged in the Agency. The
                    support to the resistance was duly authorized by Congress, but it was subject to
                    an unusual amount of public debate and scrutiny. It was unique that the
                    Department and some of its personnel were involved in an activity that before
                    would have been the exclusive province of another government agency.</p>
                <p>I think there is always a concern that in situations such as in Nicaragua—and
                    much of Central America—the fine hand of the Central Intelligence Agency might
                    be involved. There is a division of responsibilities in the U.S. government
                    which is quite proper. Problems arise, however, when the Department does not
                    have access to all information it needs concerning a specific issue,
                    particularly when other agencies are involved. Reliance on agencies which are
                    not open to public scrutiny and failure to include in the decision-making
                    process all those with a legitimate interest in the outcome can produce very
                    poor results. I think a more open process would have been better, but this is
                    said with the advantage of hindsight.</p>
                <p>Nicaragua under the Sandinistas was a very interesting problem in diplomatic
                    relations. We conducted normal relations with the Sandinista government while
                    giving assistance to people who were intent on overthrowing that government. We
                    had a modest Embassy in Managua, headed first by Tony Quainton and then Harry
                    Bergold. It must have been an interesting experience for the Sandinistas as
                    well, dealing with representatives of a government bent on replacing them. On
                    the ground, the Ambassador's access to the government and those associated with
                    it was completely controlled by the Sandinistas. The American Ambassador has
                    always had high profile in Managua; he travels in a large chauffeur driven
                    limousine; at that time he was protected by the Sandinistas, with a government
                    provided personal police riding in the front seat of the car. So that his every
                    movement was well known; every contact was recorded. Those constraints certainly
                    limited the Ambassador's access both to the government as well as to the
                    opposition. Within the government, the Sandinista leadership would decide who
                    would see the American Ambassador and how frequently. So if the Ambassador
                    wanted access to one of the Ortegas; Interior Minister Tomas Borge; or Miguel
                    Descoto, the Foreign Minister, or anyone else, the Sandinistas would decide who
                    and when—or if at all. So our ability to conduct business in Managua was highly
                    circumscribed, although an Ambassador's style was obviously an important factor
                    in our ability to conduct business with the Sandinistas.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Our Ambassadors developed some access. I don't like to characterize the points of
                    view of my predecessors, but I think I had more exposure to Bergold's approach.
                    Quainton was in place when I began my job in Washington, but was not there long
                    thereafter. Bergold was certainly not a Sandinista supporter, but he reached the
                    conclusion that the Sandinistas would probably be in power for an extended
                    period. That analysis suggested a re-examination of some of our policies and
                    activities; his view challenged some of the assumptions on which our policy was
                    based, principal among them that the Sandinistas should not be considered a
                    permanent fixture. Harry felt that we would be more effective if we would accept
                    the reality that the Sandinistas would be governing Nicaragua for many years and
                    therefore deal with them as we might with an Eastern European communist state,
                    whose policies and attitudes we also did not like—governments which Bergold knew
                    well. So he questioned some of our anti-Sandinista activities. While
                    intellectually I could appreciate this point of view, I was loath the support
                    and approach which might actually contribute to the Sandinistas ability to
                    remain in power.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Nicaraguan representatives in Washington had wide contacts
                    with a variety of support groups in the area. They had extensive contacts on the
                    Hill, both with members of Congress and staffers, to whom they made their case
                    in effective ways. They had less contacts with the Department; we would see them
                    from time to time, but not on a regular basis. They had a small staff in
                    Washington, as we did in Managua. We would periodically call in senior
                    Nicaraguan diplomats to chastise them about excesses on Nicaragua or to notify
                    them of restrictions on their mission, usually in retaliation for action against
                    ours. Those contacts were proper and formal. I suspect that the Nicaraguans had
                    calculated that they would not get much out of the Department or the
                    administration in general and that they needed to make their pitch to a more
                    sympathetic audience provided by non-government organizations and certain
                    Congressional officials. They used public diplomacy in a very effective way,
                    taking full advantage of our open society. The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry
                    spokesman, Alejandro Benaria, was their most effective public figure; he had
                    attended the University of California at Berkeley. Many Sandinistas had attended
                    American universities and colleges and spoke perfect English; they made very
                    good spokesmen for their cause on US TV talk shows on which they appeared
                    regularly. On those TV shows, including the network evening news, the U.S.
                    position was usually presented by a non-administration person who may not have
                    been familiar with the most current information; Elliott Abrams was the only
                    official who would appear regularly. While Abrams was more than a match for the
                    Sandinista representative, the U.S. government's position was not always so well
                    represented and the Nicaraguans often made the better case. When Abrams
                    appeared, it was a different story; he knew his brief well and was an aggressive
                    and pugnacious protagonist—which may be one of the reasons that he had so many
                    problems later.</p>

                <p>The polarization that took place in the U.S. over Central American policy was
                    evident among Congressional staffs. There was a lot of more heat than light
                    generated by public discussion. People had made up their minds before the debate
                    began. They took ideological stands, minimizing any possibility of an
                    intelligent discussion. One either agreed with a staffer or you didn't; no
                    conversation was necessary. Our Office staff was on the Hill frequently; we
                    passed out a lot of information. But since we supported US policy, we were
                    viewed by the opponents of that policy with great suspicion. Further aggravating
                    the situation was the fact that the administration was Republican while Congress
                    was in the hands of the Democrats. So we were subject to criticism from the
                    majority in Congress. Since the Democrats had controlled Congress for many
                    years, the committee staffs were also led by the Democrats; the minority
                    staffers were fewer in number and generally not as experienced since by and
                    large they had not served as long as the majority staff. So the staff which
                    handled Central American matters tended to be quite critical of the
                    administration.</p>
                <p>There seemed to be more give-and-take on policy within our own bureaus. There was
                    a debate at the time about our policy vis-a-vis El Salvador. The view from
                    Embassy San Salvador, not surprisingly was that the U.S. should be giving
                    priority to that country. If the support for the Salvadoran guerrillas could be
                    cut, the Embassy argued, then a satisfactory solution to that country's
                    political problems could be achieved. So the suggestion was that we begin to
                    move in that direction, including reaching some accommodation with the
                    Sandinistas if that would end their support of the Salvadoran insurgents. The
                    other view was that, until the Nicaraguan issue was resolved, no lasting
                    settlement was likely in El Salvador. So the problems in both countries had to
                    be tackled simultaneously. The latter view was the predominant view.</p>
                <p>My impression then and now was that President Reagan was primarily interested in
                    the big picture, he was not that interested in details of policy implementation.
                    These were left to others; they managed the policy implementation process. But
                    the approval of the broad outlines of a policy and its public articulation was a
                    presidential responsibility; I think he was very effective in that role. The
                    President was also involved in discussions with foreign leaders who came to
                    Washington, like President Duarte. Day-to-day implementation decisions were left
                    to the policy managers.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>When I left the Office Director job, the Nicaraguan and Salvadoran issues were
                    moving in a new direction. A substantial fatigue factor had set in for all
                    parties. In the U.S. revelations of wrong doing and excesses had come to light.
                    There were new efforts to find solutions to the issues raised by the Sandinistas
                    and the Salvadorans. Speaker Jim Wright's involvement is well documented.
                    President Arias of Costa Rica had become very involved in trying to find a way
                    out of the quagmire. A new Assistant Secretary, Bernie Aronson, had been
                    appointed. He had been involved, as a private citizen, in efforts to support the
                    Nicaraguan resistance; he now focused his and the bureau's efforts on finding a
                    political solution to end the fighting in Central America. Gradually, the
                    “problem solvers” took over; to the great credit of all who were involved, they
                    found a formula to end the fighting, the Nicaraguans, a democratic election
                    eventually led to an end to the bloodshed.</p>
                <p>The key to finding solutions to Central American issues was to get beyond the
                    partisan sniping both here and in the region to find acceptable accommodations
                    unrelated to politics. We wanted a peace process which would expand democratic
                    institutions in the region. The settlement eventually reached provided only the
                    possibility of a way out of the problem on El Salvador and Nicaragua. The lion's
                    share of the credit should go to the people of both countries, who, given the
                    opportunity, caused democracy.</p>
                <p>I should mention two additional interesting matters. Toward the end of my tour in
                    the Office of Central American Affaires there were ambassadorial vacancies in
                    Honduras and Costa Rica. The first vacancy occurred when Ambassador John Ferch
                    was relieved of his duties in Honduras by Secretary George Shultz—in the midst
                    of negotiations and active US diplomacy. Ferch got at cross purposes with Shultz
                    and Abrams and was called home. The difference between Ferch and Washington was
                    largely one of perceptions. This was a delicate period in our relationships with
                    Honduran authorities in large part because the Nicaraguan resistance was
                    operating from the Honduras/Nicaragua border area. That required some
                    understanding from the Honduran authorities, including the Honduran military
                    which played a major role in the politics of the country. The bilateral
                    relationship had its ups and downs partially because the military were hard to
                    deal with; they extracted a price for their cooperation. Shultz and Abrams felt
                    that we could only get the cooperation we needed through aggressive diplomatic
                    representations; they believed that Ferch did not meet their requirements. So
                    Secretary Shultz decided to relieve him of his mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Shortly after that, I was asked to go to Managua to act as Charg� while decisions
                    were pending about Embassy leadership. So I went for about a month until Bob
                    Pasterino, the new DCM arrived to assume charge. My job in Honduras was
                    essentially to hold the fort until the necessary personnel decisions had been
                    reached. It was nevertheless a very busy month: there were many things going on.
                    We had some disruptions in our operations; the USAID building had previously
                    been sacked by an unruly mob. Though the relationship at the formal level was
                    very friendly, there were many undercurrents which made the relationship
                    somewhat precarious. My job was to keep things together. We had the normal
                    mission operations and a major peace initiative underway. While I was there, a
                    Honduran married to an American contract employee was murdered. The American was
                    attached to a military facility far from Tegucigalpa. The episode raised
                    questions about the authority of the chief of mission because the American
                    employee involved worked for a military contractor; he was not a direct hire
                    employee. The contractor urged that the employee be spirited out of the country,
                    thereby removing him from Honduran jurisdiction. When I was so informed, I
                    called the contract director to my office and told him that he and his employees
                    came under chief of mission authority and that meant that his employee would not
                    leave Honduras until host government authorities authorized his departure. The
                    contractor appealed my decision through military communication channels, but DoD
                    supported me and the employee stayed. He was processed through the Honduran
                    justice system which in time found him “not responsible.” So every day, it
                    seemed, something new would pop up in addition to the daily decisions that had
                    to be made on mission operations.</p>
                <p>There were continuing programs of assistance to the Nicaraguan resistance. At a
                    minimum, as Charg�, I had to be kept informed about this activity to make sure
                    that Washington was fully aware of what was going on in Honduras. There was a
                    lot of activity; this was not your traditional diplomatic program. There had
                    been a long tradition in this area of activities by other agencies; the chief of
                    mission was not as completely informed as he or she should have been. It was
                    very hard for a newcomer, particularly a short timer, to establish an
                    appropriate process to ensure full disclosure; so I did have a feeling of being
                    on a treadmill. Much more needed to be done to bring all U.S. government
                    activities under the purview of the chief of mission. The other agencies were
                    very active with their own programs and were not entirely under the control of
                    the chief of mission.</p>
                <p>I found the Honduran civilian authorities to be quite good—particularly the
                    President and Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Lopez was a distinguished
                    lawyer and a very impressive individual. But the military leadership was another
                    story. They did not inspire a great deal of confidence, but since they were in
                    their positions we had to deal with them. But it was difficult; the military
                    high command had its own agenda which was not always supportive of democratic
                    institutions. Furthermore, they did not exude honesty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1988, you went to Costa Rica. To do what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MELTON That was also a temporary assignment. Ambassador Lew Tambs resigned
                    unexpectedly. By that time, he was very much involved in the Iran/Contra
                    hearings. It was clear that he would have a lot to say and that there would be
                    many questions asked about his knowledge of events in Costa Rica. He chose to
                    resign—without notice—creating an immediate vacancy. So I was asked to go to San
                    Jose to run the Embassy until a permanent Charg� could be selected and sent.
                    This was in late 1987—while the hearings on the Hill were in full swing.</p>
                <p>Tambs was very, very conservative. He had come from the Thunderbird University in
                    Arizona. He had been very vocal in support of conservative causes even while
                    serving as Ambassador—e.g. support for Jesse Helms during the Senator's
                    re-election campaign—that led, as I previously mentioned, to a rebuke from the
                    Secretary. He was outspoken and independent minded—that was not always a plus
                    because in some cases he went beyond the limits of US policy.</p>
                <p>Tambs was difficult to work with because he didn't always make an effort to
                    coordinate his activities with us in Washington. There were times when after the
                    fact we were informed of matters about which we should have been advised. In one
                    case, he held conversations with members of the Nicaraguan resistance, including
                    Eden Pastora, during which any objective observer would agree that he implied
                    commitments of US government support to Pastora—which he was not authorized to
                    provide. After Tambs reported his meeting to Washington, he was told that he had
                    gone beyond his brief; his response was that we had misconstrued his comments.
                    We made sure that the record was corrected since Tambs' commitments were against
                    policy and existing law. A written reprimand from the Assistant Secretary
                    followed.</p>
                <p>Central America is a mixture of differing countries and people. A non-career
                    person, interested in the region, was frequently attracted to Costa Rica, in
                    part because it was the most advanced of the countries in the
                    region—economically as well as politically. In contrast to most Central American
                    countries, it has a hospitable climate and is generally a very pleasant country.
                    If one is looking for an attractive place to be an Ambassador Costa Rica was it.
                    That perhaps is why we have a series of non-career ambassadors there—Curt Winsor
                    and Lew Tambs continued this tradition. Of course, Costa Rica was not entirely
                    unique in this regard. There have been a number of Central American countries
                    which had controversial non-career American ambassadors.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I was in Costa Rica as Charg� for about three months—longer than I had
                    anticipated. I really got into the operations of the mission. We had a large
                    USAID program; there was some concern that aspects of the program did not
                    conform with USAID and US government regulations. There were also concerns about
                    the sale of vehicles by US government employees which did not meet the
                    requirements established by the Department. Additionally, we had some questions
                    about the management of assistance to the Nicaraguan resistance. I got into all
                    of these questions. There were some elements of that resistance operating from
                    Costa Rican territory; Tambs had been deeply involved—the so-called “Opening of
                    the Southern Front,” much to the dismay of the Costa Rican authorities. We had
                    to deal with Oscar Arias, the President of Costa Rica, who was becoming
                    increasingly active in the search for an overall settlement in Central
                    America—Arias was playing the “honest broker” role and challenging aspects of US
                    policy. While in San Jose, I met with Arias on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>We had a number of Congressional and other visitors—many of whom wanted to talk
                    to Arias. So the three months were very active. The Soviets had a very active
                    Ambassador in San Jose and I got to know him well; that was interesting because
                    this was a period of transition in Moscow—glasnost—and no one knew how it would
                    turn out. I had, while in Washington, participated in annual discussions with
                    the Soviets on Latin America, which we had initiated. These were held first in
                    Washington and then London, but the first meeting was quite unsuccessful—the two
                    sides talked past each other. The next one in London, at the Soviet Embassy, was
                    much more promising. The Soviet lead representative was a Gorbachev supporter
                    and spoke with great apparent authority and sincerity. The Soviet Ambassador in
                    Costa Rica also belonged to the Gorbachev group; he was very effective and had a
                    good relationship with Arias. I took advantage of being in San Jose to establish
                    a cordial professional relationship with him, which I found interesting and my
                    colleagues in the diplomatic corps found surprising.</p>
                <p>By this time, Ollie North was no longer a factor; he was busy defending himself
                    on the Hill. The Iran-Contra hearings were somewhat disruptive to the workings
                    of the bureaucracy because as policy makers were increasingly involved;
                    gradually, the hearings rose to the top of their agendas requiring considerable
                    work on the part of the staff collecting documents and other background
                    material. The hearings were of considerable concern to officials of other
                    governments because statements were being made—often contradictory—about
                    activities in their countries, some of which they were previously unaware of.
                    There were characterizations of foreign leaders and description of relationships
                    which were unflattering and at times inconsistent. So those hearings did roil
                    the waters; there were embarrassments—to put it mildly.</p>

                <p>MELTON: Soon after returning from Costa Rica, the ambassadorship in Nicaragua was
                    coming open with the scheduled departure of Ambassador Bergold. I was asked
                    whether I would be interested, and I said that indeed I would be. Once my
                    nomination had been sent forward, I left my duties as Office Director and
                    focused on preparation for my hearings. As is becoming increasingly the norm, my
                    nomination was held hostage by the Foreign Relations Committee—and Senator
                    Helms—who wanted certain papers relating to Nicaraguan policy to be handed over
                    by the administration. Those papers had no relationship to me, but the issue
                    became a contest of will between the ranking minority member of the Committee
                    and the administration, which was not willing to release some of the papers.
                    This standoff held up my confirmation for about six months, and I didn't get to
                    Managua until May 1988.</p>
                <p>In anticipation of my confirmation hearings, I went through the usual preparation
                    process. There are several levels of scrutiny depending on whether the country
                    to which one is going is important to the U.S. or in the headlines of the day.
                    If the country is of policy importance—as Nicaragua was—efforts are made to
                    ensure that you see not only the Chairman and ranking minority member of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but as many of the members of the Committee
                    as possible. This gives the Senators an opportunity to express their concerns
                    and for the nominee to get to know them and to exchange some views. I went
                    through the process; I called on Senator Pell and other members of the
                    Committee. It soon became apparent that I would not be the issue in the
                    confirmation process; it was our policy toward Nicaragua which was the issue.
                    Senator Helms, as I said, also sought to use my nomination as a vehicle for
                    extracting certain documents from the Department; he clearly was not as anxious
                    to have a representative in Managua as was the administration. He was willing to
                    block consideration of my nomination for a considerable period of time. And he
                    had the ability to do so.</p>
                <p>Eventually, an accommodation was worked out, primarily because the question of
                    the documents lost much of its significance. I did have a hearing, and my
                    nomination thereafter went through without difficulties. The hearing focused on
                    US policy toward Nicaragua and what we hoped to achieve there, but it was not a
                    heated exchange. Once the issues were laid out, there were no major differences.
                    The argument was more about means than ends. Everybody agreed that strengthening
                    democratic institutions in Nicaragua through elections should be the principal
                    objective.</p>
                <p>By this time, the Arias proposals were gaining momentum. The proposals advanced
                    by House Speaker Wright had come and gone. The fatigue factor increasingly
                    seemed to overwhelm all other considerations. It was clear to all protagonists
                    that neither side would prevail in Nicaragua, at least in achieving their full
                    agenda. Some compromises were necessary, although I think that the Sandinistas
                    felt in control of the situation and believed that they could afford at this
                    point to make compromises, including agreement to new elections. But it was not
                    certain that elections would actually be held or, if held, they would be fair.
                    So there was considerable uncertainty about the future in Nicaragua.</p>

                <p>We of course pushed hard for free, democratic elections. That was my main focus
                    when I arrived in Managua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you served in Nicaragua from May 1988 to July
                        1988.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: That is right. It was a short tour of 90 days. I was declared persona non
                    grata in July. As I said, my focus was on the holding of free, democratic
                    elections. I presented my credentials to Daniel Ortega in the old Nejapa country
                    club, a Somoza favorite, which had been converted by the Sandinistas to a
                    convention center and was used for a variety of ceremonial occasions. I made a
                    brief statement in Spanish about our intent—the strong support for democratic
                    institutions in Nicaragua. After that Ortega and his Foreign Minister sat down
                    and we chatted. I sat between the two Nicaraguans. That was the beginning of a
                    dialogue. My unsuccessful efforts at dialogue with the Sandinistas. I followed
                    up this initial conversation with efforts to make the usual calls on government
                    officials that a new ambassador makes. I asked to see Cabinet Ministers. I had
                    one scheduled and several requests pending when we received word that all my
                    requests for calls had to go through the Foreign Ministry. I resubmitted my
                    requests via diplomatic note, but weeks went by without any meetings being
                    scheduled or any response at all from the Sandinistas.</p>
                <p>I did go around to see leaders of the democratic opposition from all parties. I
                    also saw the press and other elements of society. But the government officials
                    refused to see me. It was obvious that a general policy had been established—I
                    would have to show “good behavior” before contacts would be established. The
                    exception to that rule was a friend that I had made during my previous tour in
                    Nicaragua. By 1988, he had become the head of the Social Security administration
                    and a relatively senior Sandinista official. I had asked for an appointment to
                    see him, which he granted. Later he found out that he had made a mistake. He was
                    a very strong Sandinista, a doctrinaire Marxist; he had been a Christian
                    Democrat, but his views became radicalized—in large part because he had not been
                    able to make much headway under Somoza. So he joined the Sandinistas to fight
                    Somoza. But our old friendship stood the strain between our governments, and we
                    were able to establish a person-to-person dialogue.</p>
                <p>I had several meetings with the Foreign Minister, but the other Sandinistas gave
                    me a wide berth. This was a unique situation which contrasted sharply with the
                    relatively cordial relations the Sandinistas maintained with Ambassador Quainton
                    and Ambassador Bergold. They were received regularly and had no problem
                    conducting business with the government. I think the Sandinistas made a judgment
                    that that was the way they would conduct business with the U.S. at this time.
                    Their assessment of the individuals may also have been a factor, but I would not
                    make too much of this. It is likely they would have treated any US
                    representative in much the same manner.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I was increasingly vilified almost from the first day. The tone in the media
                    became increasingly strident. I was associated with all sorts of Somoza crimes;
                    I read in the Sandinista press that I was virtually Somoza's right hand man
                    during my previous tour—when I was a junior officer. My role in fact was quite
                    the opposite; I was certainly not a fan of Somoza. I think anyone who knew me
                    then—as did my Social Security friend—understood that and knew that I did not
                    sympathize with the Somozas one iota. But the Sandinista press vilified me
                    daily. If this campaign was intended to intimidate me, it missed badly. I
                    continued my efforts to get in touch with the Sandinistas, even as I continued
                    to meet with leaders of the opposition. After my initial meeting with the
                    Foreign Minister, I was referred to the head of the Americas division of the
                    Sandinista Party. I was told that my contacts would be more fruitful with the
                    Party and not the government. I said that would not do; that as representative
                    of a government I would have to deal with the elected authorities and not party
                    officials.</p>
                <p>I did, as I said, see leaders of the democratic parties and I did everything
                    quite openly. As is true in all countries, the host government is responsible
                    for the security of all diplomats accredited to that country. I had several
                    guards riding with me in my vehicle plus a follow car. These guards were
                    provided by the government. The only American guards were the Marines at the
                    Chancery. It would have been very difficult to do anything without the
                    Sandinistas knowing about it. In any case, I wanted to conduct my business quite
                    openly. That transparency became an important factor after the Sandinistas
                    decided to declare me persona non grata and, at the same time, to crack down on
                    the opposition. I was expelled along with six members of my staff. The action
                    that the Sandinistas took was part of a series of actions which they took to
                    crack down on all opposition elements.</p>
                <p>Most of the personal vilification took place in Nicaragua, although occasional
                    anti-Melton pieces appeared in the American press as well. There were daily
                    attacks in the Managua press and weekly demonstrations in front of the Embassy.
                    These demonstrations were part of a regular tour given to visiting Americans by
                    the Sandinistas, who also organized visits to communes and other Sandinista show
                    cases. Some of the Americans would spend time in the rural areas chopping cane,
                    working along side their Sandinista comrades, but on Wednesday they would join
                    the regularly scheduled demonstrations in front of our Chancery. Periodically,
                    we would meet with these Americans, if they asked for appointments. During the
                    demonstrations, I became one of the favorite targets.</p>
                <p>The unwillingness of government officials to see me, unless I was willing to
                    accommodate to norms laid down by the Sandinistas, was part of their approach. I
                    would on occasion be asked why I didn't conduct myself as some of my
                    predecessors had. I frequently spoke with Sandinista officials at receptions and
                    other public events. In group settings, if the Sandinistas said something
                    critical about the US, I would not hesitate to take issue. So I did have some
                    access, and sometimes they would try to bait me. It became almost
                    predictable.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I think the Sandinistas viewed my activities as qualitatively different from
                    those of my predecessors. The circumstances were different since we were in a
                    pre-election period and the opposition was accorded a degree of toleration. The
                    main issues in the Nicaraguan political dynamics were: would there be elections?
                    If so, would the anti-Sandinista parties stand together?—which they had to do if
                    there was any chance of winning. They had to present a unified slate of
                    candidates; multiple slates would have ensured a Sandinista victory.
                    Historically, Nicaragua had divided between liberals and conservatives. But
                    following the Sandinista takeover, traditional alignments had fragmented, and in
                    1988 there were literally dozens of parties. The Sandinistas of course
                    benefitted from this situation and tried their best to keep the democratic
                    opposition parties divided. The Sandinistas held most of the cards. I urged the
                    opposition to work together as the only way for the democrats to win at the
                    polls; I made no secret of my interest in these democratic parties participating
                    in the Nicaraguan political process. In the end, that is the policy that these
                    parties adopted; they did field a unified slate and won the elections, much to
                    the shock of the Sandinistas and the surprise of most foreign observers.</p>
                <p>As I said, early summer 1988 was still in the pre-election period. The
                    Sandinistas had not even made the decision to hold elections. There were some
                    signs that they might agree, but the final decision had not been made. When they
                    finally reached their decision, many factors obviously were weighed. One of
                    them, I believe, was the Sandinistas confidence that they would sweep the
                    elections—without much difficulty. They did not think that the opposition could
                    come together. Agreeing to elections would, moreover, give the Sandinistas a
                    major public relations victory by eliminating one of the major arguments against
                    their regime—that they had not been voted into power in democratic elections.
                    The legitimization of the Sandinistas would, according to this view, at the same
                    time erode the support for the resistance—particularly in the U.S. Congress.</p>
                <p>I had contacts with Violeta Chamorro. She was then and is today a very courageous
                    person. In many respects, she was the essence of Nicaragua. She had the ability
                    to bring factions together—she was unique in that skill. There was very broad
                    spectrum of views within the democratic opposition. Almost every leader had a
                    different approach to political organization and objectives. The U.S. government
                    had divided views as well—even the desire to hold democratic elections was an
                    issue. Not everyone agreed that elections organized by the Sandinistas were a
                    good idea. There was deep skepticism that the elections would be held or that
                    they would be fair even if allowed. There was concern that flawed elections
                    against a divided opposition would just legitimize Sandinista rule—the mirror
                    image of the Sandinista expectation. In the Embassy, we became increasingly
                    convinced that democratic elections should be supported; there was a continuing
                    role for the resistance, but that was primarily to force the Sandinistas to hold
                    elections which would eventually resolve the outstanding political issues. That
                    was our view which we communicated to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>There was also the probability that the resistance, if victorious, might shun the
                    democratic approach and claim the spoils of victory. The resistance had not
                    produced a political cadre; it was a Campesino-based guerrilla army. Some of its
                    commanders and leaders were impressive, but no single leader had emerged—Enrique
                    Bermudez, the top military commander lacked the political skills required. Some
                    of the resistance “stars” had been killed at the beginning of the fighting,
                    including prominent civilian figures. It seemed to me that the political future
                    of Nicaragua, if it were to be resolved through elections, would have to be
                    tackled and decided by local leaders, not by Washington. There were a few
                    potential people, still in Managua, who were not formally part of the
                    resistance, but were associated in people's minds with that movement. These
                    people held the key—they would be the ones to contest the elections.</p>
                <p>The Europeans went through an evolution. I had close contacts with all of the
                    diplomatic corps. The major players—the Germans, the Italians, the Spanish, the
                    Brazilians and some other Europeans—were also anxious to find solutions. The
                    Brazilian Ambassador, Sergio Duarte, was one of the most effective diplomats; he
                    was a perceptive observer who became a good friend for many years, including
                    those I subsequently spent in Brazil as Ambassador. I think that the assessment
                    of the Sandinistas by diplomats who had been in Nicaragua for any length of time
                    surely had evolved. With some exceptions, I think most of the major embassies
                    had become disenchanted; they were seeing the same abuses by the Sandinistas
                    that we had observed. Life was not improving for anyone in Nicaragua—except
                    perhaps the Sandinista top echelon. It was becoming increasing apparent that the
                    Sandinista cadres were behaving very much like the old Somoza cliques. The
                    Sandinista party was a cadre party; at its foundation, there were a hard core
                    that continued to be subsidized by the government. The number of these hard core
                    adherents directly or indirectly on the government's payroll—perhaps as many as
                    200,000—was almost large enough to ensure that elections would be a foregone
                    conclusion. So the Sandinistas were very much a vanguard party, despite
                    protestations to the contrary. The evils and excesses that flow from an ingrown
                    political system were certainly evident in 1988 for foreign observers and
                    increasingly to the Nicaraguans.</p>
                <p>This disenchantment was felt by the diplomats almost regardless of their personal
                    ideology. The living conditions in Nicaragua were not improving and not all of
                    the problems could be blamed on external forces. The assistance that was being
                    provided by many of their countries was not being used effectively, Sandinista
                    management of the country left much to be desired, corruption was growing,
                    vehicles and machinery were rusting from disuse. Countries that had active
                    projects in Nicaragua, like the Germans, were becoming disillusioned and
                    concerned; they were not willing to provide additional assistance when much of
                    what they had already given was being wasted.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Shortly after our July 4 reception, at which I made a brief, but general
                    pro-democracy statement, I was declared persona non grata. So I was in Nicaragua
                    for 90 event packed days. I must say I was somewhat surprised by the Sandinista
                    action. The Sandinistas had accepted me to be the U.S. Ambassador; they knew—or
                    should have known—what they were getting. My views and positions, and those of
                    my government, were no secret. The Sandinista decision to expel me and members
                    of the Embassy staff, I believe, was a part of a broader crack down on the
                    opposition: closing of La Prensa, the main opposition newspaper in Nicaragua;
                    shutting down the last major private enterprise, a large mill; imprisonment of
                    opposition leaders. The immediate cause for these repressive measures was an
                    opposition demonstration in Diriamba, a small town near Managua. The Sandinistas
                    alleged that the U.S. Embassy had orchestrated that demonstration. We had heard
                    that the opposition would gather there to hold a demonstration. We had also been
                    told that the police would be there in force, which suggested that there might
                    be some clashes. At the time, there was a Congressional delegation visiting
                    Managua. I advised them against going to Diriamba—I was concerned about their
                    safety, but several members of Congress went nevertheless. Since they were
                    insistent on going, I sent the Embassy security officer with them. They went in
                    Embassy vehicles. The photographs that were published the next day in the
                    Sandinista press prominently featured the security officer, arm raised in front
                    of him. The caption stated that he was orchestrating the demonstration. What he
                    was actually doing was motioning to the Congressional delegation trying to get
                    them back into the vehicles to get away from the confrontations. The caption
                    under the photograph read: “US official directing opposition demonstration in
                    Diriamba.” That was manifestly untrue and an outrageous distortion. The
                    Sandinistas must have known that this was a complete fabrication, but they
                    seized upon it as the protest for their expulsion action.</p>
                <p>The staff that was expelled included most of the Embassy's reporting officers. We
                    had a small Embassy, and the Sandinistas cleaned out the Political and Economic
                    Sections. The way the expulsions were announced was interesting. Without advance
                    notice, I was summoned to the Foreign Ministry—I received the call at about 3
                    p.m. to be at the Foreign Ministry in an hour. When asked what the meeting was
                    to be about, the caller was very evasive. We had heard that the press had been
                    notified that an event would take place at the Foreign Ministry at 4 p.m. That
                    information, along with other tidbits, led us to believe that I was going to be
                    subject of the “event.” So I called back and said I would be there, but that I
                    did not intend to be part of a media circus staged by the Sandinistas. I was
                    assured that this was not their intent.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>We did some checking around and I became increasingly certain that in fact I
                    would be the center of a “political event.” When I arrived, I was ushered in to
                    see the Foreign Minister and his deputy. They went through the Diriamba affair
                    and other alleged offenses against Nicaraguan sovereignty. The diatribe ended
                    with a statement that I and other Embassy officers were being declared persona
                    non grata. I felt that there was no purpose served by trying to argue the case.
                    The decision had clearly been made at the highest level. I said only that the
                    action was not warranted and that I thought the regime was making a major
                    mistake—but that was their problem as subsequent events demonstrated. And I
                    left. They did hold a press conference at the Foreign Ministry and vilified the
                    U.S. and me some more. I reported the action taken by the Sandinistas; I then
                    talked to the staff and went to the Residence to pack up.</p>
                <p>I then got word from Washington that a plane would be sent to pick me up. I flew
                    out that night on a US Air Force aircraft, stopped in Miami overnight and the
                    next day I had an appointment with President Reagan—after an hour's sleep. I met
                    with the President, Vice President Bush and Secretary of State Shultz and we
                    talked about what had happened. They agreed that the Sandinistas had taken an
                    outrageous action. They were aware of my performance in Nicaragua. By sending a
                    plane for me and by meeting with the President on the next day, they were
                    sending a message of full support for me—which I welcomed. I think the
                    Department has not always been fully supportive of our representatives who have
                    been declared persona non grata merely for carrying out policy and doing their
                    job; it has shown ambivalence at times in such situations. US diplomats who have
                    been expelled have often found that the Department has distanced itself from the
                    individual and left him or her twisting in the wind—never to be heard from
                    again. I find that approach hard to accept; if someone is expelled for good
                    reason, then coolness, or even disciplinary action may be in order. But if
                    someone is expelled for discharging his or her responsibilities as directed by
                    Washington, then the U.S. government should support that individual, as it did
                    in my case.</p>
                <p>The six staff members expelled with me were treated well. George Shultz and
                    Elliott Abrams insisted that these individuals were given good onward
                    assignments, and they were. They have all done well in their careers. There was
                    some discussion about retaliatory actions, ranging from breaking relations to
                    much less punitive measures. I argued against breaking relations because I
                    believed that, because the Sandinistas had done something foolish, the U.S.
                    should not follow the same path. The democratic opposition, under increased
                    pressure from the Sandinistas, needed the support which an Embassy could provide
                    more than ever. The decision was made in Washington that we would respond in
                    kind—expelling their Ambassador and some of their senior diplomats in
                    Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>As we walked out of the room where I had met with the President, White House
                    spokesman Marlin Fitzwater turned to me and said, “By the way, there is some
                    press waiting to hear from you. You don't mind, do you?” He took me into the
                    press briefing room; it was full—Sam Donaldson, Helen Thomas, and all the rest.
                    It became a full-fledged press conference with me as the “attraction of the
                    day.” I fielded a wide range of questions, mostly focusing on what I had done
                    and whether the expulsion was justified, as claimed by the Sandinistas. It went
                    well, but it was a demanding experience.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, I was asked to appear before several Congressional committees to
                    explain what had happened in Managua; I was accompanied by Elliott Abrams.
                    Initially, some of the questioning was quite critical, appearing to accept the
                    assumption that I was expelled because I had done something wrong. I explained
                    in considerable detail what I had done during my 90 days as Ambassador,
                    including things which might have given offense to the Sandinistas. I quoted
                    from the speech—which the Sandinistas found objectionable—I had given at the
                    annual Embassy July 4 reception. I had invited a number of the senior
                    Sandinistas to attend—only a token representative appeared. But most of the
                    major opposition political leaders were there and many members of the diplomatic
                    corps as well. My comments included strong pronouncements supporting democracy,
                    freedom, and individual liberty. I included quotes from George Washington,
                    Abraham Lincoln, and Thomas Jefferson. The Sandinistas may have considered these
                    quotes to be inflammatory; the U.S. Congress did not. The hearings, particularly
                    the Senate one, remains indelibly stamped in my mind. As the U.S. Ambassador in
                    Nicaragua, I was actively representing my country. For this, I was expelled by
                    the host government and brought before a Congressional Committee in a proceeding
                    which seemed to me to be based on the assumption that I had done something
                    wrong. At least that appeared to me to be the perspective of some of the
                    Senators—but not all by any means. In the course of the hearing, I had an
                    opportunity to explain what had really happened—including the July 4 speech,
                    which some of the members had been provided to ask about, presumably by
                    opponents of US policy. As I said, I was able to satisfy the Senators about the
                    content of my speech and that my activities in Managua had been entirely
                    transparent. I brought with me copies of the many diplomatic notes that I had
                    sent requesting appointments with every Sandinista cabinet officer. I noted that
                    in some cases, I had received negative replies; in most cases no answer at
                    all.</p>
                <p>As I laid out my case, the atmosphere in the hearing room changed perceptibly. In
                    the end, I think the hearings turned out to be quite positive. But the
                    experience of facing some hostile American Senators carrying negative
                    presumptions about the work that I had done in Nicaragua was an eye-opener.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The Administration focused on whether there should be a change in our Nicaraguan
                    policy in the aftermath of my expulsion. The issue was whether we should
                    continue to maintain political pressure for a democratic solution to the
                    Nicaraguan crisis via elections or were there other more direct steps that might
                    be taken—increased military pressure—or should the U.S. just write Nicaragua
                    off? I think wisdom prevailed—we continued on the course we were embarked. It
                    was evident to me that the resistance was an essential element of pressure
                    needed to force and accept democratic elections. There were some within the U.S.
                    government who believed that the Sandinistas would give up power only if they
                    were defeated militarily by resistance forces. I continued to believe that
                    military pressure from the resistance was needed, but that the unified
                    democratic opposition parties in Managua now had been the key to bringing
                    democracy to the country. That was the view that finally prevailed, but I don't
                    think there was ever unanimous support for it in the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to you after the initial whirlwind in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: I spent the first few weeks answering questions. I appeared on “Night
                    Line” and other television talk shows as well as radio shows. Then I had to face
                    what to do next. I was asked by Abrams if I were interested in being a deputy
                    assistant secretary in ARA, responsible for Mexico, the Caribbean and regional
                    economical affairs. I told him that indeed I would be—it was a challenging
                    portfolio. So I took that job. I did that from 1988 to 1989—six to nine
                    months.</p>
                <p>In 1988, we were entering an election period in the United States. Abrams was
                    beginning to feel the heat coming out of the Iran-Contra investigation. After
                    the election, we had a change in assistant secretaries with Bernie Aronson
                    replacing Abrams and Baker replaced Shultz. Abrams was under increasing pressure
                    by the special prosecutor as were other senior members of the ARA State, both in
                    Washington and the field, who might have been involved in the Contra support
                    operation. It was a difficult period for all of those individuals, but the work
                    of the bureau went on. I talked to representatives of the special prosecutor
                    several times—that was an unusual experience for a career Foreign Service
                    officer. I would not recommend that to anyone else to have that experience, but
                    I did learn a lot about what Ollie North and others had really been doing to
                    support the Contras. A number of my colleagues hired lawyers. I did not. I had
                    done nothing wrong, so why would I require counsel. There was also a question of
                    payment. One does get reimbursement for legal expenses if no negative action is
                    taken against you, but even though you are a government official, you are
                    essentially on your own. The State Department's legal advisor's office defends
                    the institution—not its members—which I found an interesting concept—even when a
                    prosecutor's interest in what you might have done in the line of duty. In fact,
                    whether an officer conducted himself or herself properly in the course of
                    performing official duties is judged ex post facto—which in itself poses some
                    interesting dilemmas. The question of whether someone who is being deposed by a
                    special prosecutor should need legal counsel was very real for me. I did not
                    hire a lawyer.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>I spoke to the prosecutors about things that I knew first hand and that I did.
                    But my task was relatively easy because all of the things I had done and knew
                    about were a matter of record. I was asked about some of the statements in memos
                    I had written. I also discussed the organization of the bureau and how the
                    policy making and implementation processes worked. I was not the focus of the
                    prosecutor's attention; I was on the fringes, but I was close enough to see the
                    effect the process had on the lives of those who were targets. I am not saying
                    that the process is wrong—checks and balances are essential—but I certainly
                    noted the toll it took on people. I later read Elliott Abrams' book; it
                    documents well the emotional distress accompanying the process.</p>
                <p>As far as my new job was concerned, one interesting aspect of it was that the
                    administration had rediscovered Mexico. The focus was generated by Jim Baker who
                    became Secretary of State in 1989. The center of our policy implementation
                    became the binational commission which met annually. First, we had to review the
                    record to see what the “US/Mexico binational commission” was and how it had been
                    used in the past. It had not been active for some years and both we and Mexicans
                    had to do some homework in order to resuscitate it. It has now become the norm;
                    it meets at Cabinet level annually—sometimes attended by the two Presidents—to
                    review the status of our bilateral relations. 1989 was pre-NAFTA (North American
                    Free Trade Agreement); the concept was not yet politically acceptable in
                    Mexico—it would have been viewed as another attempt by the U.S. to swallow
                    Mexico. It is interesting to note that this is the direct opposite view of that
                    held by the AFL/CIO which views NAFTA as a serious threat to American labor.</p>
                <p>So in this period there was a new awareness of the importance of the relationship
                    with Mexico across the board. Drug issues were becoming increasingly important;
                    DEA agent Enrique Camarena would soon be murdered; Elaine Shannon had just
                    published her book arguing that we subordinated our drug policy to large foreign
                    policy considerations. All of that headline material gave the drug problem more
                    relevance. We worried about corruption and the responsibility Mexican
                    authorities had for the problem—the same range of issues that are discussed now
                    in deciding whether to certify Mexico as a cooperative partner in the war on
                    drugs. We had considerable hope because it was clear that Mexico was embarked on
                    a major economic development program—liberalization and modernization. But this
                    was only part of the picture. Overall, Mexico loomed larger on the regional and
                    global agenda. The negative aspects of the Salinas administration was not as
                    clear in 1989 as they later became.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>We had some concern about the Mexican political system. One of the issues was
                    whether the historically dominant party, the PRI, was becoming more open. Would
                    the opposition parties be permitted to compete on an equal basis with the PRI?
                    Would the election results be honored? The border industries—the
                    Maquiladoras—and the growing cross border economy and cooperation already showed
                    signs of influencing the Mexican political structure by loosening the hold of
                    PRI on the levers of power. Election results were concrete evidence of this
                    change, with the PRI being under increasing pressure; the change was palpable;
                    the only question was whether the PRI would honor the election results. The
                    process in the border regions was viewed as a precursor of possible change in
                    all of Mexico, both politically and economically.</p>
                <p>The economic liberalization program was impressive. There were concerns about its
                    staying power, although the evidence seemed clear that it would persist. As I
                    suggested, we had hoped that that economic development would bring political
                    change in Mexico. We were encouraged by early progress, but the outcome was not
                    clear. The tensions between President Salinas and some of the traditional PRI
                    leaders suggested that the political system might well open up. The PRI
                    oligarchy didn't want to honor election results; they didn't want transparency
                    in government operations. As people began to see the possibility of opening the
                    Mexican political system, they also became more interested in raising the
                    US/Mexican relationships higher on the U.S. foreign policy agenda.</p>
                <p>It was of course very useful that two Texans—President Bush and Secretary
                    Baker—were in charge of the U.S. foreign policy process; they were interested
                    and had considerable background in Mexican issues. One of President Bush's
                    daughters-in-law is Mexican. When I went to Mexico as a member of the U.S.
                    delegation to the inauguration of President Salinas, that son was a member of
                    the delegation. The first meeting that newly-elected President Bush had with a
                    foreign dignitary was with Mexican President Salinas.</p>
                <p>The Binational Commission handled many of the very sticky problems that affect
                    cross-border relationships—many of them in the environmental area. These
                    included water rights and distribution, sanitation, and pollution. These issues
                    are of great interest to the Congressional delegations from the border states as
                    well as to the governors of the adjacent Mexican states. Bush and Baker, both
                    being from Texas, were quite familiar with these issues and understood their
                    importance. So when the issues arose, in anticipation of the annual meeting of
                    the Commission, they were taken very seriously in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>In the Caribbean, Haiti was already a major issue. “Baby Doc” Duvalier had been
                    deposed and the country was under the rule of General Avril. Our efforts were
                    directed to stimulating democratic elections so that the country would finally
                    be rid of dictatorships. We devoted much time to this effort, but the same
                    issues with which Americans became subsequently familiar were already present in
                    Haiti in 1989. There was an underlying question of how much influence the U.S.
                    really had with the corrupt military and para-military groups which had ruled
                    Haiti for so long. The military was not interested in who ruled; it only worried
                    about who got the spoils. It was a collection of loosely organized gangs which
                    competed in the looting of the country. It was not disciplined enough to avoid
                    bloodshed, even if it was in their interest to do so. It is very difficult to
                    have any impact in a military organization in which the generals were afraid of
                    their troops; frequently when officers made decisions, they would be immediately
                    countermanded by a parallel group in the next room who were monitoring their
                    actions.</p>
                <p>So the extent of US influence was very much in question. We had no leverage with
                    the troops, and the commanders could not deliver on any commitments. We could
                    revoke visas, for example, but that was hardly sufficient to bring enough
                    pressure on Haiti to make a change in their political practices. The economy was
                    already in such trouble that additional economic sanctions had little impact.
                    Furthermore, there was always a question of whether all the elements of the U.S.
                    government would cooperate to implement the policies set by US leadership. That
                    was not as easy as it sounds; you might be told one thing, when in fact the
                    opposite was true. Or if a decision is made, it had to be followed up on to make
                    sure it was implemented. There were US personnel of other agencies who had
                    relationships in Haiti which were not shared with others; information was not
                    volunteered and those that should have known about it were not always informed.
                    We have since made some progress on these problems, but in 1989 these were real
                    barriers.</p>
                <p>One of the key issues of the day was whether Congress would appropriate resources
                    to help Haiti's political transition. For example, we had to wrestle with the
                    famous “Flour Mill” case. It was clear that the country's largest flour mill was
                    a source of patronage and corruption. But it was also the base for providing
                    bread for the poor. There were legitimate reasons for not providing resources
                    for this project, but by withholding funds I think we overlooked larger US
                    interests at play in Haiti. The objective of those blocking funds may well have
                    been laudable—i.e. privatization—but at the same time we had to be concerned
                    with the general welfare of the population in addition to supporting a political
                    transition with widespread bloodshed. These goals needed the support of the
                    Congress; we needed PL 480 funds as well as other resources to provide this
                    needed assistance. We found that Congress was not willing to appropriate the
                    necessary resources in part, I believe, because we could not get sufficient
                    attention focused on Haiti within the Executive Branch. I think the price we
                    paid for neglect of Haiti in 1989 was a much greater expenditure in resources a
                    few years later. The problem at the end of the 1980s was, in significant part,
                    one of indifference. That was unfortunate because I think that a modest amount
                    of assistance, given with some flexibility, in 1989 might well have prevented
                    the tragedy of the mid-1990s.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Economic conditions, plus continuing repression, resulted in a large exodus of
                    people—the “boat” people. The same thing can be said about Mexico. If there are
                    inadequate employment opportunities in a country, people show their displeasure
                    by leaving. In the short term, the Haitian authorities as part of a general
                    agreement with the United States had indicated a willingness to take back their
                    nationals who sought to enter the United States illegally. This was also to our
                    interest. We had to ensure that those returned would not be subjected to human
                    rights abuses; i.e. that returning refugees would be treated humanely. This
                    called for some subjective judgments; to our credit, we have some major
                    organizations in the U.S. dedicated to the welfare of refugees. They form
                    pressure groups which favor liberal immigration into the US. They look for the
                    broadest possible interpretation of the term “political refugee.” Anyone who
                    leaves his or her country is presumably eligible for that status, according to
                    some of these groups. On the other side, the persuasive argument was made that
                    the Haitians were economic not political refugees—that is, they were not leaving
                    because they were being persecuted.</p>
                <p>In the final analysis, the U.S. government undertook to monitor the Haitians who
                    were repatriated to ensure that they would not be persecuted. If there was a
                    pattern of abuse following repatriations, then we would have reconsidered this
                    policy. The evidence that was collected did indeed suggest that the vast
                    majority of Haitian refugees were essentially economic and were not subjected to
                    persecution upon their return to their homes.</p>
                <p>Although Cuba was not within my area of responsibility, Cuba was a significant
                    player in Central America. We didn't have exactly a fluid dialogue with Castro,
                    but we did have an increasingly productive discussion with the Soviets, some of
                    it about Cuba. I mentioned earlier that we started annual meetings with the
                    Soviets on Latin American issues. We told them that we would continue our policy
                    of isolation towards Cuba, and emphasized that Cuba was becoming an increasing
                    economic burden for the USSR which could probably not be sustained. We suggested
                    that they cut their losses and reduce their support to Cuba; it was a battle
                    that they could not win in the long run. Eventually, they reached the same
                    conclusion as their economic straits became more and more dire. The Soviets did
                    abandon Cuba which had considerable impact on the economy of that country and
                    its ability to support insurrection elsewhere in the region. It forced Castro to
                    return his people to more primitive conditions rather than opening the economy
                    and running the risk of losing political power. I don't think anyone ever felt
                    that the outcome would be any different; Castro was not going to give up
                    power.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Cuba stood in contrast to the rest of Latin America. The economic situation on
                    the continent looked optimistic. We were looking for ways to mitigate the
                    consequences of the large debt “overhang.” We were in close touch with the U.S.
                    banks that held most of that debt. Our regional economic office was staffed with
                    some very innovative people; we had good relationships with Treasury and the
                    Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. We came up with some creative proposals
                    to ease the debt problem. The banks were heavily exposed and were looking for
                    ways to share that exposure—particularly with the U.S. Treasury. Treasury's
                    position, which was endorsed by the government as a whole, was that a weakened
                    US banking system was a risk to the US, to foreign trade, and other global
                    economic goals. So all parties had an interest in finding a solution, not just
                    the banks.</p>
                <p>A fundamental change in the US/Latin America dialogue on this issue came when the
                    Latins showed some willingness to move away from their closed economic
                    systems—ironically, as was also happening in the Soviet Union. Salinas'
                    successful efforts in Mexico were leading the way to more open economies as were
                    the efforts undertaken in Chile. Movement towards open economies was building in
                    Latin America which now has sealed the fate of state controlled economies. In
                    1989, there were signs of change, even though some parts of the U.S. government
                    were a little slow in recognizing it. Some find it difficult to believe that
                    things can change. There are tensions, such as trade disputes, that sometimes
                    obscure the larger picture—the fundamental changes that are taking place in an
                    economy—and therefore opportunities are missed to expedite the transition.</p>
                <p>The palpable shift in Latin America toward democratic regimes was beginning to
                    draw attention in Washington. Both economic and political maps of the region
                    gave comfort to those who had worked for a region of democratic regimes and
                    market economies. More countries were moving in those directions. The
                    possibility of the return of military dictatorships and closed economies was not
                    discussed anymore. A significant change had taken place in the 1980s. On the
                    negative side, as we all know, if things are moving along well, US attention
                    tends to wane. It takes controversy to attract the attention of the President
                    and the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>During my brief period as deputy assistant secretary, I devoted an increasing
                    amount of time to Haiti and our efforts to foster a transition to a
                    democratically elected government there. It was quite disillusioning to go to
                    Haiti to talk to various leaders including the then President General Avril. He
                    would give us commitments which were broken almost by the time we left the
                    meeting room—as his henchmen, representing the views of the troops housed on the
                    grounds of the presidential palace, would force the General to change his mind.
                    It was very unnerving because his agreement meant very little, and we could
                    therefore not find lasting solutions. The civilian elites supporting Avril would
                    focus on what each of them might get out of a deal; “When are you going to pay
                    for this or that?”—e.g. a pension for Mr. X; a subsidy for enterprise. They
                    wanted a guaranteed outcome; otherwise they would not risk any deviation from
                    the status quo, from which they profited at the expense of the Haitian
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>While the military and para-military bands controlled the use of force,
                    traditional elites pulled the strings behind the scenes. So in light of all of
                    these factions and their very narrow agendas, progress was impossible. “Papa
                    Doc” had left Haiti by this time and was ensconced in France—that was one of the
                    triumphs of US diplomacy; he was shuffled off to France. Father Aristide, the
                    future President, was on the scene, but was little known. He had been a
                    dissident Catholic priest who became a political leader. He had differences with
                    the Cardinal and the establishment church. He became an opposition leader, after
                    being deflocked. But in the absence of an open political system, Aristide had no
                    way of demonstrating his political power. I did not get a chance to meet him,
                    but some of my colleagues knew him quite well. He was not seen as a viable
                    option at the time; he was still decidedly in the second echelon of Haiti's
                    political strata. Furthermore, he had a reputation for being erratic which
                    limited his support among the power brokers in Haiti's emerging democratic
                    sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1989, you were nominated to be our Ambassador to
                        Brazil. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: A few months after my return from Nicaragua, the time came for Bureaus to
                    make their preferences known for upcoming ambassadorial vacancies. A new
                    Assistant Secretary, Bernie Aronson, had come on board, was now leading the
                    Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. I was considered for a number of these
                    vacancies and the conclusion seemed to be that I would be the Bureau's candidate
                    for Peru. That was fine for me, and the long process began. I continued my work
                    as deputy assistant secretary. I got to know Bernie better and better. Somewhere
                    along the line, he decided that he wanted me to stay to be his principal deputy.
                    We talked about that possibility several times. In the meantime, a vacancy had
                    developed in Brazil. After making another effort to convince me to become his
                    principal deputy, Bernie agreed that I should go to Brazil and was delighted to
                    find out that I had been there before and knew Portuguese. So the powers-to-be
                    decided to nominate me for Brazil rather than Peru. That was alright with me,
                    even though I knew that there would be many candidates for one of the most
                    important assignments in Latin America. Some of the candidates were good friends
                    and some thought they were clear shoo-ins. The Bureau's decision to nominate me
                    was a last minute affair; it had the support of people like Larry Eagleburger.
                    So the front runners were swept aside at the last minute; that made for a number
                    of hurt feelings—including among some of my friends who had sought the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>As US attention turned to Latin America in the 1960s, Brazil was recognized as a
                    potential economic and political force which made it somewhat different from the
                    countries in the region. So the Department decided to train some people to be
                    specialists on Brazil, giving them language and area training and several
                    assignments to that country or in Washington working on Brazil matters. Steve
                    Low was one of those officers, as was Alan Watson. The cadres developed in this
                    way helped to provide some continuity to our approach. But by the late 1980s,
                    this group of specialists had long since been disbanded; the systematic effort
                    to develop a corps of Brazilian experts had long dissipated. We continue to pay
                    a price for our loss of foresight in this area.</p>
                <p>I knew something about Brazil having served there and having done some academic
                    work on that country. So I was very happy to return to familiar territory. I
                    arrived in Brazil on December 11, 1989—and stayed for four years to December 15,
                    1993. My confirmation process was again a delayed one—such delays had become
                    almost the norm. Senator Helms and the Foreign Relations Committee routinely
                    held up confirmations for one reason or another. Even after I had been
                    nominated, there was an extensive period when no hearings were held—for much the
                    same reason as with my Nicaragua nomination; i.e. Committee members trying to
                    gain some advantage in their dealings with the administration by holding up
                    nominations. So I sat around for months and months waiting for hearings. Once
                    the hearings were held, the confirmation process went rather rapidly. My
                    involvement in Central America matters was raised in the hearings. The
                    “Washington Office on Latin America” and other critics of our policy distributed
                    materials to Committee members opposing my nomination as an alleged “architect”
                    of our “catastrophic Central America policy.” Then there was a story from Brazil
                    repeating an allegation that I had been present at the interrogation and torture
                    of a political prisoner at the Recife federal police station. That story
                    appeared in the Brazilian press and was noticed in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The Brazilians have an excellent Foreign Service which keeps the government well
                    informed about the State Department and our Foreign Service. They were aware of
                    my involvement in Central America and I think were mildly disturbed by that.
                    When the Recife story came out, they let the story run on to see how it would
                    play out. That was not a normal pattern for the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. At
                    the time, of course, the Brazilian government could have killed the story, if
                    they desired, but in this case, permitted it to run on. I asked a number of
                    people, including our Charg� in Brazil and a former Ambassador, Tony Motley,
                    what might be done about the story—I had learned that in a confirmation process,
                    the candidate has to take an active role if the outcome is to be positive. The
                    advice was that I should respond firmly to this; that was in any case my
                    inclination as well; so I did. Before doing so, I reviewed my reporting messages
                    from that period and found that the only time I went to the federal police
                    station was when I tried to ensure that two American priests, who had been
                    detained, would not be abused by the police. My record in defense of human
                    rights was directly opposite to the allegations coming from Brazil. So I got the
                    Embassy to issue a brief statement to that effect. I was prepared to provide
                    additional information and to bring forth witnesses from Recife on my
                    behalf—including Archbishop Dom Halder Camera. The story faded and the Brazilian
                    government granted the agr�ment.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I suspect that an informed network was at work against me. It
                    consisted of people who had followed Central America for many years; they were
                    activists both in the U.S. and other countries. Somehow my name had become part
                    of their list of “wanted.” Both the Recife story and those given out by the
                    “Washington Office on Latin America” suggest that there was probably some
                    linkage. None of the accusations had any factual basis, and they had no
                    resonance in the Committee once it agreed to consider my nomination and those of
                    others.</p>
                <p>Brazil had gone up and down in importance in the U.S. administrations' foreign
                    policy agenda. Henry Kissinger had paid some attention to Brazil. Prior to that,
                    David Rockefeller had also drawn the government's attention to that country.
                    Going back to WWII, a number of special missions had been sent to the region,
                    including Brazil. But US attention to Brazil had been episodic, at best. We were
                    focusing on a new set of issues in Latin America—now known as global issues—e.g.
                    debt, the environment, non-proliferation and perhaps Mexico, all the Latin
                    American countries were heavily involved in all of these issues.</p>
                <p>There had been a negotiated debt settlement with Mexico which was a breakthrough.
                    Brazil was next in line; it had the largest amount of debt, which impacted on
                    many US banks. Citibank's foreign portfolio, for example, was heavily weighted
                    towards Brazil.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>When I went to Brazil, I had one item on my personal agenda. I was intent in
                    laying to rest the false accusation out of Recife. That was done rather quickly.
                    Although no formal apology was ever made by the accuser, his failure to press
                    the case spoke volumes to the Brazilians. Of greater importance, were the global
                    issues in which Brazil was an important player—debt, trade, nonproliferation
                    (Brazil was a potential nuclear power, had the capacity to produce ICBMs, and
                    was working on a nuclear submarine, and environmental. These were new issues;
                    our past focus on such matters as the democratization of the country had receded
                    to some extent, but remained important.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Brazil just before a runoff in the presidential election. The two
                    candidates were a largely untested centrist Fernando Collor de Mello and Luis
                    Ignacio da Silva of the Workers' Party. At one point, about a month before the
                    second round, the polls unanimously predicted a Lula victory. That raised
                    questions about the impact of such an outcome on US/Brazil relations. But in the
                    end, Collar won the election. That opened up some new dialogue possibilities
                    because he had run on a market-based approach to economics which implied
                    policies quite different from those favored in Brazil for decades. So the future
                    looked promising.</p>
                <p>Let me talk about trade first. Brazil is a world-wide trader—about one third with
                    Latin America, one third with the US, one third with the rest of the world. It
                    has a very diversified market, with a large industrial sector. It produces
                    millions of automobiles and large quantities of other manufactured goods. Brazil
                    was developing its domestic petroleum industry, although it remained a major oil
                    importer. It had a large steel industry. It was the world's largest exporter of
                    orange concentrate, and a major player in the soybean and coffee markets,
                    although coffee had receded in importance. So Brazil was a diversified trader
                    and very important in all international trading regimes.</p>
                <p>Our trade relationships with Brazil traditionally had been highly contentious.
                    Brazil was protectionist in many sectors, barring US companies from competing in
                    some important sectors. It did not protect intellectual property—at least to
                    world standards. It did not generally cooperate with us in international trade
                    negotiations; on the contrary, it frequently opposed us. So the trade
                    relationship was frequently tense and in some aspects the most contentious part
                    of our overall relationship. Brazil was therefore high on USTR's agenda. Our
                    Trade Representative was Carla Hills at the time. She ran US trade policy—not
                    the State or Commerce Departments. The Embassy worked closely with USTR and
                    Ambassador Hills. She visited Brazil frequently and was personally engaged in
                    negotiations and I think was highly effective. She became a well known
                    personality in Brazil in light of her outspoken efforts to open Brazilian
                    markets.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Ambassador Hills was deeply involved in steel trade discussions. Brazil is a
                    major steel producer. There is an increasing dichotomy in steel production, with
                    the U.S. moving increasingly towards specialty steels. Brazil has followed that
                    pattern as well and is a tough competitor in the specialty steel market. The
                    issue was one of pricing: was Brazil marketing its products at such low costs to
                    warrant the charge of “dumping?” The statistics showed that Brazil was violating
                    GATT rules by “dumping” its products in the U.S. markets. But it was a difficult
                    case, in that Brazilian subsidies were less to a specific industry than to the
                    Brazilian manufactured goods produced for export.</p>
                <p>There's a similar issue relating to citrus products. Intellectual property
                    protection was the third major trade issue. Piracy of all kinds was growing in
                    Brazil. Brazil represents a large market for American films and videos.
                    Performances by US entertainers were being reproduced and sold both in Brazil
                    and overseas without payment of royalties. We were successful in negotiating an
                    agreement with Brazil on intellectual property, although it took several years
                    to get it done. Because we made progress, Brazil's unacceptable behavior in the
                    intellectual property area did not attract nearly as much attention as, for
                    example, our similar problems with China.</p>
                <p>The determination of whether a country is “dumping” is complicated. The process
                    is prescribed by US law. The examination of an alleged violation is initiated by
                    a complaint from an American manufacturer, who claims he has been damaged. That
                    is followed by a fact finding period, during which all parties submit
                    data—including the accused foreign manufacturer. That raises the question of
                    sovereignty; Brazil—and others—contended that the prices charged by its
                    producers was Brazil's business and not to be regulated by rules unilaterally
                    established by the United States. Those countries maintained that we were
                    violating their sovereignty, as well as established international norms, and
                    declined to participate in the fact finding part of the process. Soon, they
                    found that such a stance was not in their interest and Brazilian industries
                    began to participate. After the presentation of data by all sides, a judgment
                    would be rendered by an independent US regulatory body. Parts of the process are
                    highly sensitive because, as a regulatory process, the parties are enjoined from
                    using certain kinds of representations—those that might be considered as
                    interference in a regulatory function. That made the process even more difficult
                    for a foreign manufacturer.</p>
                <p>A way out of this, of course, was through the establishment of an international
                    process for the adjudication of such trade disputes, acceptable to all parties.
                    GATT processes proved to be too weak. Its successor, the World Trade
                    Organization, represents another attempt.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Coffee had historically been a source of contention, but by the late 1980s, it
                    was far less important than before. Coffee did not account any longer for a
                    major share of Brazil's exports. Efforts had been made for many years to bring
                    some stability to the market; Brazil, as one of the major producers, had an
                    interest in such stability. We had the example of the Organization of Petroleum
                    Exporters, countries which had been a relatively successful cartel—for the first
                    time. The Brazilians continued to harbor the hope that they could duplicate that
                    precedent in the coffee area. The key was Colombia; if Brazil and Colombia could
                    work together, the Brazilians thought that they would have the lion's share of
                    the market and could then manage prices. Coffee producers, however, are not
                    single minded on pricing which is one of the main reasons cartels don't often
                    work—they lack the necessary discipline. There are various kinds of coffee, and
                    countries tend to specialize in one variety or another, either in the “boutique”
                    market or the mass market. The kind of coffee that usually is found in instant
                    coffee comes most often from Africa. Brazil produces all kinds of coffee;
                    Colombia focuses on specialty beans at the high-end of the market. Those
                    variations tend to drive various countries into positions different from those
                    of their fellow producers. Brazil, within the international coffee
                    organizations, has always attempted to bring the factions together. We as the
                    largest consuming nation had worked out an accommodation with the international
                    coffee organization. But during my tour in Brazil these arrangements broke down.
                    The producers fell in disarray and lost their production discipline—the
                    Brazilian and the Colombians couldn't reach agreement. The consumers were also
                    not united; at one extreme, the Japanese would pay whatever they were asked;
                    they were less concerned about price than they were that the producers would
                    grow the beans which they consumed. The Japanese were the major market for the
                    best beans. The international coffee organization finally reached a crisis
                    point; the producers overplayed their hand and we essentially let all
                    arrangements and agreements expire.</p>
                <p>That was not a catastrophic outcome for the Brazilians because, well before this
                    period, coffee had lost much of its relative importance in the Brazilian
                    economy. We in the Embassy, through USTR, were very much involved in the final
                    stages trying to reach an accommodation with Brazil within the international
                    coffee organization. The U.S. negotiator was Myles Frechette, who had been
                    Consul General in Sao Paulo before going to work for Carla Hills. As it turned
                    out, Frechette turned out to be the key US player during the unsuccessful end
                    game. There were a few things such as research that remained after the
                    expiration for a transition period, but essentially the international coffee
                    organization and its attendant arrangements no longer controlled the global
                    coffee market.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Let me talk about debt a little bit. Brazil was the largest debtor to the U.S.
                    banks. There was a vast amount of global debt, but much of it was not owed to
                    American institutions. Our concern was two fold: the impact of the debt by
                    developing countries and the potential impact repudiation of the debt might
                    carry for the international financial system. The international financial system
                    had made its own internal adjustments necessary to prevent a global crisis. So,
                    by the late 1980s, that was a less pressing concern. The impact that this debt
                    had on the financial health of specific US banks with major exposure in Brazil,
                    however, remained worrisome. The banks had reached accommodations with Mexico,
                    leaving Brazil as the major problem. The U.S. government—the Treasury—placed a
                    solution to Brazil's debt very high on its agenda. I worked with David Mulford
                    who was the Under Secretary of the Treasury responsible for the debt problem.
                    Mulford came to Brazil even before the inauguration of President Collor, after
                    the second round of Brazil elections—there is in Brazil as there is in the U.S.
                    a short delay between the final elections and the taking of power by the elected
                    government. We met in private with the Finance Minister-designate, Zelia de
                    Mello and President Collor. We tried to lay the ground work for a cooperative
                    relationship which would encourage a settlement of the debts. The settlement was
                    of course essentially between private American banks and the government of
                    Brazil, which was the guarantor of the debt. But of course there was a question
                    of the role of the U.S. government—Treasury. It was clear that an agreement
                    would require US government support, but at the same time it should not be at
                    the expense of the U.S. taxpayer. The government could promote a dialogue and
                    there were certain actions that it could take to guarantee the final
                    arrangement. But there were other, more direct actions that Treasury could take
                    which would have cost the U.S. taxpayer more than might have been acceptable. So
                    there was a line which the U.S. Treasury could not cross, despite Brazil's and
                    bank's understandable interest in having a third party—the U.S.
                    government—absorb a substantial part of the costs and risks that an agreement
                    might entail. So there were three parties involved in the negotiations all with
                    somewhat different agendas. After a long tortuous process, agreement eventually
                    was reached. There were many ups and downs and many highly emotional sessions
                    attended by Brazilian financial experts and the American banks, usually led by
                    Citibank which had the highest exposure. We served as facilitators rather than
                    as participants in the negotiations. The Embassy monitored closely all
                    negotiations with Brazil, even when the Embassy was not the lead US government
                    institution. We had a Treasury attach� in the Embassy; I fought long and hard
                    with David Mulford to keep him in Brasilia—Treasury was looking to make some
                    personnel cuts and had targeted its man in Brazil as one of the potential
                    savings. I did manage to get a six months extension, but I was not able to save
                    the position in the long run, once the debt issue was settled.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Let me turn to environmental issues. The focal point, which came about mid-term
                    of my tour, was the UN Conference on the Environment which took place in Rio in
                    1992. Almost from the day I arrived in 1989, we were pointing towards that
                    conference. We wanted to ensure not only that we made progress on global
                    environmental issues, but that this be done on effective and practical ways. We
                    wanted to prevent the conference from becoming just another forum for the Third
                    World to hit the developed countries over the head—figuratively speaking. Too
                    many global conferences had determined that all the woes of the developing
                    countries were the fault of the developed countries. So all problems in the
                    developing countries should be paid for by the developed countries. Conferences
                    that had been in that mode were well known for their lack of success. We were
                    trying to make sure that the Rio conference would focus on solutions which could
                    actually be implemented.</p>
                <p>The fact that the conference was to be held in Rio gave Brazil, as the host
                    country, a vital role not only in the management of the proceedings, but in
                    setting the agenda and determining the issues to be discussed. Brazil was
                    expected to bring things together, as host countries had done
                    traditionally—although no such formal role had ever been assigned to them.
                    Brazil has a very capable Foreign Service, with a global perspective. Brazilian
                    diplomats are at home in multilateral forums. Rio proved no exception.</p>
                <p>The central issue was global warming. The key was to reach some accommodation
                    with the Chinese which was and is—and very likely will continue to be—a major
                    global “polluter.” It unfortunately uses a lot of soft coal which is
                    environmentally damaging fuel. So the focus was to try to find some solution
                    which would commit China to reducing its output of environmentally damaging
                    gases. In exchange, the developed countries, including the United States, would
                    make parallel commitments.</p>
                <p>Other countries were focusing on the U.S. and our practices—in part to divert
                    attention from their own shortcomings. The view of the developing world was that
                    the developed countries were trying to force the approval of rules which would
                    be economically disadvantageous to the Third World—since the developed world had
                    already gone through the environmentally-damaging stages of economic development
                    that the developing countries were experiencing at the time. The developed
                    countries, according to this view, had already used and discarded the basic
                    technologies which were often the highest polluters. The developing countries
                    which were using these technologies resented any efforts to force them to use
                    more expensive and less polluting technologies. Of course, these newer
                    technologies were manufactured in developed countries, further adding to the
                    paranoia of the developing countries which saw this environmental thrust as a
                    new form of colonialism and imperialism designed to block their development.
                    This line found resonance in many parts of the world. So we had to find
                    practical solutions to specific issues to try to avoid this ideological
                    discussion.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>We made progress; the conference agenda was shaping up. There was a question of
                    whether the U.S. would participate at all in the conference because of the
                    confrontational stance on the part of some of the participants. Finally, the
                    decision was made that the U.S. would participate. The Environmental Protection
                    Agency Administrator Bill Riley was appointed as the lead US negotiator. He had
                    been the President of the World Wildlife Foundation; so he had good credentials
                    with the environmental community. He came to Brazil on several previous
                    occasions, and he had friends in Brazilian non-governmental environmental
                    organizations. I got to know him quite well, and we worked together on
                    conference preparations.</p>
                <p>The U.S. had a number of environmental projects in its very modest assistance
                    program. We used NGOs primarily to implement these projects. Brazil had been
                    “graduated” from the list of countries receiving assistance; the small residual
                    USAID program tended to focus on global issues like family planning and the
                    environment. That gave us some good contacts in the field in Brazil.</p>
                <p>We worked mostly with Bill Riley on preparing for the conference, but we also
                    worked directly with our UN delegation in NY. The global climate change
                    conventions that were due to be ratified became the key issues for the U.S.
                    delegation. The drafts still left some serious problems for us, such as
                    intellectual property rights which were not adequately protected as far as we
                    were concerned. Bill Riley recognized that failure to reach agreement would be a
                    serious blow to US prestige, particularly in the environmental community. He
                    used all of his skills to find an accommodation. He came to Rio on the eve of
                    the conference to see what could be done; we went to talk to the Brazilians.
                    They also wanted an agreement to make sure that the conference would be deemed a
                    success and that could only happen if the U.S. signed the center piece
                    convention on global climate change. The Brazilians had come much nearer on many
                    of the issues and were prepared to work with us to secure an acceptable
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Months before the conference the decision was made that the President would
                    attend, regardless of the outcome of the conference. There had been a debate in
                    Washington on whether the President should come, given that our signature on the
                    treaty was unlikely. President Bush decided—quite rightly, I believe—that the
                    issues to be debated at the conference were major global matters. The U.S. had a
                    legitimate concern about signing an agreement which didn't have adequate
                    protection for American-developed intellectual property. While we kept trying to
                    negotiate a fairer arrangement, not to have participated in a global conference
                    which was attended by almost every nation would have been an abdication of the
                    leadership role that we had sought to play. In the end we did not get agreement,
                    and President Bush paid a price for this in the 1992 elections. I still think
                    that an agreement acceptable to us could have been reached except for that one
                    unfortunate episode. Even after that, there were efforts to try to breach the
                    differences, but they were doomed to failure. By that time, there was no
                    mediators left.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I had very good contacts in the Foreign Ministry and in the Brazilian government
                    in general. Bill Riley worked with those contacts, especially with the Secretary
                    General who was the policy manager of the Foreign Ministry—a senior career
                    Foreign Service officer. We had a long meeting before the other delegations
                    arrived in Rio. We developed the outline of an accommodation which would have
                    allowed us to sign the agreements. Bill Riley sent back a NODIS (no
                    distribution) message to the White House in which he spelled out the potential
                    accommodation. The next day, that message was on the front page of The New York
                    Times. It had been leaked by the opponents of accommodation in Washington.</p>
                <p>The story created great shockwaves in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. It had been
                    working discreetly behind the scenes, and their work had been exposed by that
                    article. No negotiator wants to be on the front page of any newspaper, much less
                    The New York Times before an agreement has been reached. That article had the
                    effect the opponents intended; it blew the agreement out of the water. There was
                    no possibility after publication of reaching an accommodation. As is typical in
                    such cases, no one admitted that they had leaked. The administration promised to
                    find the culprit in 24 hours; there was the appearance of great concern and
                    activity, but of course no one was ever punished. It was clear in this case, and
                    in many others, that there were only a few people who had access to the leaked
                    information, it should not have been that difficult to find the culprit. But, at
                    least publicly, no one was ever charged.</p>
                <p>US representatives, myself included, apologized profusely for this breach of
                    confidence, but that did not prevent, for the rest of the conference, a chill
                    spreading over relationships with people with whom we had been close. Riley was
                    beside himself; he was greatly embarrassed by this episode and considered what
                    his own actions should be. President Bush called Riley to try to calm the
                    waters; he graciously brought Mrs. Riley with him to Rio on Air Force One. He
                    tried to deal with the situation so that he would not lose Riley's services and
                    still salvage something out of the conference. We continued to look for
                    accommodations; when the President arrived in Rio, he began a series of
                    consultations with the most interested parties, including the NGOs, in order to
                    try to find a formulation which would allow the U.S. to agree to some kind of
                    arrangement. But ultimately, a formula could not be found; the lines had been
                    drawn too sharply. In retrospect, I think an agreement could have been reached
                    had it not been for that leak.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The rainforest is the symbol of Brazil's environmental importance as well as its
                    problems. The rainforest is important because of its impact on global warming;
                    it is a huge area that falls primarily, but not exclusively, within Brazil's
                    borders. The forest is the home for many species of animal life and fauna, some
                    to be found there only. It helps replenish the world's oxygen supply and absorbs
                    pollutants. As the rainforest is depleted—by timber cutting and
                    burning—environmentalists are concerned that this will impact on global warming
                    by reducing the amount of pollutants that the forest can absorb. This cycle
                    makes the preservation of the rainforest a key ingredient in the fight against
                    global warming. The rainforest is also important in the health area because it
                    is the source of extracts that have beneficial effects.</p>
                <p>On one level, the rainforest was an important aspect of our negotiations in
                    preparation for the environmental conference. On another, the future of the
                    rainforest was symbolic of the economic development of Brazil. The people who
                    were trying to bring Brazil into the modern economic world saw the rainforest as
                    the key to development of the Amazon basin. If the forest were to be preserved,
                    as the strict conservationists believed, no economic development could be
                    generated in the area. Schemes such as the preservation plans in Costa Rica and
                    other places were seen as unviable in Brazil. The states in the Amazon basin
                    were facing almost the same dilemma that an American county like Loudon in
                    Virginia is facing today. Developers want to fill the empty spaces with housing
                    and malls; that may not sound environmentally nor acceptable to people already
                    living there. In Brazil, the issue in large measure came down to the political
                    question of what jurisdiction controlled the rainforest. The Amazon states are
                    currently led by people who are pushing development; they view a protected
                    rainforest as an impediment to their goals and believe the “do gooders” who live
                    far away are depriving them of the opportunity to raise their standard of
                    living. The leading Amazonian governor ran on a platform that featured
                    chainsaws—that was his symbol for his successful campaign. It attracted much
                    support in his state—and comparable outrage in many parts of the world. He keeps
                    being re-elected and I think is still the governor today. So the goal is to find
                    an accommodation which would allow legitimate economic development while
                    protecting the environment. In the short term, it is essentially an economic
                    issue because it is very expensive to develop without damaging the
                    environment.</p>
                <p>The Brazilians were very conscious of the picture that some environmentalists
                    were painting of their country—scoffers and destroyers of the environment. They
                    made efforts in the pre-conference days, to improve their image. They created
                    the position of the Secretary for the Environment—a Cabinet level position. A
                    well known environmentalist was appointed to the job; he had been a scientist
                    who had made his reputation by finding ways to produce chemicals in an
                    environmentally acceptable way. Everything that he did was carefully calculated
                    to protect the environment. So he was highly respected by the global
                    environmental community. His appointment was certainly an image plus for Brazil,
                    but in the final analysis he didn't have as much an impact on policy development
                    as he, and his supporters, might have hoped. He was another person with whom we
                    had close relationships, particularly in the period leading up to the
                    conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The proliferation issue, which encompasses the potential both for the development
                    of nuclear weapons and for their delivery systems, was of great concern to the
                    US. Brazil had the technical know-how and resources to develop both. As is often
                    the case, there were two sides to this discussion. Nuclear energy has peaceful
                    applications as everyone knows; the Brazilians staunchly maintained that their
                    nuclear programs were directed entirely to peaceful purposes—they had no intent
                    to produce nuclear weapons. They made the same case for delivery systems because
                    that technology can be used for space exploration as well. The Brazilians had
                    aspirations to participate in the commercial development of launch vehicles for
                    such things as communication satellites, which they were also trying to produce.
                    It must be remembered that, even though there is a wide gap between the “haves”
                    and the “haves not” in Brazil, it has the human and other resources to compete
                    in almost every area of science and technology.</p>
                <p>What I found when I arrived was that Brazil was embarked on certain nuclear
                    programs. It was also actively engaged in the development of launch vehicles.
                    Our efforts in both areas were intended to get Brazil into the international
                    regimes governing these activities so that some discipline could be imposed in
                    both areas. In the nuclear area, that meant signing the nuclear
                    non-proliferation treaty or an equivalent international understanding. That
                    treaty and associated agreements allow for peaceful uses of nuclear energy; they
                    prohibit any work on weapons or associated military inquiries. The Brazilians
                    took the position then, which they still maintain, that the nuclear
                    non-proliferation treaty was a one-sided arrangement which allowed the members
                    of the “nuclear” club—i.e. those countries which already possessed nuclear
                    weapons—to block any other country from developing its own capacity, not only
                    for weapons, but in the nuclear field generally. In this, they were joined by
                    other potential nuclear weapons states, such as India and Pakistan. The
                    Brazilians reserved the right to test nuclear devices because they maintained
                    that this was necessary for them to develop a peaceful nuclear capacity—which
                    was allowed by the NPT. Even though as a matter of principle Brazil would not
                    sign the NPT, it claimed it was already abiding by its provisions.</p>
                <p>The U.S. position initially was to say that countries that did not sign the NPT
                    could not expect any cooperation in the nuclear field. Over time, we moderated
                    our view and decided that there were other ways to prevent proliferation beyond
                    the confrontational stance that we had taken. Diplomacy is the art of finding
                    satisfactory bridges between seemingly unreconcilable positions. The Treaty of
                    Tlatelolco, named for the Mexican Foreign Ministry building in which it was
                    signed, is a hemispheric nuclear non-proliferation agreement. The tenets of that
                    treaty are compatible with the NPT. It became increasingly clear that, if Brazil
                    would ratify the Treaty of Tlatelolco, then our objectives would be largely met.
                    So we shifted to pressing the Brazilians to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty.
                    Eventually, the Brazilians did ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty, whose terms they
                    continue to abide by.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>My role in this area was first of all to convince Washington of the realities on
                    the ground, including urgings to expand our perspective to include regimes other
                    than the NPT to accomplish our purposes. Eventually, when the U.S. modified its
                    position, our role was to convince the Brazilians to ratify the Treaty of
                    Tlatelolco, which they had already signed. There were a lot of obstacles to this
                    strategy; the possibility of using another vehicle to achieve some kind of
                    control on Brazil's nuclear program had never been thoroughly examined. One of
                    the reasons was an unresolved question about the implications of the Tlatelolco
                    Treaty for nuclear power outside the hemisphere, but with territories within the
                    region—the United States, the UK, and France. The other question concerned Cuba
                    and what role it might take. Could you have a nuclear regime in the hemisphere
                    without Cuba's participation? These were challenges that had to be overcome, but
                    they were not insurmountable, once people accepted, in principle, that this was
                    a viable alternative which could achieve US objectives on non-proliferation.</p>
                <p>There were some in Washington, the “true believers,” who were opposed to any
                    flexibility on proliferation issues. The two aspects—weapons and delivery
                    systems—are intimately related. People involved in these two fields tend to be
                    the same people. Experts on strategic delivery systems also tend to be experts
                    on weapons. Those who had traditionally guided US policy in this area still
                    looked for certainty in this area. If they were satisfied with arrangements for
                    weapons control, then they would move quickly to delivery systems to ensure
                    complete satisfaction there. They insisted that every aspect of both complicated
                    issues be settled before they would agree to anything. It was a strategy
                    calculated to block any progress in an area where certainty is the most illusive
                    commodity.</p>
                <p>What we in the Embassy were trying to do is to take small steps, one at a time,
                    which eventually might lead to a comprehensive agreement. We had a very
                    pragmatic approach. There was no difference between the “purists” and ourselves
                    on the final goal—bringing Brazil's nuclear and space launch programs into an
                    international control regime which would have restrained the use of technologies
                    for non-peaceful uses through a system of inspections and other internationally
                    supervised control mechanisms. I don't think Brazil was ever viewed as a wanton
                    destabilizer with aggressive intentions, but it was potentially capable of
                    transferring dangerous technology to other less peaceful parties whose purposes
                    might have been inimical to the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Let me turn to other subjects. Human rights issues were always on the agenda,
                    with excesses being committed by the Brazilians—as they are still being
                    perpetrated today. Brazil is a huge country organized along a federated system.
                    Much of the law enforcement falls on the states and the municipalities. The
                    reality in Brazil is that the writ of authority does not reach down to the local
                    level in many parts of the country. The excesses almost uniformly are committed
                    by local authorities—if authorities are involved at all. We encouraged in those
                    cases an extension of federal authority in order to hold local authorities
                    accountable for any deed within its jurisdiction. We went to the Minister of
                    Justice, Jarbas Passarinho, to seek his intervention because, under some
                    circumstances, he could invoke federal authority and jurisdiction in human
                    rights cases. In other situations, we pushed the state or the municipality by
                    dealing directly with officials at those levels to try to get them to take
                    remedial actions—in addition to urging federal authorities to be more vigorous
                    in their pressure on state and local officials. Our interventions were not
                    always welcomed by the Brazilians; we were after all interfering in domestic
                    affairs of a democratic country. But human rights are also internationally
                    recognized under the UN charter, and therefore an obligation of all states. That
                    was a constant theme during my tour. In dealing with Brazilians there are
                    certain issues in which the U.S. has to stake out its position and make that
                    position, popular or not, eminently clear to all. What I and my staff tried to
                    do is to make sure that people knew where we stood through press releases,
                    public statements, speeches, and other tools of public diplomacy. For example, I
                    would regularly write Op Ed pieces which were published in major Brazilian
                    newspapers. We tended to focus on the Rio and Sao Paulo press which were widely
                    read, and quoted in all parts of the country. I must have written dozens and
                    dozens of these articles—almost on a monthly basis. That got our message out;
                    these pieces were read by the authorities, who would frequently give me
                    feed-back, particularly if they objected to my views. I was very careful in
                    preparing these Op Ed pieces so that I could stand behind every word
                    expressed.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>In addition to public diplomacy, we worked very hard behind the scenes—in
                    private—to advance US positions. Diplomatic conversations were strictly private;
                    my interlocutors had to know what they said to me would not find its way into
                    the public domain. As they saw that their confidences were respected, their
                    trust in me increased. They may have preferred to have a less public American
                    Ambassador, but eventually they accepted that this was part of my modus
                    operandi. But having observed that their comments to me remained private, they
                    became increasingly frank; we covered all issues in the most candid and bluntest
                    fashion and no offense was taken because the officials knew that these were the
                    views the U.S. presented in an unvarnished fashion. I think that was an
                    effective way to conduct business. We obviously did not always see eye to eye.
                    For example, toward the end of my tour, there was an egregious human rights case
                    involving Indians in the northern states—apparent complicity by local
                    authorities in murder and torture. We consulted with other diplomatic missions
                    with an interest in human rights. I told the Brazilians that we would be sending
                    an Embassy officer to monitor the situation on the ground. I sent her to
                    Amazonia; she was accompanied by a representative of the British Embassy. When
                    they arrived at their first departure point near the site of the incident, the
                    local authorities blocked them from reaching their first destination; they were
                    “detained” which brought a major and instant protest from us. Initially, the
                    Foreign Ministry reacted very negatively—our action was an “infringement of
                    Brazil's sovereignty.” Eventually, the Ministry backed off; we had established
                    our principle and would not back off. So there was always some tensions in our
                    relationships with the Brazilians on such issues. The Embassy was set on
                    promoting and defending US interests; the Brazilians did not always embrace that
                    role, but I think in the end they accepted our advocacy as reasonable and
                    appropriate, even if it made them uncomfortable.</p>

                <p>Many observers, including me, view the Brazilian Foreign Service as one of the
                    world's best. It is an elitist service, recruited from a large population. It is
                    relatively small, by US standards—in the hundreds, not thousands. Traditionally,
                    the officers are selected from the upper class. The requirements in academic
                    attainment, including fluency in at least two languages, are very high. In
                    addition a Brazilian Foreign Service officer can expect to go through a rigorous
                    diplomatic training program before he or she reports to the first assignment.
                    They are tested before each promotion. Great emphasis is placed on language
                    skills, which reinforces Brazil's emphasis on multilateral diplomacy. In
                    addition to Washington and a few other major world capitals, the key assignments
                    in the Brazilian Foreign Service are Geneva and New York—centers of
                    international organization activities. The fast track for Brazilian Foreign
                    Service officers is through assignments to Brazilian missions to international
                    institutions. Brazil continues to assign its “best and brightest” to these
                    posts. As a consequence, Brazilian senior Foreign Service officers are extremely
                    knowledgeable about global issues and very much at home with multilateral
                    diplomacy. A Brazilian Foreign Service officer, after several years of service,
                    can be assigned to any of these multilateral organizations and find himself or
                    herself immediately productive because there is virtually no learning curve.
                    They are already familiar with the organization and usually know the staff well
                    from previous assignments. Those elements combine to give the Brazilian Foreign
                    Service its world class status; they are proud of that standing and work hard to
                    maintain it.</p>
                <p>While in Brazil, I was witness to some of the ramifications of the reunification
                    of Germany. The East German Ambassador was recalled and the former West German
                    Ambassador hosted the combined—East and West—German national day. The Soviet
                    Embassy was our near neighbor; it was in a state of disarray as events unfolded
                    in East Europe and the USSR. The staff was wondering what would happen next and
                    what the future would hold for them. At the time of the collapse of the Soviet
                    Union, the Soviet Embassy was staffed by old line communists—at least that is
                    what we thought. They turned out not to be so “old line” as policies changed
                    rapidly in Moscow. The broad common interest asserted itself very, very rapidly
                    between our two embassies. The Ambassador stayed on—I assume because there was
                    so much turmoil in Moscow that restaffing the Embassy in far-off Brasilia was
                    not a high priority. There was a draw-down in Russian Embassy staffing; as
                    people left, they were not replaced. They had severe budgetary problems and
                    little guidance from the Kremlin. We in fact became an element of stability, if
                    not support, for our neighbors. I became a close colleague of the Russian envoy,
                    who stayed on even after the dissolution of the USSR. All very ironic.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>The events in Eastern Europe had a definite impact on the Brazilian political
                    landscape. The Marxist parties, which had been around for a long time and tended
                    to mirror the fissures in the communist world—hard line vs soft line—became
                    rudderless as Moscow's leadership faded. An internal split took place. The
                    minority of the “old line” spouted their ideology as if nothing had happened in
                    Moscow. I refer to such people as Oscar Neimeyer, the architect of Brasilia and
                    a die-hard communist, who never changed his views of the way the world should
                    work. Then there was Ignacio Lula de Silva, the defeated Workers Party
                    presidential candidate, and some of his party cadres who were quite unsure about
                    how to react to Gorbachev and glasnost. They wanted to retain the Marxist
                    underpinning to the state; they did not change gracefully. The orthodox
                    communists were even more uncomfortable with events in Moscow and Eastern
                    Europe. Their script had relied heavily on the existence of the Soviet Union;
                    when the USSR collapsed and was not followed by another strong communist stage,
                    the Brazilian communists became disoriented; they are probably still today
                    looking for their agenda. For the Brazilian left, more generally, the demise of
                    the Soviet Union demanded a long-overdue reevaluation of some of its own
                    assumptions about the role of capitalism and its relationship to political
                    freedom. This process continues.</p>
                <p>An aspect of this process was the relationship of leftist parties to the U.S.
                    Embassy. Even before my arrival, I had been the subject of scurrilous
                    allegations by a member of the Workers Party. As was my practice, whenever I was
                    assigned, I scrupulously tried to be in touch with as many different segments of
                    the host country's society as possible. In Brazil, I wanted the Embassy to have
                    as wide contacts as possible, regardless of their points of view. The Workers
                    Party was a democratic party; we made special efforts to reach out to it. Our
                    labor attach� had very good contacts with the Workers Party; he did a good job
                    of dispelling some of their misconceptions. Party leader “Lula,” however, was
                    still reluctant to be seen in public with the American Ambassador. I tried to
                    call on him when I arrived in Brazil; he was “unavailable.” Eventually, he
                    became available—perhaps due to intense party reassessments following the
                    collapse of the USSR.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, the environmental conference was the zenith for official visits.
                    There were numerous delegations from the US: President Bush and his large
                    official party, Senator Gore and his Democratic delegation, a bipartisan Senate
                    delegation, and a similar House delegation. Everyone wanted to be involved in
                    the environmental event of the decade. But each wanted his or her own moment in
                    the sun—not to be shared with any other delegation. So we were spread rather
                    thin trying to support all these various groups. But aside from that tidal wave
                    of visitors, throughout my four years in Brazil, we did not lack for visitors.
                    President Bush came several times. The U.S. delegation to the Collor
                    inauguration was headed by Vice President Quayle—who also came several times. We
                    had a number of Senators—e.g. Bill Bradley (D-NJ), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). We had
                    Cabinet officers come—e.g. Lloyd Bentsen (Treasury). Then there were many
                    members of Congress—e.g. Dan Rostenkowski.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>The Rostenkowski visit was quite memorable. He was heading his House Ways and
                    Means Committee, which is a large group, all of whom came. The Chairman was
                    known for the discipline that he demanded of his Committee—one of the last of
                    the “old style” chairmen. If Members did not participate as he expected, he or
                    she was told that they would not be welcome for other events on the schedule.
                    There were several situations like that during the Committee's visit. In one, a
                    breakfast meeting I particularly recall, was scheduled by the Chairman, but very
                    few Members showed up after a long day previously. They were frozen out of
                    meetings for the rest of the visit. He ran his Committee with tight
                    discipline.</p>
                <p>But I must also note that there was an element of personal discomfort for me
                    associated with that visit. The U.S. Executive and Legislative Branches operate
                    by different rules—what is acceptable for a representative of one may not be
                    acceptable for a representative of the other. There is some merging of standards
                    now, but there are still differences. For example, what a Congressman may accept
                    from a supporter is different from what an Executive Branch representative may
                    accept. These differences were highlighted during the visit to Rio by the Ways
                    and Means Committee. The Chairman and Committee members accepted gratuities, in
                    the form of a golf outing arranged by US corporate sponsors, which probably
                    would have crossed the lines for an Executive Branch employee. I have a picture
                    at home with me standing with President Collor and Chairman Rostenkowski—one was
                    impeached and the other sent to prison for ethics violations.</p>
                <p>I might comment briefly on my relations with President Collor. Prior to winning
                    election Collor's public experience was limited. He served as governor of a
                    small northern state. He had gone to university in Brasilia, which broadened his
                    exposure to public life to some degree, but he had essentially lived on the
                    periphery of the Brazilian political scene. Not yet 40; he was very telegenic.
                    He entered into a close relationship with Brazil's leading communication
                    entrepreneur, who controlled the world's third largest media empire. Those
                    facilities were made available to Collor who used them to articulate a reform
                    message which was eagerly received. In the preliminary rounds leading up to the
                    elections, he swept past all of his better known competitors who, by comparison,
                    were perceived as old, traditional, tired, worn-out politicians. So Collor ran
                    and won as an outsider. He had his political debts, which were larger than
                    anyone realized at the time. But he looked like a fresh breeze which was
                    underscored by his appointment of new people to key positions. He challenged the
                    status quo; for example, he presented a fairly radical economic program to
                    Congress and asked for immediate approval. But he quickly ran into difficulty
                    because the basic political structure of the country remained unchanged; it was
                    still a federal system with the power residing in the Congress and at the state
                    level. The Brazilian President does not have any authority over Congress; he
                    cannot force measures upon it. That makes reform hostage to a bargaining process
                    with Congress, and the Congress demanded a high price.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Collor was personally stand-offish. I made great efforts to develop a
                    relationship—to open direct channels. He was reluctant to join in. The Foreign
                    Ministry supported this arms-length relationship because it wanted ambassadors
                    to work through it—not unlike foreign ministries the world over. Brazil is a
                    large country with an exceptionally strong Foreign Ministry—far more influential
                    than our own Department of State. In Brazil, it is not the norm for an
                    ambassador to have ready access to the President as might be true in smaller
                    countries. As in the US, the Brazilian President has a large staff to filter
                    information and control access and to support him. Some of my colleagues in the
                    Bureau of Inter-American Affairs could never seem to understand that norms for
                    contact in countries like El Salvador and Honduras were not also approachable in
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>Difficulties notwithstanding, I made a major effort to ensure that we had the
                    kind of direct communications with President Collor that I thought were
                    required. I did not want to see him every day; I just wanted to be able to reach
                    him on those occasions when I or Washington thought direct access was required.
                    But I must say that it took a full year to develop the kind of access that I
                    thought was desirable—the “door guards” were very active and wouldn't let anyone
                    through. It was not a situation in which others were allowed access which was
                    denied to me. Far from it, diplomats were seldom received. I probably had the
                    best access in the corps. In retrospect, that Presidential closed circle may
                    have been connected to processes that were not evident at the time; the palace
                    “guards” may have been trying to shield some unsavory aspects of the Collor
                    administration, which eventually did become public.</p>
                <p>Collor was young and impressionable, particularly by riches and imperial
                    grandeur. He allowed the unchecked flow of funds during the campaign to continue
                    on after his victory. The unsavory campaign fund-raising methods were continued
                    after Collor took power; they then became graft and corruption. The campaign
                    agents continued to take their cuts. Eventually, the Collor fund-raising system
                    collapsed and he left the Presidency in disgrace.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The Brazilian media is evolving. Traditionally, the media has been very
                    influential. With some exceptions, it has been a strong supporter of democratic
                    practices. The largest papers were family owned and generally regionally
                    focused. There are large papers, based in Rio or Sao Paulo, which are becoming
                    national journals. Like most things in Brazil, the media “heavy hitters” are now
                    located in Sao Paulo—and increasingly are finance and culture. The political
                    power is still dispersed within the federal system, which gives rural areas and
                    less populous states disproportionate leverage. In other fields, the power is
                    moving south towards the industrial, business, and financial powerhouse of Sao
                    Paulo. So we had to build a relationship with the Sao Paulo power brokers. That
                    places great responsibility on our consul generals in Sao Paulo and to a
                    somewhat lesser extent, Rio. That makes it very important to have able principal
                    officers at those constituent posts; in fact, we have assigned former
                    ambassadors or ambassadors-to-be to Sao Paulo, which makes it unique. I like to
                    describe Sao Paulo as a combination of New York and Chicago in their
                    relationship to Washington. We have been fortunate in that our recent CGs in Sao
                    Paulo have been officers of stature and competence. As it should be, the
                    Consulate General in Sao Paulo is now the largest and most important constituent
                    post in Brazil.</p>
                <p>Rio had become less significant and that is reflected in the recently reduced
                    staffing of the post. I think there was and may still be more support staff in
                    Rio than actually required, but that is the lag effect—even after 30 years—of
                    moving a capital from one city to another; the post which used to be the embassy
                    tends to remain over-staffed.</p>
                <p>It is of course frustrating for an ambassador to be residing in the capital when
                    the vast majority of the country's economic, political, social and cultural
                    fabric is being woven outside of it. Even frequent travel does not compensate
                    for the isolation of Brasilia; you just cannot stay in sufficient touch with all
                    parts of the country. So you have to adopt a strategy which in the first place
                    clearly spells out your objectives—what is your agenda?; then you focus on those
                    goals using public diplomacy as an indispensable tool. Secondly, you have to
                    effectively use the constituent posts; they have to be part of the U.S.
                    diplomatic program and must act in full coordination with other US
                    establishments in the country. No constituent post can act on its own agenda.
                    That may lead to communication problems; there has to be clarity as to who is
                    doing what and how the work of each fits into the overall U.S. effort. The key
                    to coordination is an effective communication system between the ambassador and
                    the principal officers in the constituent posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Communications were increasingly easier from Brasilia, but the distances between
                    the capital and the major centers in Brazil are still great and flights take
                    several hours. We had a small Defense Attach� aircraft—a C-12—which was
                    sometimes available, but was never intended to be a substitute for commercial
                    transportation. It was there primarily to permit Defense Attach�s to travel to
                    remote areas—which was useful on such a vast country. But a chief of mission
                    just can't be everywhere; it is a mistake to think that his or her role is to
                    see and be seen in all of the 26 states of Brazil. To do so would be to abdicate
                    other more important responsibilities. What I tried to do was to limit my travel
                    to those cities and areas which were most relevant to our policy agenda. That
                    took me most frequently first to Sao Paulo; then to Rio; and perhaps next, to
                    the Fortaleza, the capital of Ceara in northeast Brazil. Ceara had a progressive
                    government, and was the center of innovative activities in the economic and
                    human rights area with which we wanted to be associated. By our presence, we
                    wanted to indicate support for the ongoing initiatives. We hoped that in this
                    way we would convey a message; in the Brazilian context, that was another
                    effective way to let people know where we stood.</p>
                <p>The sheer size of Brazil makes it a world power—at least in Brazilian eyes.
                    Brazilian foreign policy focuses on global issues. Brazilian diplomats viewed
                    Latin America as a potential restraint on the country's aspirations to play a
                    global role. At the same time, Brazil wanted to be seen as the leader of South
                    America. Its main rival was Argentina, but increasingly, Brazil's sheer size has
                    made it the 800 pound gorilla in the region. It will almost inevitably be the
                    dominant voice in South America. That fact translates into US concerns; for
                    example, in the trade area, we had competing views on how the trade system in
                    the region should be organized. Building on the North America Free Trade Area
                    (NAFTA), we planned for an eventual hemisphere-wide free trade area. The
                    Brazilians believed that these free trade plans were moving far too rapidly and
                    that they would inevitably lead to the destruction of Brazil's protected
                    industries, leaving the U.S. as the dominant economic engine in the region.
                    Brazil preferred to start with a southern common market—Brazil, Argentina,
                    Uruguay and Paraguay—led by Brazil. That common market, once consolidated, would
                    be expanded to cover the rest of South America. Only then would negotiations be
                    initiated with NAFTA—bloc to bloc, with Brazil facing the United States as an
                    equal across the table.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>The establishment of NAFTA opened a breach between Mexico and Brazil, which has
                    not yet fully healed. Brazil had a rude awakening when Mexico joined NAFTA,
                    because the foreign offices of both countries had previously collaborated on so
                    many world and regional issues. Both had viewed management of the relationships
                    with the U.S. as one of their primary foreign policy goals. The increasingly
                    friendly relations between Argentina and the US, the Chilean economic
                    renaissance, and the new Mexican economic relationship with the U.S. and Canada
                    forced Brazil to rethink its approach to the region. But still for the
                    Brazilians the focus remained largely a global one. They were particularly
                    interested in the new WTO (World Trade Organization). They believed that a
                    strengthened multilateral trade organization would provide Brazil a stronger
                    voice, particularly in the settlement of trade disputes. Brazil's objective here
                    was to put an end to unilateral actions by the United States, such as the
                    anti-dumping sanctions.</p>
                <p>The Brazilians viewed the OAS in much the same light; the Latins must form a bloc
                    and deal with the U.S. from strength. In general, the Brazilian diplomats
                    believe that only a united Latin America—led by Brazil—can successfully counter
                    the U.S. will to dominate. Only if there is solidarity among the Latin American
                    countries can they get a fair shake from the US.</p>
                <p>Before we leave this discussion of Brazil, I might briefly comment on “Operation
                    Topsy.” This was an initiative that was begun in the 1960s by Ambassador John
                    Tuthill and his Executive assistant, Frank Carlucci. The name came from Uncle
                    Tom's Cabin, it was intended to characterize a process in which the U.S. mission
                    just “growed like Topsy” with no central purpose in mind. It was an accretion of
                    agencies and personnel with a minimum of planning relating resources to policy
                    objectives. So Tuthill identified this as a problem; it was a waste of
                    resources, and it was an impediment to the achievement of US objectives. The
                    Embassy was just too large. The Ambassador undertook to analyze the staffing
                    against US objectives in Brazil. Carlucci was the action officer on this
                    project. Tuthill made significant progress while he was Ambassador which
                    coincided with my initial arrival in Brazil. Eventually, this effort ran out of
                    gas as it ran up against bureaucratic imperatives; e.g. the era of large AID
                    missions (Brazil at one time was the largest recipient of US assistance and the
                    center-piece of the “Alliance for Progress”). This effort brought a large
                    increase in US personnel and gave significant autonomy to the AID mission
                    director. When I was in Recife, there were some 200 Americans in the AID mission
                    in northeast Brazil—as compared to the 3 Foreign Service officers. By the time I
                    became Ambassador, more than 25 years later, the AID mission had been cut down
                    to a small office in Brasilia to monitor the final phases of the assistance
                    program—less than 6 people to manage a program of between $10-$20 million, with
                    most of the accounting done in Washington. The aid program had been all but
                    terminated following the US/Brazil disputes of the 1970s; military assistance
                    was eliminated entirely and other assistance began a phase out process.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>Brazil was never a center for assistance to other countries in the region because
                    it was so different from its Latin American neighbors—language being the most
                    prominent, but by no means the sole difference. Brazil does not see itself as
                    strictly a Latin American country, as many countries in the region do. Despite
                    its leadership aspirations, it has never been a regional center, unlike Uruguay
                    and others that aspire to that role. Brazil did effectively project its
                    interests in the region, but its focus was always beyond Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished your tour in 1993. What happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MELTON: I was assigned to the Office of Inspector General and for two years led
                    an inspection team. Then I became Assistant Inspector General in charge of all
                    inspections. I subsequently was named Deputy Inspector General, the senior
                    Foreign Service position in the Office of Inspector General. The office has four
                    divisions: inspections, audits, investigations, and security and intelligence
                    oversight.</p>
                <p>The Inspector General has a broad mandate which, in practice, is only limited by
                    his or her self imposed limitations and the Congressional oversight process.
                    Inspections are policy based; they also look at waste, fraud, and mismanagement,
                    but the principal focus is policy and resource management. In an overseas
                    inspection, the first item for discussion is what the U.S. is trying to
                    accomplish in a particular country. Then the team looks at what tools are
                    available to reach these ends—and the resources reasonably allocated to advance
                    US goals and objectives. Are the chiefs of mission and his or her country team
                    adequately managing the resources available to them in a coordinated way, across
                    agency lines?</p>
                <p>There is a significant element of the Office of Inspector General devoted to
                    security issues, including intelligence oversight. This unit conducts separate
                    inspections of the security readiness of our overseas establishments as well as
                    of Washington entities. They use very precise guidelines to determine whether
                    posts are taking all necessary and prudent steps to resist security
                    threats—including possible terrorist attacks.</p>
                <p>Inspections of the domestic and overseas activities of the Department is the
                    oldest function of the OIG. Within the Department and the Foreign Service, it is
                    certainly the one that is best known and probably best regarded. The other
                    functions of the Office contain more seeds of conflict—e.g. the Office of
                    Investigations which has law enforcement responsibilities and can make arrests
                    and referrals for prosecution. The Office of Audits, which is the largest
                    division of the Office of Inspector General, has a longer term perspective and
                    focuses on systemic issues. Of all the OIG activities, those carried out by the
                    Office of Inspection are viewed most favorably by the Foreign Service if my own
                    experience is any guide. The Office of Inspection has also been mentioned
                    favorably by the American Foreign Service Association, which has criticized
                    other OIG functions, such as investigations, on due process grounds.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Because I had served as head of a Class 1 mission—the largest—I was initially
                    given the job of leading inspections of large missions. One of the precepts of
                    inspections is that they are carried out by those with at least 2 comparable
                    level of experience of those being inspected. So recruiting team leaders is not
                    easy if you want quality officers. It has not traditionally been a stepping
                    stone for onward senior assignments; that is not all bad because you need people
                    with independent judgment which often comes when an officer is not concerned
                    with his or her next assignment or promotion. As soon as I reported for duty, I
                    prepared myself for a series of inspections. The first one was Egypt, which is
                    our largest mission—primarily because of the size of our assistance program
                    which is a byproduct of the Middle East peace process. It is not quite as large
                    as Israel's program, but at $1.2 billion per year is quite large. That amount is
                    divided into security assistance and development assistance. The program has
                    specific requirements, but in the final analysis, since the total is mandated by
                    Congress, the funds are eventually transferred to the Egyptians. The Israeli
                    program, by contrast, is basically a cash transfer program, but the totals in
                    both are established by legislation.</p>
                <p>The main issue in our inspection centered on assistance. How can an assistance
                    program be managed effectively when the program managers cannot, in practice,
                    hold the aid recipients to real performance standards. We found that it was very
                    difficult to build a program from the bottom up when Congressional “earmarking”
                    determined both the size and in many instances the content of the program. (An
                    “earmark” is a program level specified in a Congressional act for a specific
                    purpose or country.) The Egyptians knew full well that they would receive the
                    full amount appropriated; so that meaningful conditions for the assistance were
                    difficult to establish. The Israeli program which is also “earmarked,” is more
                    straightforward in this regard. Once a year a check is written out to the
                    Israelis for the amount Congress appropriated. The Israelis decide how the money
                    will be spent without USAID intermediators. The Egyptian program is far more
                    difficult to manage since the bulk of the funds are program and project related.
                    So there has to be bilateral agreement on each program and project. This gives
                    US managers a degree of leverage, in that they can steer funds to those Egyptian
                    entities most likely to comply with program requirements. But the leverage is
                    diminished—and in some cases eliminated—by the knowledge that the amount
                    appropriated will be obligated by the end of the fiscal year, under any
                    circumstances—if necessary by transfers for balance of payments support with
                    minimal conditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>It is a frustrating situation. Political imperatives drive the program almost
                    regardless of the impact on economic development in Egypt. This is not a sound
                    approach; it tends to demoralize those responsible for program management.
                    Knowing that all of the funds will eventually be provided, there is a tendency
                    to soften the conditions for the transfer of resources for programs which, under
                    normal circumstances, might not be funded. The U.S. bureaucracy has not
                    performed very admirably; it is true that Egypt's pivotal role in the Middle
                    East peace process was the principal justification for the large assistance
                    program. But program standards should be maintained as well. Rather than
                    pressure program managers in the field to arbitrarily relax or ignore conditions
                    previously established, the funds either should be withheld or reprogrammed, one
                    or the other. Congress carries a major share of the responsibility for this
                    situation for the manner in which the legislation is written. In our report, we
                    discussed these issues and posed the dilemma to the Secretary of State, and the
                    AID Administrator.</p>
                <p>One of the problems at the time was that the Office of the Inspector General
                    itself was undergoing changes. Sherman Funk, who had been the Inspector General
                    for a long time had retired and the new Inspector General had not yet been
                    appointed. So the Office was not in a good position to take on controversial
                    issues, even though inspection teams continued to pose difficult questions, as
                    in the case of Egypt. We presented recommendations; the first one dealt with the
                    issue I have just discussed. We did not blame the “earmarking,” but rather the
                    Executive Branch's response to that Congressional mandate. We tried to get the
                    Department and USAID to face up to this issue working with the NEA and USAID
                    leadership. But since our own Office was not as aggressive as it might have been
                    in pursuing the issue and in light of the bureaucracy's reluctance to deal with
                    such politically charged issues, the recommendations did not produce the
                    response they should have. There was some discussion and eventually there was
                    some reprogramming of a portion of the Egyptian funds to other purposes, but I
                    think that the real reason for this action—a first time for the Egypt
                    program—was general Congressional reduction in AID funds rather than an explicit
                    decision to accept our recommendations.</p>
                <p>Egypt desperately needed economic reform. It is almost axiomatic that, if a
                    country does not have a good macroeconomic regime, specific programs designed to
                    promote economic development objectives are going to be undermined at best, or
                    more likely, will be entirely ineffective because of a country's deficient macro
                    politics. The Embassy and the USAID mission quite rightly were focusing on
                    macroeconomic objectives and working with the Ministry of Finance to achieve
                    them. It was equally clear that the Egyptian government did not place
                    microeconomic policy reform very high on its agenda. It focused more on the
                    political process of satisfying constituencies and balancing various domestic
                    pressures. The government was facing the beginnings of domestic opposition; it
                    had a fierce program of repression, particularly against those elements
                    perceived as domestic terrorists. Human rights was a real issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>An example of the problems created by this assistance process would arise when
                    the Embassy engaged the Ministry of Finance to discuss the conditions that had
                    to be met before funds would be transferred. Close to the end of the fiscal
                    year, it was clear to the USAID administrators that the conditions were not
                    going to be met. Since the money would have to be provided at some time in
                    accordance to Congressional mandates, the administrators were faced with the
                    question of whether they should continue to deal with the Ministry of Finance in
                    the hopes that a few more targets might be met or whether to insist on a
                    renegotiation of the agreement which would include only conditions that the
                    administrators knew could be met—a face saving device. What evolved over time
                    was a preemptive strategy; the USAID administrators would increasingly negotiate
                    with Egyptian officials outside Finance in whom they had confidence and who they
                    thought would meet the conditions to be included in the agreement. This strategy
                    almost ensured that our aid had less and less relevance to the macroeconomic
                    issues with which the Ministry of Finance wrestled. The issues that the
                    administrators would focus on, while important, were not central to the
                    management and reform of the total Egyptian economy. On the other hand, that
                    strategy ensured that targets in specific agreements would be met. But as noted,
                    those targets became less meaningful as the macroeconomic issues were not dealt
                    with.</p>
                <p>That then is the problem which we highlighted in our report, but as I said, we
                    were only modestly successful in having the Executive and Legislative Branches
                    deal with it. We were not encouraged to talk to the Congressional staffers, in
                    part because the Office of Inspector General was in a state of transition,
                    although we were more aggressive in circulating and defending our findings than
                    perhaps the Office may have desired. But in the final analysis, the decision was
                    made not to follow up on our recommendations. In the normal inspection
                    procedure, the teams are quickly reassigned to another set of inspections after
                    they have completed their reports on their previous inspections. The team
                    therefore did not have the time to follow up on its recommendations. Follow-up
                    is left to the Office, which tends to be less engaged.</p>
                <p>Meaningful assistance to Egypt is difficult enough. It is a country which had
                    limited arable land—essentially along the banks of the Nile. It has a tremendous
                    population growth which makes economic development increasingly difficult. And
                    finally, it is beset by corruption which is endemic. Without some meaningful
                    resolution of these challenges, assistance programs will only have a very
                    limited effect on Egypt's development.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>After Egypt, I went with my team to the Philippines. The central issue there was
                    the ability of the staff to manage a large mission. For example, we were
                    concerned by the environment of corruption that existed in the Philippines,
                    which inevitably impinges on the operations of a US mission. Consular operations
                    especially are at great risk—the pressure to secure entry documents to the U.S.
                    through fraudulent means is very high. The Chief of Mission faces major
                    challenges in attempting to deal with an empire that includes some very esoteric
                    US agencies, many of them the relics of our historical involvement in the
                    Philippines—e.g. the Battle Monuments Commission, Veterans Administration,
                    Social Security Administration. There are annually hundreds of millions of
                    dollars of transfer payments to Philippine citizens by these agencies. Fraud
                    remains a major concern in all of these areas.</p>
                <p>We ran into serious mismanagement problems in the Consular Section which
                    subsequently led to the indictment in federal court of a senior Foreign Service
                    officer. This problem raised the question of the oversight role of the Chief of
                    Mission and the functioning of the internal process of the mission to ensure
                    that the Ambassador is fully informed and, therefore, in a position to take
                    timely action if required. In the Philippines, we found that the Ambassador was
                    not so informed and therefore could not take action. When he was advised, he
                    took action.</p>
                <p>We found that the consular problem was generated by the high value of an entry
                    visa to the US. That put a great pressure on consular officers. The high premium
                    that Filipinos put on these visas, plus widespread acceptance of bribery as a
                    normal cost of doing business, made this an obvious area of vulnerability. A
                    consular officer had to be especially alert to signs of fraud. In the case of
                    the Consular Section of our Embassy in Manila, internal controls which would
                    have assisted consular officers in detecting fraud were not in place. Operations
                    did not meet the standards of the consular handbook, which is the blueprint for
                    the operations of a consular section. Had these guidelines been followed, the
                    problems that we uncovered—and those that reappeared subsequently—would not have
                    arisen.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>That said, we found the junior officers in the Consular Section to be of high
                    quality. Not all were happy to be in Manila; the workload can be quite grinding.
                    The problem was more at the mid to senior grades, including some who had been in
                    Manila before or were drawn there for self aggrandizement. There was, for
                    example, distressing evidence that sexual favors may have at times been offered
                    to mission personnel in exchange for preferences, particularly in the consular
                    area. If employees allow themselves to become engaged in such activities, it can
                    quickly erode the fiber of a mission—across the board. We found that the usual
                    mix—gender, race, etc—one finds in a mission was absent in Manila. There were
                    relatively few female officers and staff; there was in fact a self-selection
                    process which returned people to the Philippines who had served there before;
                    there was also a high proportion of male officers and staff who had left their
                    spouses in the States. The mission therefore was almost 100% male. The
                    Department's personnel system was aware of this skewed staffing, but went along
                    with it in the interests of filling vacancies. The consequence was that a
                    manager had to be concerned with the sexual temptations that the Embassy staff
                    might encounter, particularly in a country where corruption was so rampart. We
                    were contributing to this vulnerability by our assignment process, which turned
                    the Embassy into a male bastion—unlike other missions which had more gender
                    diversity.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador had not been aware of the extent of the problem in the Consular
                    Section. He had been aware that Consular operations in Manila were different
                    from the ones that he had known before—he had just come from Mexico City which
                    had a large consular operation with its own problems. He was not familiar with
                    consular operations in the Philippines. He assumed that the Manila Consular
                    Section would be high profile and was inclined to give it the benefit of the
                    doubt. As far as he knew, the Consular Section was run efficiently by people
                    with excellent reputations. There was information available in the Security
                    Office and elsewhere that called this into question and that had not been made
                    available to the Ambassador; when that information was given to him, he moved
                    aggressively. He insisted that procedures be put in place that would minimize
                    the possibility of corruption; he made sure that deficiencies were
                    corrected.</p>
                <p>When we had completed our inspection and written our report, we had meetings with
                    the Director General and her staff. Genta Hawkins, the DG at the time, was fully
                    briefed; the issue was controversial because the focus happened to fall on a
                    senior Foreign Service officer who had had an excellent reputation in the
                    Department. I had written a corrective Inspector's evaluation report—as required
                    by our procedures which call for mandatory evaluation reports to be written by
                    inspectors on the Chief of Mission and his or her deputy and voluntary reports
                    on any Foreign Service officer that an inspector feels warranted. Usually,
                    evaluations are written when the observed performance is demonstratively
                    different from the recorded performance. That was the situation I confronted in
                    Manila which led me to write this corrective report in which I called attention
                    to serious management deficiencies in the Consular Section. It was a
                    controversial report.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>The process called for the IG to send such reports to the DG for inclusion in the
                    personnel file of the officer involved. The DG has the authority to withhold the
                    evaluation report from the file if it is deemed to be inappropriate; that is a
                    rare circumstance. Were the Director General to consistently ignore evaluations
                    prepared by inspection teams, the Inspector General could take the matter
                    directly to the Congressional Oversight Committee. So there is a check and
                    balance system. My evaluation report was thoroughly documented and I reviewed it
                    carefully with the DG.</p>
                <p>There is always an institutional reaction to a negative finding on an officer who
                    has risen to senior ranks. The people responsible for having made the assignment
                    are naturally defensive. On the other hand, the Office of Inspector General does
                    not reach its judgment lightly. It therefore has some credibility. So it is
                    important that an inspector's evaluation report be fully documented; then it is
                    accepted by the system as a valid piece of work. In the case that I have
                    mentioned, there was considerable discussion among those involved and
                    responsible. The immediate result was that the officer's tour was abbreviated,
                    which reinforced my findings. The officer concerned soon resigned from the
                    Service and faced subsequent trial.</p>
                <p>I came away from the Philippines with a feeling that our relations with that
                    country were well along in a transition period. We had given up our bases, but
                    the trauma that had initially set in after the failure of negotiations to retain
                    these facilities, was dissipating. The Filipinos were focusing on how best to
                    use those bases—i.e. free trade zones. There was a feeling that the Philippines
                    had great economic potential, but that it was lagging seriously in its
                    development behind its Southeast Asia neighbors—due importantly to corruption
                    which had to be curbed if the Philippines was ever to reach its potential
                    economically. There was also a lingering internal guerrilla war, but it was
                    beginning to peter out, although still an irritant. There were some
                    Philippine/China territorial problems, but the major issue was the question of
                    when and how fast the Philippines would be integrated into the economic
                    development schemes of the region, which depended in large part on the
                    leadership's ability to take advantage of openings that might develop. We
                    discussed this in our report as a basis for the general comment that more needed
                    to be done to realize the rich potential in US/Philippine relations.</p>
                <p>The Asia Development Bank was located in Manila. There was a question about the
                    relationship between the Chief of Mission and the U.S. executive director of the
                    Bank, who had ambassadorial rank and a separate constituency in Washington
                    outside the State Department. The executive director had his own reporting
                    channels. We noted that the relationships between these two senior US government
                    representatives needed to be sorted out. Our report resulted in a meeting of the
                    minds between the two in Manila, even though no real action was taken in
                    Washington to resolve the underlying problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Next, my team and I inspected the Bureau of International Organization Affairs
                    (IO). That was a fascinating assignment. We looked at a number of issues;
                    principal among them was the relative lack of attention that the U.S. government
                    devotes to multilateral diplomacy. That deficiency is of increasing concern as
                    more and more issues of interest to the U.S. are referred to and arbitrated in
                    international forums. Other countries place greater emphasis on multilateral
                    diplomacy. We have traditionally resisted in favor of bilateralism. That bias
                    was evident in the operations of IO—particularly in its staffing. Functional
                    bureaus in general are viewed as second tier assignments within the Department;
                    IO does not rate highly even among functional bureaus. Too many people go to IO
                    jobs for circumstantial reasons and then work to get out as quickly as they
                    can.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the premier international organization the United Nations (UN) is
                    located in New York. The U.S. mission to the UN is viewed as a “hardship” post
                    because of the high living costs. Furthermore, there has always been a degree of
                    tension between the Assistant Secretary for International Organizations and our
                    Permanent Representative to the UN. It is an unequal relationship; in theory
                    guidance to our UN mission comes from the Secretary of State through the IO
                    Assistant Secretary to the Permanent Representative. In practice, since the
                    Permanent Representative is a Cabinet level officer, he or she does not take
                    instructions from IO; that leaves the effectiveness of day-to-day operations at
                    the mercy of the personal relationships between the Assistant Secretary and the
                    Permanent Representative. If those relationships are cordial, then the results
                    of this awkward arrangement may be reasonably satisfactory. Otherwise, it is a
                    prescription for frustration and failure.</p>
                <p>When we inspected IO, the Assistant Secretary was Doug Bennet and the Permanent
                    Representative was Madeleine Albright—now the Secretary of State. During the
                    inspection, we looked at many different aspects of IO's operations. The two
                    senior officials had a cordial relationship, but it was still uneven because
                    Albright was a Cabinet level official and Bennet was not. More often than not,
                    she got her instructions from the White House; the Bureau was wise enough to
                    adjust to that fact. It was not a sound organizational set-up, but the inclusion
                    of the Permanent Representative in the Cabinet has been a tradition of long
                    standing, with certain political advantages.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>We did some traveling in connection with the IO inspection—i.e. to Geneva to look
                    at our operations there as well as NY to talk to people there. We interviewed
                    Ambassador Albright and she was very helpful to us; her comments allowed us to
                    sharpen some of the issues which ranged from the question of dues arrearages to
                    such matters as the employment of US citizens in the UN system. That last
                    problem arose because IO has a mandate to encourage the hiring of US citizens by
                    international organizations. The logic being that we, through mandatory
                    assessments, were paying 25% of the budgets, but the employment levels of US
                    citizens were far below that in virtually every international organization. Some
                    entities thumb their noses at US citizens. One of the reasons we were not
                    getting a fair share of the jobs was because we were not identifying enough
                    suitable candidates for vacancies in these organizations. We were making it very
                    easy for them to fill their vacancies with non-US nationals because either US
                    candidates were not available or those put forward were not suitable.</p>
                <p>Another issue dealt with the inordinate size of US delegations to international
                    meetings. IO has an Office of International Conferences which has explicit
                    responsibilities in this area. It has its own budget which was far too small to
                    make an impact on this issue. The theory was that this Office would have a
                    central coordinating role within the U.S. government, including oversight over
                    the size of US delegations. In fact, that was not happening. This Office was led
                    by an official far too junior to take on Cabinet level officers; bureaucratic
                    log-rolling was too often the norm. The Secretary of State's authority to
                    approve the composition of all official delegations to international conferences
                    gave the Department, and IO, in theory, at least, a powerful tool with which to
                    impose discipline. But in practice, accreditation has become largely a rubber
                    stamp operation. This authority is unevenly applied. Some agencies are unaware
                    of the Secretary's responsibility. When that authority was exercised, it was not
                    for policy reasons, but arbitrarily and for reasons which would not stand close
                    inspection. We discussed this in our report, but it is still a problem today.
                    The size of delegations is arbitrary; the presence of a US delegation to an
                    international conference is dictated more by the availability of funds to
                    various Cabinet departments than by US interests—where they are coincident, that
                    is fine, but often they are not.</p>
                <p>When it comes to inspectors' recommendations which cut across Cabinet
                    departments, implementation becomes problematic. Most inspections are carried
                    out against established standards—i.e. what is the standard and what is the
                    performance and why does a law, regulation, and norms of operation. If a
                    disparity exists between the established standard and observed practice,
                    recommendations are made to bring the two into line. In the case of
                    international delegations, there was a standard—i.e. IO's mandate to coordinate
                    participation in international conferences. But there are so many conflicting
                    interests that no one really used the authority available to the Bureau. In this
                    instance, we highlighted the problem for both the administration and the
                    Congress. But this was another instance in which the transition in the Office of
                    Inspector General worked against vigorous follow-up of the inspectors'
                    recommendations. Delegations remain too large, and coordination within the
                    Executive Branch continues to be inadequate.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>My next inspection was Canada. We have an Embassy and six consulates in Canada,
                    stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The main issue was the coordination
                    of policy because, quite understandably, what we found was that the closeness of
                    Canada was an invitation for every US government agency to conduct business
                    directly with its Canadian counterpart, either by phone or with a quick trip.
                    Often the Embassy was neither consulted nor informed, which makes the management
                    of policy quite difficult. There were some that argued that, given the nature of
                    our relationship with Canada, we should not even have an embassy in Ottawa.
                    There was a serious coordination problem. Many ideas and proposals had been
                    tabled over the years; prominent among those was the suggestion that a
                    super-coordinator for Canadian affairs be appointed who would oversee all our
                    Canadian programs and policies. Such official would be placed in the State
                    Department. Part of the argument was that Canadian matters did not get
                    sufficient attention in the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs (EUR), which
                    was probably true. A special coordinator at the assistant secretary level, or
                    even higher, would not assure necessary attention either, not to mention that a
                    similar organization might have to be created for Mexican affairs to maintain
                    some semblance of even-handedness. My inspection team found that this problem
                    should continue to be monitored, although the then chief of mission—a former
                    governor of Michigan—was doing a good coordinating job. He had direct access to
                    the White House and could call anyone in Washington he wished. That assured an
                    adequate level of coordination and an ability to get quick decisions when
                    needed. In some ways, he had found the ideal way to solve the problem, but there
                    was no assurance that an administration would always fill the Canada post with a
                    political operative who had direct access to the White House and good policy
                    sense. With some exceptions—which we noted—Embassy Ottawa was doing an effective
                    job of coordination; but its success depended heavily in the role of a single
                    individual and therefore could not be counted on in a long-term solution.</p>
                <p>While not taking on the “super coordinator” issue, we did make some suggestions
                    to the Embassy on how it might improve its internal coordination and how the
                    Ambassador might be more aggressive in his oversight of the day-to-day
                    operations of the many US agencies represented in Canada, some of which were not
                    adequately being supervised. We looked closely at the activities of the
                    non-career Ambassador, to ensure that none crossed the line into partisan
                    activities that are not appropriate for a chief of mission to be involved in.
                    There are clear limits on this subject that are spelled out in legislation and
                    regulations. Inspectors do look at this issue to make sure that the chief of
                    mission abides by those standards. We did not find any problems on this in
                    Canada, but the chief of mission found our discussions of this topic to be
                    helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>One of the big issues in Canada was the status of a number of US officials
                    assigned to Canada. The largest US official presence in Canada was from the U.S.
                    Customs and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Now that was not
                    entirely surprising. But their status was more the result of informal
                    arrangements and understandings than formal government-to-government agreements.
                    As a consequence, the terms were not consistent; for example, privilege and
                    immunity status was not clear cut. There were some official Americans who had
                    been working in Canada for 15-20 years. They were all U.S. citizens, but
                    essentially had been “Canadianized.” The Canadians found it difficult to accept
                    that these people—whom they considered to be residents—should be in a special
                    category. The rules were not clear; so there were some problems. The Customs and
                    INS people, when asked, replied that their chain of command went directly to
                    their headquarters in Washington. The Ambassador, much less the Secretary of
                    State, never was seen as part of their chain of command. Since the chief of
                    mission has a role for the direction and protection of all U.S. government
                    employees assigned to the country of accreditation, we tried to sort this out.
                    We did make some progress and I believe that, subsequently, agreements have been
                    reached settling the issue.</p>
                <p>After Canada, I inspected three African countries: Tanzania, Madagascar, and
                    Zaire (now the Congo). It was a fascinating experience. I had never really seen
                    Africa, beyond Egypt. The issues in Tanzania and Madagascar tended to be
                    primarily aid related—management issues—and in Tanzania, refugees. We thought
                    that our assistance goals were not clear enough. The authority and
                    responsibilities for coordination of all U.S. activities in a country were not
                    being adequately prosecuted. In Zaire, the primary issue was security. Members
                    of the foreign community had been threatened; there had been considerable
                    violence in the country; the government was breaking down and the transition
                    path from Mobutu to someone else was unclear. We had supported Mobutu for many
                    years, but it was increasingly clear that his days in command were coming to an
                    end and yet he was not willing to consider a transition to a democratic
                    regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>The security problem manifested itself in a decision reached sometime before we
                    got to Kinshasa which established a ceiling on the number of official Americans
                    who could be assigned to Zaire. This ceiling was 38. When we arrived, we looked
                    at the staffing pattern—as all inspectors do—and found that there were
                    considerably more Americans in country than the ceiling permitted. We found that
                    agencies were circumventing the ceiling which had been established by the Under
                    Secretary of State. The average was all “TDY” which was very expensive and
                    undermined the ability of the chief of mission to manage his operations. He
                    didn't always know who was there. The U.S. establishment in Zaire previously had
                    been a very large one; the bureaucracy in essence just refused to shrink. Our
                    judgment was that 38 was a sensible ceiling. Even without the security problem;
                    it was adequate to the requirements of our objectives in Zaire. We were
                    concerned that unless a better personnel control system were installed, the
                    mission staff would always be larger than 38. We recommended the closure of our
                    consulate in Lubumbashi, which for six years had had no Americans assigned to
                    it. It was staffed by a small number of national employees, but it retained some
                    very valuable real estate and equipment. US interests, at the time, did not
                    justify this expense. So we recommended that the post be closed, which it
                    eventually was.</p>
                <p>Underlying instability in Zaire (Congo) that occupy today's headlines could be
                    seen at the time of the inspection—the anarchy, the violence, etc. The main
                    foreign power in Zaire was Belgium, the former colonial power; the French also
                    had strong interests in the country. Unless those two countries and the U.S.
                    could agree on a common set of objectives and a policy for pursuing, it was
                    likely that they would work at cross-purposes with little progress being made.
                    For example, to encourage a transition to democracy, we had put some sanctions
                    in place. We had decided not to give visas to certain political leaders. The
                    Zairians couldn't care less; they wanted to go to Europe not to the United
                    States. So, if the policy were to be effective, it had to be also followed by
                    the Europeans. They didn't. Mobutu traveled to France, Belgium, and Switzerland
                    on a regular basis, thumbing his nose at the US. Everyone recognized what was
                    going on but there was no will to face up to the challenges. We tried to
                    highlight these issues as well. Our report also focused on the staffing issues,
                    the adequacy of security precautions, and of the evacuation plans. We found that
                    much more needed to be done in all of these areas, as subsequent events
                    dramatically illustrated.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>An overarching issue in all three countries was the failure of the U.S.
                    government to get maximum return for the resources it devoted to each. The
                    principal stumbling block was the inadequate coordination among US agencies.
                    Typically, the USAID missions had the largest staff and the most
                    resources—except in Zaire, where the program had been terminated. We found
                    separate administrative operations to support separate agencies; the State
                    Department, the USAID missions, the Peace Corps and even some of the smaller
                    agencies had their own support staffs. We made some proposals to the chiefs of
                    mission for the consolidation of these support operations. We found in Tanzania
                    and Madagascar that the USAID missions were quite willing to go along with such
                    consolidation and we tried to advance the concept with the ambassadors with
                    mixed results. There was some receptivity in Washington, but our recommendations
                    in the end fell victim to the agency consolidation debate in Washington. USAID,
                    as an institution, dug in its heels against anything that approximated
                    consolidation anywhere. I think our recommendations were correct but they got
                    caught up in the politics of agency consolidation in Washington.</p>
                <p>Another issue was the refugee problem, evident in Tanzania and Zaire. The U.S.
                    devotes large amounts of resources to refugee assistance provided primarily
                    through the Bureau of Refugee, Population and Migration Affairs, through
                    multilateral organizations, and through non-governmental institutions. The
                    oversight by the embassies was not what it should have been, even though a major
                    portion of the assistance being provided to refugees in these two countries came
                    originally from the American taxpayer. Embassies did not see this to be their
                    role; typically, refugee assistance oversight was an additional duty for a
                    junior consular officer, even, as in Tanzania, when the refugee assistance
                    program was the largest consumer of Congressionally appropriated resources in
                    the country. We were not devoting adequate oversight to these programs. Our
                    Chief of Mission in Tanzania did get involved because he had some previous
                    experience in refugee work in country, but his intervention was episodic. We
                    tried to get attention to this issue through our report. I think that our
                    comments were helpful; they might have gotten even greater attention had the
                    Office of Inspector General not been in transition.</p>
                <p>To its credit, the Office of the Inspector General, under new leadership, has
                    evolved into a more effective organization, particularly in its relationship to
                    Congress—an association which is not always welcomed by the Department, but
                    which is overdue as far as I am concerned. It should be noted that the
                    Department's IG started in 1906 and is the oldest in the government. They were
                    six officials then called “Consul Generals at Large.” The Department since then
                    has gone through several manifestations of the IG concept, as have other Cabinet
                    departments and agencies. By now the IG's mandate has been broadened
                    considerably, particularly after 1987 when the current IG statute was enacted.
                    That law says that the IG will not be a Foreign Service officer to make it
                    abundantly clear that the Inspector General should not be an “in house”
                    creature—a captive of the Department's bureaucracy. The statutory and budgetary
                    independence which the legislation provides is essential if the IG is to have
                    any impact.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>After Africa, I was asked to head a team to inspect the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency (ACDA). The State Department's IG is also ACDA's IG, more
                    recently, also covers USIA and its associated broadcasting entities. The main
                    issue we confronted was the question of consolidation—the proposed ACDA into the
                    Department. This proposal had been made shortly before the inspection by Senator
                    Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It was not the
                    first time that such an idea had been advanced, but Senator Helms held a
                    powerful position and was determined to see his idea implemented. He wanted both
                    ACDA and USAID abolished and their functions, to the extent they were retrained,
                    absorbed by the Department. That was not the primary focus of our ACDA review.
                    We were conducting a policy-based examination of overall operations of the
                    agency.</p>
                <p>In the ACDA case, we had another bench mark. Several years prior, there had been
                    a special review of ACDA conducted by OIG at the request of Congress. That
                    review examined the question of whether the Agency should continue to exist. A
                    blue ribbon panel, representing various agencies, was put together under the
                    IG's leadership. That panel concluded that the agency should continue, but
                    needed to be revitalized. It listed a number of actions that the panel thought
                    were necessary. Their findings became one of our standards; i.e. what had ACDA
                    done to implement the blue ribbon panel's conclusions? More generally, we looked
                    at ACDA's mandate and how efficiently was it carrying it out. The issue of
                    agency consolidation was addressed through our review of the arms control and
                    disarmament functions in the U.S. government. We looked at the question whether
                    there was a legitimate need for an independent voice in this area—quite aside
                    from the question of how that voice was to be provided. We concluded that there
                    were still enough unresolved issues that an independent voice continued to be
                    justified. We were concerned that there was still a major tendency in the
                    bureaucracy to subordinate arms control and non-proliferation objectives to
                    other concerns. One way to make sure that the proponents of the arms control and
                    non-proliferation perspective had their “day in court” was to give them a degree
                    of independence. That did not say that the continued existence of ACDA was the
                    only way to ensure this independence. So we were not as supportive of the
                    Agency's continued existence as the ACDA Director would have liked nor did we
                    explicitly endorse the consolidation proposal.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>We looked at other issues as well. We reviewed whether there was overlap between
                    ACDA and the Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. The NSC staff
                    had looked at that issue and concluded that 13 positions in each organization
                    should be abolished. It was clear to us that the NSC examination had not gone
                    far enough; the right questions had been asked, but the results were Salomonic,
                    simply splitting the difference between the two bureaucracies. It had not been
                    comprehensive enough. So we recommended that a more thorough review be
                    undertaken of this question. We recognized that unless ACDA were abolished
                    entirely, some duplication between ACDA and the Department was inevitable. But
                    that was not necessarily a problem because the issues were being viewed from
                    differing perspectives—one foreign policy oriented, the other an arms control
                    viewpoint. We emphasized the need to resolve the question of lead,
                    responsibility within the U.S. government on specific arms control and
                    proliferation issues, thereby avoiding duplication where it served no purpose.
                    The lead agency might inherit some resources from other organizations—staff
                    moving between ACDA and P/M—but we did not want to see the establishment of a
                    monopoly in one agency or another on arms control and proliferation issues.</p>
                <p>Another question that we addressed concerned technology research. ACDA had a
                    responsibility under law for coordination of governmentwide research in the area
                    of arms control and non-proliferation. That authority was granted in legislation
                    following the previous OIG review of ACDA activities. In examining this
                    question, it was obvious that ACDA, with a minute research budget, is swamped by
                    the large research budgets in DoD and DOE. The rule of bureaucracy is that those
                    who have the money call the tune. We found that ACDA was not adequately
                    structured to provide oversight over governmentwide research and did not have
                    the bureaucratic clout necessary to override the power of the purse. We were
                    leaning toward recommending that ACDA's mandate be explicitly expanded by the
                    President to ensure that it was taken seriously in its coordinating role. While
                    we were conducting our inspection the ACDA Director was indeed given additional
                    authority; that gave us some pause and we decided that some time should elapse
                    to see how this new authority would be used before considering further steps.
                    The ACDA Director argued for this approach; we were skeptical but thought that
                    under the circumstances, a grace period was justifiable.</p>
                <p>We found a problem in the administrative area of ACDA; there seemed to be some
                    confusion about responsibilities in this area, although legislation clearly
                    establishes the Deputy Director as the official responsible for the Agency's
                    administrative management. In practice, that was not taking place. In our
                    discussions with the Director and the Deputy Director, the latter committed
                    himself to be more diligent in this area and action was subsequently taken to
                    implement this pledge. The Deputy was Ralph Earl, one of the best known experts
                    on arms control and non-proliferation.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>After ACDA, I was contemplating retirement. I was asked by the new Inspector
                    General to stay on to head up the Office of Inspections and later to be her
                    deputy. The new Inspector General was Jacqueline Williams-Bridges who came to
                    the job following 17 years of service with the GAO. She had a strong background
                    in management and policy analysis. I was very impressed with her. I had been
                    involved in inspections for several years by this time. I had seen a number of
                    areas where significant improvements could be made in the work of the Office of
                    Inspector General. I thought the new IG would take some strong actions to
                    realize the full potential of the Office. So I agreed to stay on.</p>
                <p>For the next year, I coordinated the activities of the inspection teams. In a
                    given year, the IG undertakes some 40-45 inspections, mostly overseas, but also
                    including domestic bureaus, and ACDA, now USIA. Soon after I took the job,
                    legislation was passed that established a single IG to oversee the activities of
                    State, ACDA, and USIA. This could be viewed as one of the first steps toward
                    consolidation of these agencies. The USIA IG was terminated and the staff was
                    transferred to our office. That was a significant step, the expanded OIG assumed
                    additional responsibilities and opportunities as well. For the first time, an
                    inspection team was authorized to review the programmatic aspects of USIA
                    programs overseas. That opened up opportunities for more comprehensive reviews
                    of our operations overseas. Initially, we faced the issue of independence. In
                    State, the Office of Inspector General is staffed primarily by Civil Service
                    employees going back to the 1987 legislation. The far fewer Foreign Service
                    people are essentially recruited by the OIG; they are not simply assigned to OIG
                    by the Department. We found that this was not the situation in USIA where its
                    Office of Personnel routinely assigned Foreign Service personnel to the USIA
                    OIG, which had very little control over the process. We first asked the USIA
                    Office of Personnel to announce that there would be vacancies in the single
                    State/ACDA/USIA OIG and that Foreign Service officers should put in their bids
                    if they were interested. Eventually, we got a list and noticed that some of the
                    officers on it had already been assigned to us. We quickly set this straight; we
                    would not take personnel assigned without our approval. So USIA had to change
                    several of the assignments. We took some people off the list given to us by USIA
                    but went out and recruited other officers as well. We had to change the image of
                    the OIG within USIA so that we could attract the kind of officer most useful to
                    us.</p>
                <p>With the arrival of the new Inspector General, more effective communication
                    channels with the Congress were established. Almost immediately after her
                    appointment, the Inspector General invited key staffers of the relevant
                    oversight committees to a day long conference at a site between State and the
                    Hill. We took the opportunity to introduce ourselves, spell out our
                    responsibilities, and gave the staffers a preview of our work program for the
                    following year. So the OIG's relationship with the Congress is more open; that
                    places a new burden on the office because communications flow both ways, which
                    means more requests from the Congress—including special inquiries. In dealing
                    with Congress, one has to be very careful; both sides of the political aisle
                    must be treated exactly the same. Consultations must include representatives of
                    the minority as well as the majority. Investigations have to be conducted
                    scrupulously, particularly those which might have political visibility and
                    content.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The alleged Congressional micromanagement of foreign affairs has always been a
                    subject for debate. For example, many have criticized Congress for its
                    “earmarking.” The subject is not as clear cut as it has been portrayed. In my
                    view, a significant reason for “earmarking” is the Congressional response to the
                    perceived lack of action on the part of the Executive Branch. At times, for
                    example, Congress has believed that US foreign policy should give greater
                    emphasis to human rights, women's rights, drug enforcement, and environment. It
                    may well be that there are not enough resources to pursue all of these worthy
                    goals, but nevertheless Congress expects its policy guidance to be respected.
                    When it believes that it has not been, then it “earmarks” resources to ensure
                    that its priorities are reflected in policy; it is a mark of dissatisfaction
                    with administration policies and programs. So “earmarking” is not mindless; it
                    has a purpose. Often during inspections, we found the effect of the “earmark”
                    was not at all what Congress had intended; when that is the situation, as it was
                    on Egypt and some of the African regional programs, then it is perfectly
                    legitimate to raise questions about the “earmark.” When an inspection report
                    does that, it suggests to Congress that it take another look at the actual
                    reason than just the intended impact of the “earmark.” The results of “earmarks”
                    are frequently a distortion of policy, rather than promoting the desired effect.
                    This conclusion, however, does not dispute the legitimacy of the earmarking
                    process.</p>
                <p>I would make another point on the work of the OIG. The office provides a valuable
                    perspective to the age long dichotomy between Civil and Foreign Service
                    personnel. As I mentioned earlier, the staff of the OIG is predominantly Civil
                    Service. This includes most of the senior staff. In contrast, most of the senior
                    policy positions in the Department are staffed with Foreign Service officers or
                    political appointees. In the Department, the Director General has traditionally
                    had responsibility for both Civil Service and Foreign Service personnel, but in
                    actual practice, it is the Foreign Service that has received the lion's share of
                    attention. Increasingly, that is not an acceptable situation. The Department is
                    having great difficulty adjusting to this new environment. At issue, are such
                    challenges as the development of career service with special responsibilities
                    and requirements overseas and the question of equity and fairness, particularly
                    relating to Civil Service employees. The Department has not really come to terms
                    with those issues.</p>
                <p>In the inspection function, we would normally use a former chief of mission to
                    head each inspection team, which consisted of perhaps one or two other Foreign
                    Service officers and six to eight Civil Service employees. With such a mix, the
                    Office of Inspector General is at the cutting edge of some of these
                    Foreign/Civil Service adjustment problems. Service in the OIG points up some of
                    the larger problems that the Department and some other foreign affairs agencies
                    face in this area.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I would make one final point, which is relatively obvious. It is important that
                    an Inspector General maintain independence despite the natural tension this at
                    times leads to in relations with the Department, USIA, and ACDA. At the same
                    time, there must be a high degree of cooperation because the effectiveness of
                    the OIG depends in great part on the degree to which the OIG focuses on issues
                    which are relevant and important to the managers of the agencies for which OIG
                    has oversight responsibilities. In the inspection function, that will only
                    happen if the inspectors are cognizant and current on the major issues facing
                    the entity to be inspected. In the Department, it has become routine for the
                    Inspector General or one of the senior staff to attend the weekly staff meetings
                    chaired by the head of the agency—Secretary of State or ACDA or USIA Director.
                    They may also be invited to other staff meetings as appropriate and relevant.
                    Although the OIG mandate is very broad, that can not mean that the OIG staff has
                    the time to cover all issues. But the broad mandate is essential to ensure that
                    OIG personnel have access to all documents and records.</p>
                <p>I never encountered any real resistance to inspections from my Foreign Service
                    colleagues. I suspect that the consular officer in the Philippines did not think
                    very highly of me or the system, but that was an exception. There may be a level
                    of discomfort with the job, but that is inevitable whenever you have tension and
                    potential or actual conflict. The Office of Inspector General conducts special
                    inquiries; those tend to be more controversial than regularly scheduled
                    inspections. In the recent past, many of these inquiries seem to have involved
                    Latin America—e.g. the murder of the spouse of an American citizen in Guatemala
                    or the alleged leniency accorded a planner of the murder of Marine Guards in El
                    Salvador. Because of my previous assignments in the region and association
                    within the bureau, I recused myself from Latin American special inquiries—that
                    is standard practice in OIG; staff members must not involve themselves in
                    matters where there might be an actual or perceived conflict of interest. I did
                    not inspect any Latin American posts for this reason.</p>
                <p>But, inevitably, one runs into controversy. The OIG is the “preserver of the
                    rules and regulations” and in that sense is a friend of the system. But
                    transgressors do not always view in that way. One of the special inquiries in
                    which I was involved took me to the Vatican to investigate allegations made by
                    Senator Helms about the chief of mission—a former Mayor of Boston—who was said
                    to have misused his authority in communicating with audiences in the US—for
                    political purposes. That was a fairly controversial issue. We wrote a report to
                    the Secretary who accepted our recommendations and subsequently issued a letter
                    of reprimand to the Ambassador and tightened the procedures within the
                    Department dealing with such matters. That was unprecedented.</p>
                <p>EDITOR'S NOTE: Mr. Ambassador, I suggest that a concluding paragraph summarizing
                    your Foreign Service experience would be most helpful at this point.* * *</p>
                <p>How does one sum up a career spanning more than 35 years?</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Perhaps the most useful thing I can do is make some summary observations and
                    highlight some “lessons learned” from my time in the Foreign Service. As I look
                    back on the experience, there are certain conclusions which stand out from my
                    various assignments. Let me list some of them.</p>
                <p>— From my initial assignment in the Department's newly-established Operations
                    Center (1961-62), I belatedly draw two conclusions, both important to success in
                    the Foreign Service. The first, I attribute to my two junior officer colleagues
                    on the night watch, Herb Hoffman and Gerry Studds. Each, in his own way, was an
                    outstanding officer. Aside from their intelligence, what set them apart for me
                    was that both knew clearly what they wanted from the Service. Their standards
                    were high, and, I am sorry to say the Service failed to measure up. Unrealistic
                    expectations combined with a relative decline in opportunities for actually
                    reaching to top can be a powerful disincentive. This underscores the importance,
                    first, of having internalized standards not exclusively dependent on the
                    judgments of others, and second, of having a vision of what one expects from
                    one's career. It is not enough to aspire to an ambassadorship, although that is
                    a worthy goal. How one goes about the job day-by-day often says more about
                    character as well as expectations.</p>
                <p>— During my first overseas assignment in Nicaragua (1963-65), in addition to
                    tradecraft, I learned valuable lessons about the importance of integrity in
                    reporting and keeping focused on the U.S. longer term interests. Ted Cheney, my
                    boss in the Political Section, stood behind me in what, for a junior officer,
                    could have been a career-ending policy confrontation with hemispheric
                    representatives of the AFL-CIO. From Aaron Brown, an outstanding Ambassador, I
                    learned some of the do's and don'ts of dealing with members of the democratic
                    opposition. It is a grave disservice to those seeking the ouster of a repressive
                    regime to mislead them about political realities, building false expectations
                    about what the United States might be prepared to do. As much as we might
                    sympathize with the opposition, Ambassador Brown always stressed, it was they,
                    not the United States which have to face the consequences of failed actions to
                    end the repressive rule of the Somozas. It was a sobering, but realistic
                    message—perhaps as applicable to today's China as to the Nicaragua of the
                    1960s.</p>
                <p>— The Dominican Republic (1965-67) was a testing ground for the effectiveness of
                    multilateral diplomacy. The 1965 intervention took place under the auspices of
                    the Organization of American States. While the United States played a
                    disproportionate role in these events, a reasonably successful outcome depended
                    importantly on our ability to meld bilateral and multilateral efforts. The
                    Dominican episode was an early illustration as well of the limits of military
                    force, although the lesson was not so apparent at the time. Key to the eventual
                    outcome was the early identification of a clear objective—the holding of early
                    elections overseen by the OAS.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>— My next assignment in Recife, Brazil (1967-69), brought home to me the
                    interdependence of political and economic developments and the consequences of
                    basing policy exclusively on one or the other. U.S. policy at the time placed
                    heavy emphasis on the economy, as did Brazil's military rulers, after they had
                    subdued the opposition. Human rights advocates, on the other hand, stressed the
                    repressive nature of the regime in calling for U.S. disengagement. Neither
                    approach was wholly right. Subsequent events have demonstrated the need for a
                    more sophisticated approach which acknowledges that the vigor of the Brazilian
                    economy depends importantly on the strength of its democratic institutions.</p>
                <p>— The turbulent period at the University of Wisconsin (1970-71) probed some of
                    the basic tenets of American democracy. The go-along-to-get-along attitude of
                    too many of the university administrators and faculty members was discouraging.
                    It provided unwelcome perspective on similar behavior I had witnessed in some of
                    our unstable neighbors to the south. On a more positive note, the Wisconsin
                    experience allowed me to replenish intellectual capital—particularly in the
                    areas of political science and economics—on which I drew heavily in subsequent
                    assignments. I remain convinced that periodic long-term training, preferably in
                    American universities, is vital to maintaining a quality Foreign Service.
                    In-service training provided by the Foreign Service Institute, while important,
                    is no substitute for this academic exposure and reacquaintance with America.</p>
                <p>— A subsequent assignment in the Policy and Planning Office of the Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs (1971-74) provided my first extended exposure to policy
                    planning and resource management. The work done by this office on the Country
                    Analysis and Strategy Program, a pioneering effort to develop an interagency
                    planning system linking resources to policy objectives, set a bureau-level
                    standard in this area which has yet to be equaled by the Department. The failure
                    of the Department, and the U.S. Government, to effectively address the
                    policy-resource linkage is a management vulnerability which continues to hamper
                    the achievement of foreign policy objectives. My policy planning experience also
                    pointed to another shortcoming—the difficulty of effecting change within the
                    Department. The traditional core values of the institution, reinforced by a
                    culture which values individual virtuosity over the achievement of stated goals,
                    works against the introduction of new ways of doing business.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>— Revolutionary Portugal (1975-78) was an opportunity to apply much of the
                    experience and lessons learned during previous assignments. The near Communist
                    takeover in Portugal, and the high-level attention it received in Washington,
                    again underscored the importance of honesty in reporting. There was undeniable
                    pressure to pull punches: to cater to the biases in Washington; to give up on
                    Portugal, resigning ourselves to Marxist rule in Lisbon as a vaccination to a
                    possible Communist infection of Western Europe. There were other lessons as
                    well, such as the importance of maintaining contacts across the political and
                    social spectrum, including with those strongly opposed to our views. In the end,
                    of course, it was the Portuguese themselves who turned things around and put
                    their country squarely on the democratic path. But the Embassy played an
                    important confidence-building role through its repeated message that, given time
                    and support, democratic political forces would prevail.</p>
                <p>— The National War College (1978-79) was an opportunity to take stock and again
                    to renew intellectual capital. The curriculum, while not rigorous, was flexible
                    and therefore useful. More specialized courses at the Industrial College of the
                    Armed Forces were especially valuable. The assignment, however, carried with it
                    a negative lesson: the Department needs to devote greater attention to arranging
                    onward assignments for those selected for senior training. Failure to do so—and
                    until recently the time-in-class implications of taking an assignment with no
                    promotion potential—continues to work against getting the full potential from
                    such potentially valuable placements.</p>
                <p>— My three years in London (1979-81) exposed me to the complexities of
                    relationships with a major ally. The importance of other agencies and the
                    Congress in the making of foreign policy was every day apparent. So too was the
                    media and the myriad channels of direct communication between the two countries.
                    Embassy London was a eye-opening look—really for the first time in my career—at
                    the full range of foreign policy issues at play on the global scene,
                    particularly defense issues. At the same time, my extensive associations with
                    the British Labor Party gave me lasting friendships and a new appreciation for
                    the role of democratic opposition and the European left.</p>
                <p>— Uruguay (1982-85), where I was Deputy Chief of Mission, provided essential
                    management experience, much of it hard-won. While no training can assure success
                    in arguably the most challenging of Foreign Service positions, the Department,
                    to its credit, is making an important effort through its short course for new
                    DCMs. My Ambassador insisted that I arrive immediately, foregoing the DCM
                    course. While the exception probes the rule, prior experience as a DCM should be
                    prerequisite for those career officers considered for chief of mission
                    positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>— My three years as Director of the Office of Central American and Panamanian
                    Affairs (1985-88) placed me in the midst of a highly controversial and partisan
                    political debate in the United States. From a professional standpoint it turned
                    out to be high risk, high reward for those who survived with their careers
                    intact. Some of my colleagues took away the wrong lesson from this. Too often
                    they concluded that positions dealing with controversial policies were likely to
                    be career-ending and therefore should be avoided. Unfortunately, for some fine
                    officers I served with this turned out to be true. The growing propensity,
                    particularly within the Congress, to judge career officers associated with
                    policies with which individual members or their staffs might disagree to be
                    disqualified for positions requiring confirmation is a disturbing tendency. More
                    alarming still is the preemptive de-selection of these officers for these senior
                    positions to avoid problems on the Hill. Ironically, this trend, if unchecked,
                    is likely to lead to greater, not less, politicization of the Foreign Service,
                    as senior officers increasingly duck the really tough jobs—which are more likely
                    to be controversial—while devoting more and more attention to currying favor on
                    the Hill.</p>
                <p>— Nicaragua (1989) was dramatically different the second time around.
                    Unfortunately, the ruling Sandinistas had more than a little in common with the
                    Somozistas they replaced. Both were authoritarian; both employed repression
                    against their own people. Somoza and his supporters did it for personal
                    aggrandizement; the Sandinistas did it for the new state, controlled by a
                    vanguard party which it generously subsidized. Being Ambassador to a country
                    whose government we openly opposed was a unique experience. The Sandinista
                    leadership, while keeping me at arms length, objected to my public statements of
                    support for democracy and open contacts with members of the opposition. In
                    retrospect, the ensuing Sandinista action declaring me persona non-grata had a
                    certain inevitability about it.</p>
                <p>— My subsequent brief tenure as Deputy Assistant Secretary (1989) with
                    responsibility for relations with Mexico and the Caribbean, as well as regional
                    economic matters brought home to me the changing role of the Department in the
                    management of foreign policy. Only in those few instances in which the Secretary
                    of State took a personal and direct interest was the Department able to assert
                    its policy leadership. More often than not, foreign policy considerations were
                    decidedly secondary to domestic concerns, with de facto leadership passing to
                    another agency of government, the White House staff, the Congress, or other
                    advocacy groups.</p>
                <p>— My nomination to be Ambassador to Brazil (1989-93) was a most welcome surprise.
                    Embassy Brasilia gave me a new appreciation for the importance of administrative
                    management and quality of life issues to the successful conduct of diplomacy.
                    Chiefs of mission and senior policy managers must be personally engaged in and
                    accountable for all aspects of mission operations. From my Brazilian colleagues,
                    I developed a new appreciation for the importance of multilateral diplomacy for
                    the advancement of what increasingly for the United States is a global agenda.
                    The highly professional Brazilian Foreign Service has long made this a top
                    priority, greatly increasing Brazil's influence in international forums.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>— My final period of active service duty in the Office of Inspector General
                    (1993-97) was an opportunity to give something back to the Service, largely
                    through the leadership of teams inspecting our missions abroad. Several
                    impressions stand out from this experience. While policy management at our
                    overseas posts is generally of a high order, the same cannot be said for
                    administrative management. Failure of chiefs of mission to take this as one of
                    their major responsibilities is among the prominent causes of this serious
                    shortcoming. Another continuing deficiency both in the Department and our posts
                    abroad is inadequate coordination of programs and activities to ensure the
                    effective use of resources across agency lines to advance U.S. interests.* *
                    *</p>
                <p>Let me make some final comments about the role of the family in Foreign Service
                    life. I entered the Service in another era. It was a period with relatively few
                    women officers and certainly no tandem husband-wife teams. If a woman officer
                    married within the Service, it was assumed she would resign. Women who had
                    passed the Foreign Service examination were routinely disqualified if they
                    married serving officers. All of this is now changed. But the weight of this
                    thinking carried over during much of my career and, particularly during the
                    early years, weighed heavily on attitudes towards the role of the Foreign
                    Service spouse. Wives were expected to be supportive homemakers and hostesses
                    for representational events. Gainful employment while abroad was generally
                    discouraged.</p>
                <p>My wife graduated with me from Cornell University with a major in political
                    science, and she was every bit as qualified as I to perform professional tasks
                    abroad. She continued her education over the years, obtaining a teaching
                    certificate and becoming a licensed CPA. During our several tours in the United
                    States she taught high school and was a tax advisor and later an agent with the
                    IRS. Professional level jobs were hard to come by overseas, particularly in the
                    early years. She was a tax advisor in the IRS office in London, full-time
                    manager of a large employee association in Lisbon, and a tax advisor and
                    consultant to the employee associations in Montevideo and Brasilia. To avoid
                    even the appearance of a conflict of interest, most of her consultant's work was
                    unpaid.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>For the family there were both positive as well as negative aspects of Foreign
                    Service life. It was a continuing challenge to ensure quality education for my
                    three children. Overseas schools are a mixed bag, particularly in the developing
                    countries in which I served. I received some good advice early in my career:
                    take the hardship assignments early while your health is good and your children
                    are young; to the extent possible, plan your assignments to ensure good academic
                    facilities are available at the pivotal periods in the education of your
                    children. For the most part, I was able to do this. The most difficult period
                    was Portugal, where the quality of the American school left much to be desired.
                    We sent two of our children back to Virginia for a time to attend public school
                    in Fairfax County. All three, however, graduated from the American International
                    School in London with impressive advanced placement credits. One graduated from
                    the University of Virginia and obtained a Masters degree from The College of
                    William and Mary; another graduated from Dartmouth College and earned a medical
                    degree from Northwestern University; the third graduated from Cornell University
                    and obtained her Doctorate in clinical psychology from American University.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, one of the benefits of being overseas when my three children were
                    coming of age was the insulation it provided during a traumatic period in the
                    United States, particularly in the schools. There were the usual teenage
                    temptations available even in revolutionary Lisbon, but thankfully drugs were
                    not easily available. We were spared the horrors which flow from this source.
                    While work pressures took their toll on family responsibilities, somehow we
                    survived it all in reasonably good order. For this I give the bulk of the credit
                    to my wife. America has changed. And the Foreign Service has also changed, if
                    more grudgingly. The importance of the family for the Foreign Service, however,
                    remains no less vital today than it was throughout my career. Family members are
                    the unsung heroes of the Foreign Service.</p>
