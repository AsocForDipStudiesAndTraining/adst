                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Paul McCusker interviewing Ambassador Nicholas
                        Platt in his office at 725 Park Avenue, the headquarters of the Asia
                        Society, of which he is president. It is Monday, July 25, 1994. Mr.
                        Ambassador, would you care to identify yourself by spelling out your
                        name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: N-i-c-h-o-l-a-s P-l-a-t-t.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much. Mr. Ambassador, first of all I know
                        you were born in New York City where we are now sitting. Could you tell me
                        the date of your birth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I was born on March 10, 1936.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you came into the Foreign Service as a career back
                        in 1959. What led you to come into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, there were a number of things. One was that I was a member of an
                    organization called the Winant Volunteers back when I was in college. This was
                    one of those forerunners of the Peace Corps which sent people overseas, in this
                    particular case to London—the East End of London—to rebuild the parts of the
                    city which had been bombed out. That was the original purpose. Then, to staff
                    boys clubs and settlement houses, etc. and I found myself in one of those jobs
                    in the summer of 1955 when I was a nineteen year old between junior and
                    sophomore year at college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PLATT: I was at Harvard. I found myself representing the United States in the
                    oldest Orthodox Jewish boys club in the world, which is smack in the middle of
                    the East End of London. I was trying to justify and defend US policies before a
                    very smart group of Jewish cockney boys. I liked it, but the main thing was that
                    all of these kids I was working with made up their mind as to what they were
                    going to do long before any of us did. It was inconceivable that a nineteen year
                    old American didn't know what profession he was going into. So they asked me
                    incessantly about this and I thought about it much, much earlier than most as a
                    result. I found that I liked what I was doing, which was representing the United
                    States and its points of view in a different culture and I wondered what kind of
                    an analog there was in adult life, and the Foreign Service seemed to be the
                    closest. I started thinking hard about the Foreign Service at that point.</p>
                <p>Another influence on me was Charles Bohlen, “Chip” Bohlen, who was my father's
                    roommate at college. When I started moving in this direction I started paying
                    attention to him and his career. I met him a couple of times and we talked. And
                    that moved me in this direction. I took my first set of Foreign Service exams
                    when I was still a senior in college and failed them—not the written, but the
                    orals. I then went to Johns Hopkins under the advice of Paul Nitze who was an
                    important person in that school, and still is, and took them again. My sense
                    from the Foreign Service authorities was that their doubts about me was that I
                    was very young and they didn't really know whether I was serious about this and
                    that it was going to take two full tries before they would be convinced. So the
                    next year I tried again and made it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see you promptly got a consular job in the Windsor
                        consulate in Ontario. How did you like that as an introduction to Foreign
                        Service work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: The Windsor consulate was a place where lots of people started and ended
                    their careers. Foy Kohler started his career there. And, lots of people who were
                    not as illustrious ended their careers there. It was a very unprepossessing
                    post. Its main job was visas. I learned a lot about visas. I had taken the
                    consular course when I was at FSI, but I took the correspondence course again
                    because I found myself in effect running a busy visa section. My boss was an
                    alcoholic and a very nice man but his basic concern was that he not sign a sour
                    visa. I could do pretty much what I liked if that was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a two man post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PLATT: It was a four man post. My immediate boss was an alcoholic and my overall
                    boss was an incompetent, so I had a lot to do. I learned the visa laws cold
                    because I found myself in the position of being judge and jury to people who
                    could see the promised land over my shoulder out the windows of the consulate
                    and who were accompanied by very smart visa lawyers who came across from the
                    American side, and as a 25-26 year old I had better know what I was talking
                    about. So in the end I did. I learned a lot about how to run an office, how to
                    manage people, and how to say “no.” I learned a great deal about my own country
                    because I found myself really in the middle of the middle west and as a Yankee
                    easterner from New York, this was a foreign country to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I grew up in Niagara Falls, New York, which, of course,
                        had an American consulate on the Canadian side. The consul there, who my
                        mother knew, lived on the American side. Did you live on the American
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I lived on the Canadian side because I thought that was very important.
                    One of our people did live on the American side. But the Canadians really felt
                    strongly about it and being so close to us and so close to such a huge city and
                    economic zone, they were enormously sensitive about their sovereignty. You had
                    to convince them that you thought they were sovereign, and the first way to do
                    that was to live in Windsor, itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what got you onto the language training, were you
                        particularly interested in China at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I went into the Foreign Service as an European specialist trained in
                    German and French and well grounded in European history. I had done my thesis on
                    the passage of the Marshall Plan through Congress, so I had a smattering of
                    American government as well. As soon as I got into the Foreign Service I found
                    that Europe was full up, it was full up in a lot of ways. Everybody wanted to go
                    there. All the posts were full. You practically had to wait for someone to die
                    before you could get a job. The jobs which you could get weren't very good. The
                    policies had already been lined out. At that time what passed as policy
                    formulation was really just manipulation of nuances.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I was steered in the direction of China by a number of coincidences. One, running
                    into a friend in FSI who was taking Chinese language and who seemed to me to be
                    an incongruous choice for such a specialty. But he convinced me that it was a
                    ground floor from where there was nowhere to go but up. The whole region was
                    important to us but had not really been paid much attention to. There were lots
                    of good jobs out there and lots of responsibility. And then, of course, I looked
                    at Bohlen's record and he had made a very good career out of picking very early
                    on in his career a specialty that no one else had an eye on. He had decided,
                    rightfully so, that the United States was one day going to have to have a very
                    important relationship with Russia. He learned the language, did his homework
                    and labored in the vineyards, and he was right and rode that elevator right up
                    to the top. I thought that if he could do it maybe I could do it too as far as
                    China was concerned. It was with a certain amount of romanticism that I went
                    into it but, actually I found that the learning of the language was interesting
                    and the ability to ultimately communicate in Chinese to the Chinese people was
                    very satisfying to me and exciting, and I felt that the Department was giving me
                    something that they couldn't take away. It cost $50,000 in those days to train a
                    China specialist. I suppose it is six or eight times that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, in those days too there were a lot of younger
                        officers who had the same realization that you had that maybe the answer to
                        their career prospects was to learn a hard language such as Russian, Chinese
                        or Indonesian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, I felt a hard language represented a kind of rudder in the Service.
                    We were all supposed to be capable of serving anywhere but I felt the Windsor
                    assignment really kind of tore the scales from my eyes. I mean, it wasn't what
                    you knew it was what you could persuade the government to spend money on so that
                    they would have to justify that assignment to Congress that would move you in
                    the direction you wanted to go. So if you were a real cynic you would say, “Find
                    me a hard language specialty that is expensive and interesting and work at that,
                    make it happen and you will have a rudder in the Foreign Service.” And I think
                    it did work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, you also got assigned fairly quickly to deal
                        with China. You went to Hong Kong after Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>PLATT: I was very lucky because my predecessors at the language school, just a
                    year or two before I graduated, all went to the Hong Kong consular section. They
                    were very disappointed. They had all had a consular tour and felt that to go
                    through two years of language training and then end up with another consular
                    tour just wasn't fair, except for those who were consular specialists, who were
                    very few. This was a very competent bunch of people including Morton Abramowitz.
                    They bitched like hell and by the time my graduation came around the issue was
                    so neuralgic that they decided that they would take the new China language
                    graduates and put them in the more substantive jobs if they possibly could. I
                    found myself given a choice of jobs either in the domestic section that dealt
                    with Mainland domestic political affairs, or the external section which was
                    dealing with the Sino-Soviet polemics and was the hot topic of the time. I
                    lucked out in the sense that someone's father died and he had to leave and I
                    could take my choice. I chose internal politics and that was greeted with some
                    raised eyebrows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Marshall Green already...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Marshall Green had left already. I inherited his tailor. But Marshall was
                    gone and there were a number of other people who came along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Marshall came to Jakarta from the Department,
                        but his previous post had been Hong Kong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Right, and he was much liked there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jakarta didn't like him very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, neither did Henry. Marshall was always very forthright about his
                    views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that internal Chinese watching made you a
                        natural for intelligence and research watching the Asian countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>PLATT: Well, what it did was...I chose it because I wanted to use the language
                    that I had learned and this was the job that had the most language usage. I
                    would tell people who asked why I didn't want to go into the hotter topic,
                    “Well, I just want to learn the names of the players and find out what we are
                    all reporting on. I regard the China specialty not so much a thing in itself but
                    as an avenue to Asia and I would like to do that.” And I did. For a year it was
                    very, very mundane and I wrote dispatches that were mailed and were learned and
                    long and about things like the Party and the youth movement, birth control, etc.
                    But I learned the territory. Then the Cultural Revolution began about a year
                    later and after that, that became the hot topic and I found myself the main
                    analyst for domestic affairs on the Mainland. I was writing a cable every day
                    and clearing it with the consul general personally. I did that for three and a
                    half more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I went in 1968. First to the Desk and then became the head of the China
                    watchers community. I had the great benefit of having a boss, Ed Rice, who was
                    the consul general, who would let other people have their views. We had a basic
                    disagreement as to what was happening in China in the Spring of 1967. He asked
                    me to write a big long study of it which I did. It concluded that while there
                    was chaos on the Mainland and every city was engaged in factual fighting that if
                    Mao Zedong decided to do so, he could call the army in and quell this and bring
                    things back under control. The point of no return had not been reached yet,
                    although it was coming fast.</p>
                <p>Ed Rice disagreed. He felt that the point of no return had been reached and that
                    China was in kind of an inevitable downward spiral towards disintegration. I
                    went through four drafts of this with him and we argued and talked about every
                    aspect of it. In the end he said, “Well, this is a very good piece. I am not
                    going to change your view and I think that your view should go in as it stands.
                    But I want to append to it my own view.” I said, “Great,” knowing everybody
                    would read that. And it did go in and I then went on home leave. While I was on
                    home leave, Mao called in the military and restored law and order. So, I didn't
                    have to say, “I told you so,” I just wasn't there. Then I came back and we were
                    on to the next thing. When they were looking for a person to take over the China
                    watchers job in the Department, that gave me a leg up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got off into what looks like administration in
                        away, in the Executive Secretariat. Was that correct, or were you still in
                        the China watching business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>PLATT: In 1971, I had been working on China either as a language student or an
                    analyst for nine years. I was absolutely sick of it and sort of burned out and
                    my gorge would rise if I heard Mao Zedong, or some of these other names. The
                    managers of my career, such as they were, and it was basically me, felt that I
                    was too narrow and felt that the Inspectors all felt that I had been a prisoner
                    of the Cultural Revolution, and that I should have been doing other things. I
                    threw myself on the mercy of the system and asked them to find me something
                    else. I would be interested in administration, staff work, something that is
                    different and gives me a broad view of the Foreign Service and the Department.
                    The Secretariat is always looking for people who are competent in their fields
                    but want to broaden out and they asked me to come and work for them, which I did
                    very happily. I trotted around with Secretary Rogers to all of these various
                    different events; ran the Secretariat staffing programs for his daily work, etc.
                    It got a look at the way the Ops Center worked, although I didn't work in it. I
                    was working on the Line in the Secretariat Staff. I came to run it, Director of
                    the Secretariat Staff, in due course.</p>
                <p>The luck of it was that when Kissinger came back from China and started working
                    on the organization of the Nixon trip, they cut down the numbers that the
                    President took with him and the Secretary took with him. The Secretary was only
                    allowed to take with him one person from his immediate staff, including his
                    secretary, three interpreters, two substantive advisors and one administrative
                    person who would run the logistics of the whole trip. Rogers was first told that
                    the Executive Secretary is going to have to personally handle the management of
                    all of these briefing papers—the production of them, the clearance of them, the
                    brokerage of them with the White House, etc. The Executive Secretary was Ted
                    Elliott at the time who was a Middle Eastern, Central Asian specialist. He said,
                    “There is no way that I am going to do that, but Mr. Secretary I have a guy here
                    on your staff who knows these issues cold, who knows how to put these things
                    together and who could go with you on your trip.” “Oh.” Anyway, I was called
                    into the Secretary's office for an interview. I thought he might ask if I had
                    done anything that might embarrass him, etc. But he said, “I am looking for
                    someone as my executive assistant for the purposes of the trip. I can't take my
                    own one because he is a Latin American specialist. It would involve basically
                    four or five weeks preparing the papers, three weeks for the trip itself
                    possibly. Would you take this on?” “I would be delighted.” And I never would
                    have gotten the job if I had been in the East Asia Bureau. I was ushered to a
                    locked room by Ted Elliott. The door was unlocked and there were all my
                    colleagues sitting around at the Wang doing briefing papers. I was supposed to
                    answer all the questions about how these things were supposed to look, and what
                    they were supposed to say and what they were supposed to address.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Marshall still Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PLATT: Yes Marshall was still Assistant Secretary at that time and I worked very
                    closely with him. We put the things together. It was all very closely held. We
                    would go to meetings over at the White House and talk to the likes of Al Haig
                    and Win Lord and Henry Kissinger. Henry also ended up talking about the planning
                    of the trip. It was absolutely fascinating. I had a great time. I went on the
                    trip...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: It was January, 1972. That visit was an amazing visit and for someone like
                    myself it was a real eyeopener. I remember in Hawaii, first of all, taking
                    cables to the Secretary of State when we were stopping over just to get
                    ourselves kind of climatized, and I found myself sitting in on a lunch involving
                    Henry Kissinger and Marshall Green and William Rogers. It was very informal and
                    they were talking about how to manage the substance of the trip, the briefing of
                    the President and those kinds of things. It was interesting given the tenor of
                    the times and the gossip of the time. Everybody thought that Rogers didn't have
                    much of a role and that he was completely overshadowed by Kissinger, and I think
                    in many ways that was true, but what interested me was that during this
                    particular lunch whenever they talked about the substance of the Shanghai
                    Communique and the way to handle the issue between the two Chinas, etc.,
                    Kissinger did the talking and Marshall and Rogers did the listening. Whenever
                    they talked about how to sell this to Congress, how to brief the President and
                    how to get the President to deal with the Chinese approach to negotiation, it
                    was Rogers who did the talking and Kissinger who did the listening, at least in
                    the following sense. Let me give you one example. Kissinger said, “My experience
                    with the Chinese is that they come on very strongly and they treat their strong
                    positions as matters of principle. It is very important that you go back at them
                    just as strong and be very tough and very forthright. They will respect a person
                    for that. I don't think Nixon is going to do that because he is a lawyerly
                    person. He would prefer to sort of take that on, back off and come at it again
                    in sort of an elliptical way, come back around at it. So, Bill, when you have a
                    chance, I hope you will raise this with the President and advise him that this
                    is the way to deal with the Chinese.” I sensed in that less of a sense of
                    confidence on Kissinger's part as to who he was dealing with and how. And a
                    sense of comfort on Rogers part that he was the guy who could talk about these
                    things with Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably because of the common bond of the legal
                        background perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Oh, I think so and having a long background together. I also think that
                    Rogers was very much more attuned to Congress, the press and that kind of thing
                    as a Washington operator, and those were the things that he was asked to comment
                    on and give his views on.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>And I came away from my bird's eye view of this lunch feeling that wouldn't it
                    have been better if Rogers had ended up as Nixon's Presidential Advisor in the
                    White House and Kissinger as Secretary of State right off the bat. The answer is
                    probably yes, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kissinger was Nixon's Advisor at the time wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes. And there was this intense rivalry. Of course during the trip the
                    appointment with Mao Zedong came up very suddenly as these did given Mao's
                    health, and Rogers wasn't around and didn't go. Kissinger didn't stop and say,
                    “Go get Rogers,” they just went and Rogers wasn't included. That was a huge lost
                    of face for William Rogers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marshall went didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: No, I don't think he did. I think it was only Win Lord and the President
                    and Mao. This rankled but Rogers never let on. He was the total gent and very,
                    very comfortable with himself, a complete grownup in every way.</p>
                <p>It was fascinating for me to see how Zhou En-lai worked. He was in charge of the
                    whole trip. He did everything from the makeup of the Peoples Daily, and you
                    would see aides bringing him the front page proofs and he would move the
                    articles around. He would even do this at public events, at basketball games,
                    gymnastic events, etc. But Zhou En-lai, when we were in Shanghai, completely
                    unannounced came to call on William P. Rogers. We were in the Shanghai guest
                    house which is a big apartment building with an elevator that went to—there was
                    sort of one suite on each floor...I just went back there this May and I looked
                    at the place and it has been completely redone... But the elevator door opened
                    and there was Zhou En-lai, the Foreign Minister, and the Shanghai Revolutionary
                    Committee which later became known as the Gang of Four. They asked if William
                    Rogers was in and I went and knocked on his door. We were just unpacking after
                    having gotten in from Hanchou and said, “Mr. Secretary, Premier Zhou is here.”
                    “Oh,” he said, “I will be right out.”</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Well, you know how protocol conscious the Chinese are. Everything has to be
                    worked out way in advance. Anyway, we went into a nice sunny room in the suite
                    and sat down on big chairs. I looked at the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and
                    noticed one has very fancy leather boots. The old Foreign Minister has his long
                    underwear peeking out from under his pants, as all good long marchers did. And
                    Zhou had his interpreter, Nancy Tong, who later became one of Mao's oracles and
                    suffered for it. She was a Brooklyn girl born, brought up Chinese and a native
                    speaker of both languages. Zhou En-lai in the course of this impromptu tea went
                    through the history of China's opening to the United States seen from the
                    standpoint of the Chinese leadership. And he said that Mao Zedong was the first
                    one to notice Nixon's article in the Council of Foreign Relations' Foreign
                    Affairs magazine. He underlined the translation of this article that said that
                    we must make an opening to China, etc., as a way of giving ourselves more
                    flexibility. He said to read this because it was important. He then went on to
                    tell us that yes, China had its gold waters too, people who weren't any way
                    interested in dealing with the demon, himself. Anyway it was a very graceful and
                    interesting performance. When Rogers and I sat around and mused afterwards as to
                    what it was about, it was clearly him saying that he was sorry that Rogers had
                    gotten shortchanged and this was his way of making up for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: That was my interpretation and I think it was valid. Zhou was one of these
                    people who really paid a lot of attention to detail and was a very, very careful
                    and thorough going politician. I remember in Peking at a small dinner given for
                    Nixon and members of the delegations by their opposite numbers and nobody from
                    the outside, there were about 35 or 40 people all together, we were all standing
                    around having tea ahead of time and it was the first time that all the
                    delegations had been together, there were three delegations. Nixon and Zhou were
                    talking about politics. Henry Kissinger and his kind of opposite number were
                    negotiating the language of the Shanghai Communique. William Rogers and the
                    Foreign Minister, were talking about concrete measures to follow up—consular,
                    trade, facilitation—what to do next.</p>
                <p>We were standing around, it was the first time we had been together and the
                    President was over there in the corner talking, about that far away. Zhou En-lai
                    came up to me and said, “I understand that you know Chinese and I am planning to
                    give the toast to the President of the United States tonight and I want to do a
                    quotation from a poem by Chairman Mao which will set forth the benefits of
                    visits to the Great Wall. Tomorrow he will go to the Great Wall and this line
                    says that you don't become a man until you have been to the Great Wall. I hope
                    you think that is appropriate.” I said, “Well, yes, Mr. Premier Zhou, I think
                    that is very appropriate.” At that point Henry Kissinger came bursting right
                    between us on his way to the President who was over there. But Henry was very
                    uncomfortable about people on his delegations talking the language of the hosts
                    and talking to them directly, particularly their leaders and so, I sensed that
                    there was some plan in this.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>But the important thing to me was that Zhou had read the briefings carefully
                    enough to know that the junior most person engaged in any of these substantive
                    exchanges, the lowest note taker, and thought it was worth going up to talking
                    to this guy and that this might make a difference some day. It was indicative of
                    Zhou and the way he operated and why the Chinese were genuinely sad when he
                    died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He could see you were a comer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I don't know, but I did see him again when I went back, when the Liaison
                    Office was set up. So, all of this was very much grist for my mill. The last
                    night before the trip ended, I said to Rogers that I felt very strange because I
                    had met Zhou and some of these people but had never met the President of the
                    United States even though I was on his delegation. He said, “Well, you are
                    right. Come to this meeting. We are going to have a meeting in which Marshall
                    Green and John Holdridge will brief the President on their upcoming trip. After
                    he leaves for Alaska tomorrow they are going to go to Japan and Korea and the
                    Philippines, Taiwan and all of these places and tell them what happened. Why
                    don't you come and listen in.” “Oh, that would be great,” I said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this, Rogers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes. I had just said that I feel strange about this situation and he said
                    that I was right and should come to the meeting. So what I remember, of course,
                    is that I went to the meeting which was after the dinner and the Shanghai
                    Communique had been signed and I guess we were off for America the next day. It
                    was a great historic moment. I was a little early and only Rogers and Haldeman
                    were there and the President. Haldeman had his crew cut on and was writing on a
                    long legal yellow pad. Nixon was dressed in a flowered dressing gown over his
                    shirt and trousers. In one hand he had a big cigar and in the other he had a big
                    Scotch and soda. He was clearly enjoying the moment.John and Marshall came in
                    and proceeded to go around the region. The interesting thing to me was that it
                    was Nixon briefing them. He took each of the leaders and outlined an approach to
                    the leader based on his own knowledge of the leader and the way that leader
                    looked at these issues. When you talk to Sato in Japan I think you should
                    emphasis the following things because this is what his hang ups are. When you
                    talk to Pachohe [phonetic] it is different, this is what he is worried about.
                    Marcos, well, he really is only concerned with one thing. And it was a real tour
                    de force. He just went right around the horn. Of course, it strengthened from my
                    view my perception of him as the main foreign policy player. Henry Kissinger
                    played a very important role in putting it all together and making it happen
                    intellectually, but Nixon, himself, was no slouch.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he showed that too with his talks with Marshall in
                        Jakarta before he was President. They had a lot of very serious
                        conversations about China. Now, I don't know who was briefing who because I
                        wasn't there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So you got to the Liaison Office and George Bush was there...</p>
                <p>PLATT: No, George Bush was not there. I went there during the year that George
                    Bush was not there. I went there when we first opened up. I was asked to be in
                    the Liaison Office I guess on the strength of the fact that I had been on this
                    trip. I was scheduled to go to Japan, having asked for Japan because I didn't
                    think China would open up for a long time, to leave the Secretariat when I was
                    supposed to leave in the spring of 1973 and go to Japanese language training for
                    a year and then go to Tokyo and take the number two job in the political
                    section. And I did that.</p>
                <p>Well, I was called upon to go to China and be the head of the political section
                    when the Liaison Office blew up. What I mean by that is it became an immediate
                    reality, it suddenly blew up onto the horizon and I was asked to go. I thought
                    it would be an historical opportunity and broke the assignment to Japan. I went
                    and worked for a better part of a year with David Bruce. Bruce was the first of
                    our heads of the Liaison Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had forgotten that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes. He was a wonderful man and totally inexperienced in China, but he was
                    our senior most diplomat. It was a very strange office, I have to tell you,
                    because this first year there was amazing. The way I pieced it together, Henry
                    Kissinger told both John Holdridge and Al Jenkins that they would be the head of
                    the Liaison Office when it was ultimately opened, and I think that he meant it.
                    I think he perceived it as a small outfit with relatively low level leadership,
                    just, for example, as the liaison office we are setting up in Vietnam now, is
                    going to be. But the Chinese upped the ante by sending as head of their Liaison
                    Office their senior most diplomat. He had been ambassador four or five times and
                    was the one ambassador who had not been purged during the Cultural Revolution
                    and the one ambassador who was a member of the Central Committee. So Kissinger
                    had to respond and his response was to send our senior most diplomat who was
                    David Bruce. But in order to somehow do right by Holdridge and Jenkins he sent
                    them both as DCMs. We had two DCMs. We had ten officers. One chief, two
                    deputies, three kind of heads of sections and some number twos and that was
                    basically it. Well, it didn't work very well. The two DCMs canceled each other
                    out. And so the counselor level people basically ran the place. But we will let
                    that all come out in the wash.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>In any case I worked through that first year. I got involved in a fatal accident
                    which occurred in November. It was a broad daylight affair where I was driving
                    my family to the Great Wall and a young girl, a 15 year old, pedaled in front of
                    me. Just came right across my bow and I hit and killed her. I flagged down a
                    truck and put her on the back of the truck, with the language I could do all of
                    this, and took her to the hospital. It was the hospital that didn't deal with
                    heads, only with broken limbs, so I took her to another hospital and she died
                    there. The Chinese reacted to this in a very traditional way. After a month of
                    investigations they found me responsible and assessed the insurance for this,
                    damages to the family, etc. Then they called me in and said, “When a diplomat is
                    involved in a fatal accident he or she invariably leave of their own accord.” I
                    said, “Fine, I will be gone in a month.” They said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>If I had stayed and fought about it I would have ultimately left not of my own
                    accord. This has been a bone of contention amongst those who were working the
                    issues, but I convinced Holdridge and all the others, and they agreed with me
                    that this was the way to do it and that while we felt ill-used and that it was
                    not a fair judgment that it was the right way to manage it. In subsequent years,
                    the Germans had another similar situation in which someone who was trained as an
                    interpreter and had absolutely no other job alternatives got involved in a fatal
                    automobile accident and they fought it tooth and nail and in the end the person
                    was PNGed.</p>
                <p>So this is what we did. Kissinger was very kind to me. He was very supportive.
                    People were all wringing their hands and saying, “Here you are our coming China
                    guy and now you have to do something else.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were talking I can't help remember this
                        obituary. He must have been...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I knew him. He was a wonderful man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got a great write up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: He looked as nice as his picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He must have been involved because he was chief of
                        protocol wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: He ran the trip for Zhou. He was Zhou's right hand man. He was one of
                    their top diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you pronounce his name again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PLATT: Han Xu.</p>
                <p>But anyway I left and Kissinger said, “Well, you can have any job that you want
                    provided that there is a China element in it, because even if you say that this
                    is a traditional thing, I think that the way they have handled it deprives us
                    from your services and China experience and I don't want them to think that the
                    way they have handled that will have that impact. So you can take any job you
                    want but it has to have a China element.” I said, “Well, how about this job in
                    Tokyo. It is the senior job in the political section under the counselor, deals
                    with foreign policy, covers China's policy towards Japan and vice versa as well
                    as towards Korea, Southeast Asia, Russia, etc.” He said, “Fine.” So I went and
                    just did what I was going to do minus about a half year of language
                    training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have any language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I had a half year, but I really didn't need it for the job because it as
                    essentially a Foreign Office job and I was dealing Japanese diplomats who were
                    much more frank to me in English than they would have been in Japanese, which is
                    one of those true facts. I always found I was much more frank with the Chinese
                    when I was speaking their language because I felt nobody in my language could
                    understand what I was saying and furthermore to get down to the basics you had
                    to cut a lot of corners. You didn't have the nice nuances that enable you to
                    obfuscate the way we do. So the Japanese would tell me all kinds of things that
                    they wouldn't tell in Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I was in Tokyo almost four years and I became thoroughly embedded in the
                    US-Japanese relations and the life in Japan. I really enjoyed it and the family
                    really enjoyed it. It was a lot easier place to live than Beijing. The Japanese
                    were a lot easier to deal with than the Chinese. And the contrasts were so
                    marked. It was to me so interesting to have a full hands on experience in both
                    countries. I had wanted that long before the Liaison Office position came up. I
                    really thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the language training a great therapy from
                    all the difficulties we had been through in China. It was just like going out
                    and sawing wood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went back to Washington, I gather, around
                        1978?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PLATT: I went back to Washington in 1977 to the Japan Desk. I was lucky. They
                    were looking for a Japan country director and there were people more senior than
                    me who had more Japan experience. The new Assistant Secretary was Dick Holbrooke
                    who was a younger guy who was not attracted to the older Japan hands who were
                    served up to him as possible Japan country directors. He asked me, who he knew,
                    I had known him for years, whether I would like the job, and I said, “Yes.” I
                    was an FSO-3 and it was an FSO-1 job, so I grabbed it. I spent a year and a half
                    doing that. It was during Mansfield's first year. Then I spent two years working
                    for Brzezinski on Japan and Korea on the NSC. I really spent my time persuading
                    President Carter to leave the troops in Korea. I did that in a variety of
                    elliptical bureaucratic ways. Then I went over to the Defense Department to work
                    for a year for Harold Brown.</p>
                <p>The Carter years for me were very instructive because I had a chance to deal with
                    the same set of issues but from three different bureaucratic points of view—the
                    State Department, the White House and Defense Department. We had a kind of round
                    robin going in which people at the deputy assistant secretary level, all of whom
                    knew each other, were taking these jobs one after the other. So we had a very
                    tight coordination mechanism in which each of us were able to represent our
                    institutions and their points of view, but not with the suspicions that came
                    from not knowing each other and what you were dealing with. So, when Vance,
                    Brzezinski or Brown were talking to each other about an issue that couldn't be
                    decided at a lower level, they not only knew what they were supposed to say from
                    their own institution's point of view, they knew what the other institutions
                    were thinking. So it worked very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been exciting. How did you get involved in
                        the international organization field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, that was serendipitous. What happened was, Jimmy Carter lost the
                    election and ISA in the Defense Department was struck like a tent. That is what
                    happens in ISA. The State Department maintains its ziggurat as do the various
                    different service organizations in the Pentagon. But the civilian foreign policy
                    establishment in the Pentagon is considered a major patronage institution and
                    therefore is reshaped, taken down and put back up again every time. So I was out
                    of a job. But the person who replaced me was Rich Armitage, who I had known a
                    little bit, but who I got to know better. I gave him some good pointers about
                    how to get established and get going and made a friend of him early on. But I
                    was a senior Foreign Service officer experienced in the ways of the Department
                    who had worked in the White House, in the Defense Department, the
                    Secretariat...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been around the bases, so to speak.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PLATT: I had been around the bases. I was sort of a hired gun looking for
                    somebody who needed my services and it turned out to be Elliott Abrams who was
                    coming on board as Assistant Secretary for International Organizations. I told
                    him, “Look, I don't know anything about international organizations or the UN,
                    but I do know a lot about the bureaucracy and the foreign policy establishment
                    and how things work in Washington.” He said, “As far as I am concerned, not
                    knowing about the UN is not a drawback for us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you like the international field once you got into
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, I did a survey of the issues that the International Organizations
                    Bureau worked on for Elliott, who was very bright and who I liked. He turned out
                    to be a controversial guy, but I found him a lot of fun to work with. He needed
                    the kind of information and knowledge that I had. He was a very young guy and
                    Jeane Kirkpatrick was the PermRep up there. So it was a complicated job
                    requiring all the diplomatic skills I could muster.</p>
                <p>What I told Elliott after having looked over the field of issues that we dealt
                    with, “In the International Organizations Bureau and the UN in general you have
                    a wide variety of patronage jobs and a wide variety of jobs to fill and that's
                    why it is kind of politically interesting to a political appointee. As far as
                    creativity is concerned, doing some actual policy formulation, if that is what
                    you are interested in, the only area in which there is potential for this is in
                    Africa, the Namibia issue, because that is the only one which is really cooking
                    now. The rest of the time we are sweeping up after either the Israelis or the
                    South Africans and dispensing a fair amount of assistance here and there. So,
                    you should get yourself involved in all of those meetings involving Chet
                    Crocker, involving Secretary Haig and others. I will help you with the rest. You
                    get on to Chet's team because there is a very valid IO/UN element to that whole
                    settlement and there is a very valid African one, and this is a joint venture.”
                    And he did.</p>
                <p>A few months later he was asked to become the new Assistant Secretary for Human
                    Rights. He was somebody who cared deeply about those things and convinced the
                    Reagan administration that they had to have one because the Carter
                    administration had one and if they didn't it would look like they didn't care.
                    So they said, “Okay, baby, you are it.” And he went. And I found myself acting
                    assistant secretary for a good seven months until they found another political
                    appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PLATT: I will think of his name in a second. He was a young Mormon, a very nice
                    guy who had worked in the White House scheduling office. He was very competent,
                    very friendly, very nice. He was brand new and knew nothing about international
                    organizations. But I got him through the process and then went on to Zambia as
                    ambassador. I had done exactly what I told Elliott to do. Elliott had gotten
                    himself firmly entrenched in all of the negotiations with the South Africans,
                    the Europeans, the Angolans, the Namibians..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Lusaka was the headquarters for the front line
                        states, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: That's right, at that time. So Chet asked me, “Would you like to go to
                    Lusaka as ambassador? You and I know each others moves and I would have a person
                    who has regional clout and who knows these issues so I won't have to go there
                    every time there is something to say. Obviously I will come for the important
                    things, but I would like you to go there and be that as well as the bilateral
                    ambassador.” I said, “Fine.” I was delighted to do that. So it was one of those
                    Foreign Service things that happen. You trade on your experience, you find a new
                    niche and you take it where it will lead you. Well, it led me to Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It led you to Africa and the Namibia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I was very pleased to have that opportunity. I was around for the
                    negotiation of withdrawal of South African from Angola, which lasted for about a
                    year and was a precursor to other agreements that came later. I loved working
                    with Chet Crocker, who I think is one of the really tough, resilient people who
                    has worked on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sure you got to meet Ahti Saari?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I knew Ahti Saari but haven't seen him since he became President of
                    Finland. I would love to go call on him at some point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is quite a guy. I worked with him on certain aspects of
                        the Namibia at the UN Mission, UNTAG as we called it for years. It was all
                        laid out in 1978 but it wasn't until several years later that it came to
                        pass.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I think there was almost a Namibian agreement at the time of...when was
                    it, 1978?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, 1978 was when the Security Council resolution was
                        adopted that set up the whole thing on the expectation that it would be
                        implemented.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>PLATT: I remember going in my capacity as Japan Desk officer going up and sitting
                    in on conversations between Cy Vance and the Japanese leaders and talking about
                    UNTAG. And, of course, I had UNTAG in huge quantities later on when they tried
                    to figure out what it should be and how many people, etc. We never got to use it
                    while I was around.</p>
                <p>But that is why I went to Africa. I went to Africa because I went into
                    International Organizations Affairs and I went into International Organizations
                    Affairs because a young, raw, political appointee in that field wanted an
                    experienced hand who was close enough to his age so there was some
                    connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Zambia you went back to the Department and took over
                        the Executive Secretariat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: This again is one of those things that happens when... The person who put
                    my name before George Shultz was Charles Hill. Charlie Hill was the guy who was
                    my main help in analyzing Mainland affairs in Hong Kong in 1966. He and I were
                    friends and had kept up with each other. We had gone on to others things and
                    different things. But he knew me to be a bureaucrat in the positive sense of the
                    word, in the constructive sense of the word, as well as a diplomat. Charlie Hill
                    was both Shultz's Executive Secretary and his Executive Assistant, which is Mr.
                    Inside and Mr. Outside simultaneously and that is really too hard even for a
                    workaholic like Charlie. He was always after Shultz to get an Executive
                    Secretary. Shultz said he wouldn't do it until after the election. So the minute
                    the reelection occurred, Hill was on the phone to me and said, “Would you like
                    to do this even though you still have another six months as ambassador? You
                    would have to come back early.” I said, “Sure, I would like to do it.” That was
                    the job I had always liked the look of. I was thoroughly familiar with the
                    Secretariat and the way it looked. Shultz, himself, had an approach to it that
                    was very close to my ideal of the job. And my sister was dying. All those things
                    were happening at the same time. So, I saw this as an opportunity of being home
                    during a very difficult period and also a job I wanted to have. So I did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it seems to me you had some children who were coming
                        along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Oh, they were all out of the nest and had lives of their own far away from
                    us.</p>
                <p>So, I went back and the deal with Shultz was you work for two years and then go
                    on to something else. And that is the way it should be in that job where you get
                    to work at 6:45am and go home at 8:00pm five days a week and then come in for
                    five hours on Saturday and two hours on Sunday, and do that for two years. Then
                    you go on to your reward.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you got a pretty good reward, I would say,
                        Manila.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, the job, itself, was very well worth doing, reward or no and I was
                    very fortunate to have Shultz. He really wanted to use the Foreign Service and
                    the State Department bureaucracy the way it was set up. The various Secretaries
                    have had different approaches. Dulles, Baker and others brought their staffs in
                    and wanted to have something set apart. They would use the building as needed,
                    but basically they didn't have much confidence in the machinery as it was set
                    up. Shultz arrived the day he came to work in 1982 with a battered professor's
                    grip and said, “Let's go to work.” He didn't even change secretaries. That was
                    how he started and we worked out a system with him where by he got to see a lot
                    of people each day, just for a short period of time, so that they would feel
                    that they were plugged into the Secretary of State. Charlie Hill took care of
                    the Mr. Inside stuff and I took care of the Mr. Outside stuff. I plugged the
                    Secretary into the bureaucracy and Charlie made sure that the quality of what he
                    received was really good. We worked very closely together with a lot of overlap.
                    The people in the Department felt well used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shultz was a pretty popular Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: In every sense of the word. When Shultz left there was an enormous
                    outpouring. The lobby was packed. He was a rather stolid figure but he came
                    across as somebody who really cared and who understood about ideas and
                    understood what all these people did all day long. And they looked out for him,
                    they protected him. They would not let things come up and bit him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did what you were getting paid to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: And I think that is right. It is a lot easier with a Secretary who wants
                    to use the machinery as constituted and will take you into his confidence...and
                    throw you out the minute you betray him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then off to Manila. I guess you had a particularly big
                        issue there with the bases, which came up in your tenure didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PLATT: Yes. There were two major issues. One was the survival of the government
                    and the other was the future of the bases. It made for a very, very complicated
                    and difficult assignment. I arrived, presented my credentials in three days and
                    two days later there was a major coup attempt. Gringo Honasan tried to overthrow
                    the government. I got to know the members of the government really fast. My job
                    was to try to make sure that Mrs. Aquino held her job without making it look
                    like we were doing very much. And that was very hard to do. There was another
                    big coup attempt in December in which we flew planes from Clark that were
                    essentially a demonstration. But I went through major shell and shot in our
                    efforts to support that government. And at the same time to fashion a bases
                    agreement that would work and develop a constituency in the Philippines that
                    would support it. My feeling was that in the new democracy, if you could fashion
                    a really clear consensus in keeping that basing arrangement throughout the
                    country that the Philippine Senate would have to obey it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were the ones who eventually rejected it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Right. And I was successful in creating that consensus. We traveled all
                    over the country and opened schools, etc. and I felt like a domestic politician.
                    I was kissing babies and doing all those things. And I liked it. I thought it
                    was interesting. It was dangerous, but interesting. I was on the top of the New
                    Peoples Army hit list, and the Right didn't like me either. So security was
                    always an element of concern. And the government was wobbly and there were a lot
                    of natural disasters. It was a time that Job was born to deal with. So we dealt
                    with it. When I left 3 years and 11 months later, which is the record for an
                    American ambassadorship in the Philippines...I was longer there than anybody,
                    including Hank Byroade who was there for 3 years and 8 months. I am the holder
                    of that record, enviable or not. When I left we did have an agreement, which was
                    subsequently rejected by the Philippine Senate. And I dare say in the context of
                    the Cold War ending and 80 American bases being closed in the United States the
                    following year, our own Senate would have had trouble with it too. But that was
                    then and this is now. I felt that the most important indication that my
                    ambassadorship had meant something...it really didn't occur until after I had
                    been gone for over a year...was when she handed over to a duly elected
                    successor. Then I could say to myself, “This trip was worthwhile.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't she want to run again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>PLATT: She never wanted to run again. She felt that she had an historical duty to
                    lead her country through the transition from a dictatorship to democracy. She
                    felt that she had no choice, that this was the legacy of her husband's
                    assassination, that there was really nobody else who could do it. She had this
                    sense of divine calling as far as that was concerned. She was not good at
                    governing. She was very good at hanging in. She was very brave and tough. She
                    performed best when she was under fire. But when she wasn't under fire and there
                    was this or that particular bill to be gotten through congress or decision to be
                    brokered through the various agencies, it wasn't easy for her. She wasn't able
                    to show the gratitude that one would have expected one to show to a foreign
                    government. You would have expected that her government would have been much
                    less equivocal about bases negotiations, etc., but the fact of the matter was
                    that our help and our support and our being there during earthquakes and
                    volcanoes, etc. just made it harder for them. It put them under more pressure to
                    show that they were not being taken for granted and standing up to the Yankees,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go from Manila directly to Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes, directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: About a year and a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then Benazir was out when you got there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes, Benazir was out when I got there. I think I was picked for the job
                    because I had a proven track record as a person who could deal successfully with
                    inexperienced women heads of government in new democracies. I am serious. There
                    is no other reason they would have thought of me for Pakistan. I am not a Muslim
                    specialist, although I have China connections and that is one of their strong
                    peripheral relationships. So, in terms of size of mission it was fine but I
                    think the connection in somebody's mind was the qualifications that had been
                    established in Manila, which were not area qualifications. But, by the time I
                    got there it was an all male orchestra, which was fine. I enjoyed Pakistan a
                    lot. I didn't change anything. I may have improved the tone of our relationship
                    a little bit, but that was something that was going to happen with the passage
                    of time. We didn't make any progress on the nuclear issues, we didn't make any
                    progress on really any issues, as far as I could tell. We dealt with the cut off
                    in aid, we tried to make the best of a difficult situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is aid still cut off?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>PLATT: Aid is still cut off, but there are certain kinds of aid that we can
                    provide. But it was valuable to me because I got a look at another part of Asia
                    and got an introduction to South Asia that really interested me. I spent quite a
                    lot of time traveling in Pakistan. I got around to all the various parts of
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to Kashmir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Well, I got to the part of Kashmir that the Pakistanis administer. And I
                    got all over the country. I thought it extremely interesting and exotic. It was
                    the year that the Soviet Union broke up and the Afghanistan war ended and the
                    mujahideen left Peshawar and went back to Afghanistan and started fighting
                    against each other. But it was a kind of watershed year. It was a very good
                    place to be watching from. I literally saw the Soviet Union collapse in front of
                    our eyes. The war come to an end and start up again in a new form. We were the
                    ones who were providing all of the assistance for Afghanistan. We were in effect
                    the embassy for Afghanistan, if you wanted to call it that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Right, we saw a lot of them. More than that the rulers of the various
                    Central Asian republics who suddenly came to power as the head of sovereign
                    states totally unexpected from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
                    Uzbekistan suddenly appeared on our doorstep blinking like moles coming out into
                    the sunlight. We, as diplomats, would be called to the tarmac, usually at very
                    short notice, to meet another of these leaders and listen to another totally
                    unknown national anthem being butchered by the local bands, and here these guys
                    came. They all looked like kind of Mongols in Eastern European suits, which in
                    effect they were. They were Tartars with Russian tailors.</p>

                        of them is what do you think was your most significant accomplishment in
                        your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>PLATT: I always liked history and I always thought going into the Foreign Service
                    gave a person a crack at history either to be a fly on the wall or an actual
                    actor in a history relationship in a country. By those lights, my time in the
                    Philippines was the most significant aspect of what I did. In the since that I
                    was able to make decisions and bring to bare its influence which I think kept
                    democracy on an even keel during a very difficult period in that country. I am
                    not saying I did it single handed, I am just saying that I was there to help a
                    government that was having a very, very difficult time. There were so many near
                    things that I think if I hadn't played the role that I had they might have
                    succumbed to a banana republic's fate or something like that. I would not toot
                    my horn that way in public, but I would say it to you.</p>
                <p>I think in terms of world history significance, what I witnessed in China was
                    much more important. I feel that I have had at various strategic points a role
                    in the US relations with China. First as an analyst as to what was going on.
                    Then in Washington where what we did was to lay the analytical groundwork for
                    the opening. In other words, explained what it was the Chinese were doing in
                    response to the Russians in 1969, which led to the gestures that they took
                    vis-a-vis the Nixon administration and led ultimately to the opening. I am
                    saying that we recognized what others recognized and identified it. So I had a
                    little piece of that action and a tiny piece of trip action, tiny piece of
                    action in the Liaison Office. And then in the Defense Department while I was
                    there I spent a lot of time that particular year docking for the first time
                    since the Korean War the US and the Chinese military establishments. So taken as
                    a kind of sweep, I felt that I was lucky to be participating in that very, I
                    think, important retooling of a major relationship. But I didn't have a major
                    role in it. I had a major role in a much lesser arena in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think will happen, with Taiwan and China both
                        applying for membership in GATT, which will shortly be the World Trade
                        Organization? How do you see that developing? I don't see how we are going
                        to have a two China policy in reality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I think both of them will join the GATT, or the WTO. Taiwan will have been
                    there earlier and China will get in. Perhaps not this time but some of their
                    behavior and trade policy are not up to standard. But they will ultimately get
                    in. Taiwan and China are members of a lot of international organizations
                    together...the IGU, the Asian Development Bank, etc. So they should be able to
                    solve the situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let me ask you a question that I ask all the Foreign
                        Service career people I have interviewed. It is a sensitive subject, really,
                        the relationship between the State Department and the Foreign Service on the
                        one hand and the Central Intelligence Agency on the other. I must say my own
                        experience in the Foreign Service led me to have a very low opinion of the
                        product of the CIA from what I could see.I wasn't in political work but I
                        never thought they came up with very much. The record was replete with
                        disasters on the part of the CIA, including the over estimates of the
                        strength of the former Soviet Union. I am not talking about them all and the
                        Ames case, but one wonders if this might not, I am sure you have experienced
                        this in your career...I have found going around as an American, former
                        Foreign Service, years with the UN, always in an international atmosphere,
                        but talking, of course, to a lot of Americans, the CIA was a millstone
                        around our neck. I never understood why the name wasn't changed fifteen or
                        twenty years ago. Today I don't understand why there isn't a strong move on
                        part of the administration to just shut it down. I realize there are a lot
                        of Foreign Service people who think that there are some good things that
                        they do in the Agency. But I don't know. My own feeling is that we certainly
                        would be better off to at least change the name and cut it way back. Would
                        you have any feelings that you would like to express on this subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I always worked very closely with people in the Agency. I worked starting
                    off in Hong Kong where we were all in the same business, which was essentially
                    analyzing what was going on in China. We fought like cats and dogs about
                    analytical conclusions, etc. We were just as right as they were if not
                    righter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is my impression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: But the main thing that they did for us was to provide a whole range of
                    technical means of checking out our own conclusions, and what we did for them
                    was to provide them with a lot of human intelligence in addition to cover for
                    what they were doing. Now, I felt that there was a role there, but it was more
                    of a coordinating role throughout the entire intelligence community. It was very
                    important that there be a center of gravity. I got a very much better sense of
                    the Agency's value when I was ambassador in the Philippines because they really
                    basically kept me safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean personal security?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PLATT: Right. Intelligence is an enormously important element in a dicey security
                    situation. These guys were very sophisticated about surveillance. They had
                    people who watched the watchers. These guys would check you out from time to
                    time to see if you were being surveiled. They could tell just like that. They
                    also had big networks of people who had infiltrated the other institution, the
                    Communist Party. So they could tell me, “You are on the top of the list but they
                    are not looking at you right now because you are too hard a target.” The way we
                    dealt with personal safety was never to give them a schedule that they could
                    operate with and never to give them an opportunity to make a hit without getting
                    involved in a fire fight. The good thing about Filipino terrorists is they are
                    extremely expert and very deft, they like to have the whole thing so planned out
                    that they can go and shoot their person down in the marketplace and then go home
                    and watch the basketball game. They are much easier to deal with as a result
                    then the people who feel that dying while shooting you is going to send them to
                    heaven. So we would hear through the network that they are looking for you now,
                    be particular careful not to be doing anything the same time in a given week,
                    etc. Then I would go down to the range and shoot off a pistol and some shotguns
                    and some uzis, just so it would get around that even if they penetrated all
                    these other things, that I knew what I was doing with firearms. This was just to
                    add another deterrent purely for show. I never could have fired one of those
                    things in a car and still kept my hearing, there was just no way one could do
                    that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I worked very closely with the Agency and they were extremely good at
                    this. I think you have to have an intelligence agency to stay safe as a nation,
                    including as an individual. And I think you get into trouble when it gets too
                    big and too public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that the situation we are in now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I think that is right. I think you would find amongst the most dedicated.
                    There is this division in the house, there are three divisions. One is the
                    analysts, and their analysts are no better than anybody else and in some ways
                    they are worse because they don't move. State Department analysts can be moved
                    and have a flow through system so that when, as happens in a lot of academic
                    institutions, the disagreements over policy and analysis become hatreds you can
                    change that by getting rid of everybody and sending them off to London or
                    Mogadishu, etc. They couldn't do that at the Agency so they had a bunch of
                    analysts who were cross with each other and the DEA and State. These guys spend
                    more time in arguments with them then they would in dealing with the issues,
                    themselves. But that happens in every intelligence community. If you read Le
                    Carr� carefully all this stuff rings true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The only person who was ever important in the British
                        consulate general in Hamburg was John Le Carr� and I never met him. He was
                        there part of the time I was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>PLATT: Well, I was never in Hamburg, but I do know him from subsequent
                    reincarnations that have nothing to do with work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you probably saw the op-ed piece in the Times a
                        couple of days ago by some former CIA staff member who recommends using the
                        British model which is to have two separate agencies, one for analysis and
                        one for operations. Making two agencies strikes me as going in the wrong
                        direction. In other words I do wish they would at least change the name of
                        the CIA because everywhere you go this is all you hear in any country, “It
                        is the doing of the CIA.” Now, you and I know that isn't true. But it has
                        been true often enough so that is the general impression. I think we suffer
                        for it. I think our image suffers for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: But it would have anyway. It came from a period when CIA was a very
                    important operating arm in the fifties and sixties period. It was the OSS in new
                    clothing, the same guys. I think it needs to be recast. Whatever name you gave
                    it or cover you gave it, it ultimately would get out and that would be blamed
                    whatever it was called. But I think you have to have some covert collection
                    techniques in order to stay safe. You have to supplement your normal diplomatic
                    intelligence with covert intelligence to keep that capability. It is just a fact
                    of life. It is something that countries have always found necessary. Ever since
                    there have been entities who cared about their safety you have had people who
                    acted in secret to find out what was going on amongst the people who they dealt
                    with. Then you had overt people who did that too in the form of envoys. You have
                    to have it. Now, there is a whole new element that has been added and that is
                    the technological side. The technological role in the intelligence world is
                    very, very important to our ability to make policy and stay safe. And it has got
                    to be run by somebody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I haven't been terribly impressed by the quality of people
                        who have been running it so far.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes, but the quality of the information that comes out of those channels
                    is very, very high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Technological channels you mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have seen a lot of NSA product that I didn't think was

                <p>PLATT: But that is the analysts.</p>

                        basically. That is the stuff I think we are spending an awful lot of money
                        for which I don't think is worth it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PLATT: I don't think that you or I are going to succeed in dismantling this. But
                    I did get a good look at its strengths and its weaknesses and I think that there
                    are weaknesses and I think there are things that can be cut and reduced. But I
                    think you have to have an intelligence component to your national security
                    apparatus. I am happy that the Department of State doesn't get blamed for all
                    these bad things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mr. Ambassador, I think we have taxed your patience
                        long enough and unless you have some other comments that you would like to
                        volunteer, I will be happy to say that we have reached the end of the
                        interview. I appreciate it very much.</hi>
