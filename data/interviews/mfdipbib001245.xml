                <p>MARY LOUISE WEISS:</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Monique Wong</p>
                <p>Interview Date: August 1992</p>
                <p>This is Monique Wong on August 13, 1992. I'm going to be interviewing Mary Louise
                    Weiss at home for the Foreign Service Spouse Oral History, Incorporated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Louise, you and your husband entered the foreign
                        service in 1956 under something called the Wriston program. Can you tell me
                        a little bit more about that program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, that's what was called Wristonization in the foreign service. Prior
                    to that the foreign service basically was posted abroad for almost unlimited
                    lengths of time. They didn't have home leaves so they weren't allowed to come
                    home. The spent a lot of time abroad and evidently were not required to come
                    back at regular intervals. As a result, they somewhat lost touch with the
                    updating of American society and official workings in the department.</p>
                <p>Wristonization was to change all that by setting up a kind of revolving personnel
                    system. Foreign service officers abroad had an opportunity on a regular basis,
                    every two years, to come back to the department and go right into jobs that were
                    foreign policy related.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, somewhat like an exchange program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: In a way, a revolving one. So the people in the department who were
                    filling those jobs that the foreign service coming back would have to fit into,
                    the personnel here, the civil service personnel, were told they had to decide if
                    they wanted to become foreign service or not. If they did, they would be
                    assigned abroad on a rotating basis. If they did not, they would be in jeopardy
                    of losing their position or being bumped in the job they were holding when a
                    foreign service officer would be returned to Washington. They'd have to find a
                    place for him. The civil servant's career and job were really in jeopardy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in other words, your husband was a civil servant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WEISS: He was in the civil service. He was in the State Department for, I guess,
                    about 12 years, in the economic part of it, international trade. And at that
                    time we had just moved into a new house. We had a new baby and a little child,
                    and we weren't quite mentally prepared for this sudden decision. So it took us a
                    while. I think we had about a year to decide., and it was back and forth. Every
                    night or so we made a different decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a difficult decision for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: It was somewhat difficult domestically, you might say. But, on the other
                    hand, we had always thought that perhaps in the future we would be interested in
                    foreign service, so there was that aspect also. And our friends were having to
                    make decisions, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your friends in the foreign service. I mean, in the civil
                        service</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I remember long conversations on the phone with Janet _______, for
                    example, who was in the same position, little children. So we [debated] with
                    each other, yes and no for quite a while, and finally we decided yes.</p>
                <p>Then, being brand new at all of this, we had to learn about what do we do with
                    the house. As I look back on it and read some of the material, it seems to me
                    that it was no more of an adjustment than any new foreign service wife like
                    yourself and your husband going to a first post. It's an adjustment. You adapt.
                    It's new. It's strange. You don't know what's ahead for you. For a while you
                    don't know what post you're going to get. So having that decision made, I think
                    it was no different for me than for a new foreign service officer in the old
                    days, or even now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sort of help from, perhaps, talking to
                        foreign service wives or family in preparation for your decision or going
                        overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, there was some of that. There's much more now, but there was a wives'
                    course at the Foreign Service Institute. It was more social, socially oriented,
                    a panel of senior foreign service wives. How many glasses should she take? That
                    sort of thing. We got a lot of protocol on calling and calling cards and that
                    sort of thing, and entertaining. There were no offers for language study at that
                    time. Nothing really more substantive. So I think that we used post reports. It
                    was on a much smaller scale than is now available at the briefing center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there were some post reports at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WEISS: There were post reports, and I think also that the new wife would write to
                    her counterpart at the post. Len was going to be the economic counselor in
                    Belgrade. So I wrote to the wife there and asked questions about the schools,
                    about clothing, entertaining, things that might not be in the post report that
                    would be more personal. And I think we did that in other posts. It was a nice
                    thing to do. It introduced you to someone before you arrived. I think we wrote
                    to the ambassador's wife as kind of a courtesy thing so that when we arrived,
                    there was a little connection.</p>
                <p>I had a cousin, Janet Barker, who had gone into the foreign service herself right
                    after she graduated from Vassar; and she had twin daughters and she'd been in
                    the foreign service, by this time in the 50s, she'd been to several posts, and
                    she gave me a lot of very helpful advice about traveling by boat and what to
                    take when you have little children. If you're going to have your car on the boat
                    and you're driving to the post, which we did, we drove from Naples to Belgrade,
                    and things to take in the car for the children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get back to the Wriston program, did you feel a sense,
                        any kind of separation between the group of Wristonees and the group of
                        foreign service families?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I felt some of that before we went, and your previous question reminded me
                    of other ways that I and other new Wriston wives learned a little bit about the
                    service, and that is, the Association of Foreign Service Women had monthly
                    meetings and they were more or less social. They were luncheons. I remember at
                    those, at one of them in particular, the new wives were asked to sit at tables
                    where there would be at least one senior foreign service, maybe an ambassador's
                    wife who was here either on leave or assigned, so that we could ask them
                    questions. I found with one person I talked to a little bit of a condescending
                    air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From a foreign service wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, but she'd been in a long time. She didn't know me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think that's the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, I think it's a natural feeling that, you know, here comes a new
                    crowd, and they're going to change everything. We're used to the way it used to
                    be and we have our ways. I can't explain it otherwise. I think it's just a
                    psychological, natural way to react.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you treated differently at all as a Wristonee in
                        terms of how you were compensated, how you get assigned for posts or
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WEISS: I don't know about the assignments. I couldn't answer that one. I felt
                    that going to our first post as a wife of a counselor was coming in at a good
                    level. It wasn't the highest; it wasn't the lowest. It was upper mid-level. I
                    was a wife and mother. I wasn't brand new, young. But I was naive in other ways
                    about the foreign service. I didn't find in Belgrade any kind of condescension
                    or difference. I think that was part of my naivet�. Maybe they felt it, but I
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Riddleberger was our ambassador's wife, and she was very welcoming and very
                    warm. A very nice woman. There was no women's club. I liked all the wives I met,
                    all the _______ wives. They were more or less at my level.</p>
                <p>But we arrived at the time when the inspectors were there. We didn't have a
                    house, and we didn't have an apartment yet. We were living in a hotel. The
                    inspectors were in the same hotel. We'd just arrived that week. We'd see them at
                    dinner in the hotel and so on. We were told that the morale amongst the women in
                    the embassy, women who were already there, was very low. Other women had been
                    reporting to the inspectors how bad things were. In Yugoslavia, it was a
                    communist country. There was a language problem, a cultural problem, a political
                    problem. All these isolating factors. At the top level I detected that they were
                    all foreign-born wives. Mrs. Riddleberger was away from post a good bit of the
                    time. She had to go to the dentist. She went back to Holland _________. The
                    DCM's (Deputy Chief of Mission) wife was French. The agricultural attach�s wife
                    was Italian. She would spend a lot of time in Bologna. The AID (Agency for
                    International Development) director's wife lived in Paris and she almost never
                    came to the post. So the top level of senior women who you would expect would
                    kind of lead, help the new wives, or lead a group or something, were not there a
                    good bit of the time, and therefore were not that aware that this was a strange
                    place to come to for the first time.</p>
                <p>So we found that at more our own level than at the senior level we got clues from
                    women who were experienced. One woman — they had just come from a posting in
                    Iran — and she complained about the housing. She said, “The housing here is
                    terrible. It was all owned by the government, controlled” and so on. She said,
                    “In Tehran we had our own swimming pool!” She was spoiled. So she contrasted
                    Belgrade with her previous post. But she was an experienced wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But for you it was different because it was your first
                        post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I had nothing to compare it with, and I think that was an advantage.
                    Nothing to compare it with. I'd been overseas during the war, but that was a
                    very different situation. So I sort of took everything as it came along.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>David, our four-year-old son, was too young for school, so there was a little
                    nursery school run by, I think, a Yugoslav woman who spoke English. And other
                    little American children attended, and some British. Susan was in third grade in
                    the international school, which was very small. The school was housed in a villa
                    that previously had been the residence of the AID director. The school had
                    enlarged and needed a bigger place, so the community decided this is the best
                    place. It had some nice grounds.</p>
                <p>That was a little UN also because the children were from all the embassies,
                    mostly. They had very little international business at the time, so they were
                    mostly diplomats and not all English-speaking. But she loved it, and her teacher
                    was an American and she was also the principal of the school. They did some
                    lovely things there. It was kind of primitive in a way, but that was, I think,
                    as much a part of her education as anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your choice of the word “primitive” made me think of the
                        fact that you were living in a communist country in 1957. Now, what was it
                        really like? You already alluded to a few of those things: school for
                        children and so on. I'm curious as an overall kind of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I didn't feel frightened by it. A few incidences later were a bit
                    frightening, but they didn't touch me or us personally except that we knew we
                    were bugged. We had to be very careful about what we said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. In your apartment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: In our house. Well, in the apartment and then later. We got a house after
                    about a year. We all knew that. And we all knew that our servants. . . . We had
                    a live-in cook. The cook commuted and we had a live-in maid, and we knew that
                    they were obligated to report to the police whom we entertained, who our guests
                    were. That didn't frighten me. We didn't do or say anything that was out of
                    order I didn't feel.</p>
                <p>When we were traveling — I took many trips with my husband when he went on
                    official tours around the country — we knew that we were followed. That was
                    routine. It affected us in a way that you had to be careful what you said and
                    did all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who you associated with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WEISS: Well, I guess so. The Yugoslav officials with whom Len dealt were not
                    allowed to entertain in their own homes. Never. There was one exception and that
                    was an interesting one, a man who was a _______. But we were told by, I think,
                    the DCM, _______ Markey, had been in another post and made friend with a
                    Yugoslav official, and when they both were assigned to Belgrade, this official
                    cut him off socially in the sense that he never reciprocated entertaining. It
                    was all very official entertaining; it wasn't personal. You couldn't really get
                    personal. You couldn't invite them to your tennis club or have them for a picnic
                    or whatever.</p>
                <p>It was very interesting because in that period of history Marshall Tito was a
                    well-known world figure and he'd had a very interesting background. His wife had
                    also been a partisan during the war. It was interesting to see the way they
                    lived in the white palace where the king used to live, you know. They had island
                    resorts and so on, where they lived. And being communists. I thought communist
                    was everything for everybody, but it opened my eyes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever meet them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, we met them at big functions. My husband had an opportunity to go to
                    the island of Brioni when Tito was there. That was one of the summer places. He
                    had places almost everywhere. That was the occasion, I think, when the secretary
                    of commerce visited with a small delegation from Washington along with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you earlier about whether you got any kind
                        of training because you were assigned to a communist country for the first
                        time, namely, Yugoslavia. Did you get any preparation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I don't recall that there was any preparation. Perhaps my husband did,
                    officially. Usually the officers had an opportunity to have area study at the
                    Institute. I don't recall that I had any except for reading the post report. At
                    the post I took advantage of learning Serbo-Croatian at the embassy every
                    morning. I was allowed to do that. Because I had to learn it. In some ways I
                    needed it more than he did, because the people he dealt with in the foreign
                    office and so on were better educated and they spoke German or French. Len
                    studied Serbo-Croatian too, but he could also speak with them in other
                    languages. So I learned it to speak with the cook, to go to the market with her,
                    going downtown to do any errands. I had to have it. It helped a lot to read the
                    signs. Of course, when we traveled, everything was in Cyrillic.</p>

                <p>WEISS: I think that's a very good idea. I think the more you are prepared, the
                    better, in any way, politically or socially. I'm reminded that there was an
                    occasion when we went to Zagreb for the international trade fair, there was a
                    big banquet that night, hosted, I believe, by the mayor of the city and very
                    high officials, and I was included. Marshall Tito had come during the day. I
                    think we had opened our first trade pavilion and the secretary of commerce had
                    come to open that. Tito came for that, too. That evening, with this banquet,
                    Tito was not at the banquet. I think I was sitting next to the mayor or some
                    very high official. He was coming. Oh, you know, Tito, he's down there in town
                    and he's dancing and singing, and that will go on all night. That's the way we
                    are. At the table, as always at anything official, there were a lot of glasses
                    to drink.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Lots of toasts. On an occasion like this when Len was representing the
                    embassy and the trade fair in his daily work, there were toasts to him and
                    toasts to President Eisenhower and so on. Oh, I know. The host raised his glass
                    to President Eisenhowerand we all drank a toast, and then he sat down and made a
                    comment under his breath. He said, “You know, your President Eisenhower's in the
                    hospital.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that that made that comment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: The host of the banquet. And he said, “And our president, who's exactly
                    the same age as your president, is down in town dancing and drinking!” And I
                    felt like saying, “But he doesn't have some of the same responsibilities.” And
                    my husband doesn't drink, so he would have a hard time at these events because
                    they would say, “Come on! Come on! Fill up your glass!” Try to urge him to
                    drink.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Let me interrupt and just say one little comment about being in a
                    communist country. Yugoslavia was very unique because it was on the border
                    between the eastern communist bloc and right on the edge of western Europe, and
                    they looked in both directions. Politically, they were well known to be very
                    tied to Moscow as a communist country, but they were unique in that they had
                    their own. . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The eastern bloc or did that exist at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: The eastern bloc existed and they were part of it, but they were also more
                    free than any others because Tito insisted that they would have their — I've
                    forgotten what they call their unions — in the factories and so on. He stood up
                    for that right. So Yugoslavia was unique and different than the others. It
                    didn't simply follow the whole line. They also looked to the West and respected
                    the West and copied some of the Western things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to just ask you a little bit about the
                        representational functions iYugoslavia. That was your first post and I got
                        the impression that there were some difficulties regarding that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, there were, but all of these things are a challenge. I think most
                    people like a challenge, to face a challenge and see what they can do about it.
                    You learn as you go along.</p>
                <p>Representation in Yugoslavia was difficult for the reason I mentioned a moment
                    ago, that is the language problem. Another was if you invited eight people for
                    dinner and, let's say, two or three couples were Yugoslav, they would accept.
                    This is all done through the men's secretaries at the offices. So Len would come
                    home and tell me so many had accepted. Well, the night of the dinner — this
                    happened more than once — we'd go to the door to greet someone who was coming as
                    our guests and whenever it was a Yugoslav it would be only the husband and not
                    the wife. And I'd say, “Oh! I thought your wife would be coming” (because they'd
                    accepted as a couple). He'd say, “Oh, no, she's babysitting,” or something like
                    that. It happened so frequently that I was puzzled by it and discovered through
                    others that the Yugoslav wives, many of them. . . . The government was formed
                    mainly by men who had been partisans during the war. They were not well
                    educated. They had not traveled and gone out. They were not sophisticated. And
                    likewise with the wives. The wives didn't speak English or French often. And
                    another thing I was told was that they just didn't have the clothing to wear.
                    This wasn't that long after the war. Belgrade had been badly damaged, and they
                    just didn't have the resources. And I think they felt not only they didn't have
                    the clothes, but they didn't feel they had the manners. They felt they'd be very
                    uncomfortable coming into our home. It was sad, but that's the way it was.</p>
                <p>I remember every time we would be giving a party, whether it was a dinner or
                    luncheon or reception, we usually hired a local man to come and wait. Like a
                    butler. There were several and we'd always see them at other people's houses.
                    There were several of them. They understood English. They spoke French. My
                    favorite was a man who had been a butler to a foreign service officer. He'd
                    lived in Europe, so he was a little more sophisticated, and he set the table
                    beautifully. He loved to set the table.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>He'd go out in the garden and pick the flowers and do the flower arrangements. I
                    had to do the name cards. And the tricky part, on my part, was to seat next to
                    each other people who could converse with each other. Because if I knew that our
                    DCM, ElimO'Shaughnessy, spoke English, French, German, almost anything, I would
                    have to sit next to him, if there was a wife available, someone who could speak
                    with him and not just someone who didn't speak anything but Serbian. You had to
                    kind of match up interests and tastes as well if it was a very official dinner.
                    It might be people coming from Washington. Sometimes it was all male, stag. And
                    I'd usually have to arrange those, too.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed it and I learned a lot. I think there was a lot of it that was, maybe,
                    a little superfluous. It was the way it was done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they all seem to be formal or semi-formal,

                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, very much, except for receptions. I don't recall having as many
                    luncheons there as we used to in other posts. Mostly dinners and receptions,
                    cocktail parties. Our house was very small, but we had a large room that we
                    would empty out for cocktail parties if we had a large crowd. I don't think
                    there was any catering. We produced all the food, the cook, and she loved that.
                    And they're very proud, the servants who work for people like us. They're very
                    proud of what they do and they want to have a good reputation. So they put on
                    their best.</p>

                        associate entertaining with women, but people who would help you overseas,
                        butler and cook and so on, they're men. Does that strike you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, some cultures more so than others. In India all the house servants
                    were men. We didn't have an ayah because our children were too old for that. The
                    ones that did have them, they were usually women. They were always women. But
                    mostly male servants. But our cook and our maid there [in Belgrade] were women.
                    On the representation, this was a fairly formal post, although it was small. It
                    was European.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Belgrade. That's something that surprised me, being in a communist
                    country. But it was rather formal in the European style.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>When we went to Belgrade, as I said, we didn't have a house for a while. We were
                    in an apartment there. A hotel, then an apartment, and then a house. We had to
                    take all our furniture with us in those days, especially to that post, when one
                    was not going into a DCM's house or an ambassador's house. So we had to take our
                    furniture with us. Later on that changed. So we took our furniture with us. And
                    we didn't have the kind of furniture from our small house for entertaining the
                    way we were expected to. So we had to buy a lot of things that we needed once we
                    got there. And much of this was done through catalogues. And that was fun too,
                    in a way. And we traveled. When we went to Copenhagen we ordered silver from
                    George Jensen. And I think we ordered our dining room table from Sweden, and
                    that and some chairs came in a railroad car with a shipment that AID had made.
                    AID was furnishing all of its houses and apartments. Ours was not. But they
                    said, “We're ordering a trainload and there'll be some space. Do you want to
                    order some things? We can fit them in.” So we bought our dining room table and
                    chairs and some other things that we wanted. We had to get, as I said, the
                    crystal and the silver. Our dishes we ordered by catalogue from Rosenthal in
                    Germany. It was all kind of formal and the sort of thing that I wouldn't use
                    back here. So they're stored away. I use them on very special occasions like
                    weddings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been a very expensive proposition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: It was expensive, and I don't recall any allowance for it. There might
                    have been. I just don't recall. I'm just not sure about that. Of course, a lot
                    of it we're still using.</p>
                <p>I don't recall much entertaining that wasn't official. I don't recall much that
                    women did in the way of lunches. The women's club was started after the
                    inspectors said the morale was so low that the ambassador's wife was more or
                    less told she would have to do something about it. And so she got together a few
                    wives and we decided to start an American Women's Club. That worked quite well.
                    One of the first occasions was a luncheon at the home of the AID wife. She had a
                    very large villa and a beautiful big dining room. And she said, “Every Wednesday
                    there will be a luncheon here for women. Anybody.” Secretaries, staff, wives,
                    whoever. And that's the way it worked, and I remember some of the secretaries
                    did come because they were left out of everything else. They weren't usually
                    invited to formal dinners and so on. That was a starter.</p>

                    embassy. They had to be very carefully screened. There were little tours to
                    museums and so on. There wasn't really very much that we did in the
                    beginning.</p>

                    that, which included the AID mission, the military mission, and USIA. I think
                    that was about it. I may be missing out on a few things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Majority was State Department, though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: State. I think agriculture attach�, etc. We had a large AID mission for
                    those times, for those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they all together in the same mission, same
                        building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes. The building had been an apartment house previously, and it was
                    pockmarked by bullet holes from the war. Looked kind of depressing. But it
                    worked. Back on the property they had a little shack or a little room that was a
                    kind of club where you could go and have drinks or something. We had movies.
                    Where did we show the movies? I don't remember. Oh, I know. We showed movies in
                    our own homes. We were allowed to get movies through the military. The attach�s
                    office had a list of movies, and if you wanted one to use for entertaining,
                    you'd sign up for it. When the movie came in, you would go and get it for that
                    evening, and then someone else would have a turn. They'd be there for about a
                    week.</p>
                <p>Same thing with milk. We had a small commissary, and a milk truck delivered milk,
                    I think from Vienna or someplace in Austria, once a week. We all went to the
                    commissary, which also reminds me that at the first meeting of the women's club
                    group, I was sitting on a sofa with an attach�s wife on one side, a military
                    attach�, and on the other side, I think an AID wife. And I said, “You know each
                    other, don't you?” They'd been there quite a while longer. And they said, “We've
                    never been introduced. We never see each other at formal functions.” But one of
                    them said to the other, “I see you at the commissary every week, but I don't
                    know who you are.” So the women's club, you see, brought all these women
                    together.</p>
                <p>The AID group was very large, and they had some perks that others didn't, such as
                    the furnishings. But, on the other hand, they were not on the diplomatic list,
                    and they felt left out. Because they were not on the dip list, they were not
                    automatically on the invitation list. They really resented that. They were part
                    of the Wriston group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: There was some resentment there. But, on the other hand, they had some
                    things we didn't, and we had some things they didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you ended up kind of sharing with each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, and I __________ being on the board of the school _________. I joined
                    a little tennis club. It wasn't owned by the embassy. A very primitive
                    _________. All it had was a couple of tennis courts. If you did those things,
                    you'd meet there. We weren't bridge players. I think people who play bridge get
                    to meet others that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: But there wasn't a great deal to do. We used to, in the winter, take the
                    children to an outdoor skating rink downtown, in the city. They loved it. They
                    were young. We bought skates. This was all very new and exciting. I think it had
                    been some kind of stadium that was frozen over in the winter, and we went once
                    or twice. But then we found that local children, Yugoslav children, weren't
                    allowed to use it on, let's say, Sunday afternoon or whatever. They were
                    throwing snowballs at them and kind of pestering them. Again, it's the haves and
                    the have-nots.</p>
                <p>Another thing that used to happen to our children, we lived in a residential area
                    and had an iron fence around the house. We had a dog, a puppy dog, and the
                    Yugoslav children who walked to school by the fence would tease our dog. One of
                    them even threw an arrow toward the dog. They claimed the dog was [attacking
                    them]. But then Len would come home for lunch in the embassy car — he came home
                    in the car every day for lunch — and one time when the driver started the car,
                    there was a puncture in the front tire. One of these local children had put a
                    nail in the tire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how awful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Susan used to go down the street where there was an area called the
                    diplomatic colony. It's like a little residential area. Houses were set aside
                    for diplomats. She'd go down there on her scooter. I don't think she had a bike.
                    No, she had a bike. And one time when she was coming home — it was just a few
                    blocks away — she had fallen and she was crying, and some kid had pushed her
                    down, come by and pushed her for no reason. The streets were cobblestone, kind
                    of rough. And she was kind of bruised, bleeding all over. Not all over. But that
                    upset her, and again, you explain to your child. She went, “Why did they do this
                    to me?” I said, “You had a bike and he didn't. You're the stranger. You're
                    living in a house that maybe his father would like to live in.” That sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like this could be one aspect of communist
                        country living. No?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WEISS: Well, some of these children might have been military. There was a
                    military establishment of some kind down the street. Whether it was a school or
                    training place I'm not sure, but a lot of Yugoslav military families lived
                    there. We and a few other American embassy people were living on the street they
                    were on. And I don't know whether it was military kids or not. I'm not saying it
                    was. ___________ to the foreigners, the strangers in that community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That made me think of the question of, after the first
                        post, did you and your husband stop to kind of reflect on the decision that
                        you had made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I don't remember that we stopped, literally, and did that. I think we just
                    felt we were in and just went along with it. We came back here for three years,
                    posted here, and so our children went back into the same schools. We came back
                    into our house. We wanted to keep the house. Some of our friends had sold their
                    houses. I was glad we hung on to ours because we had something to come back to.
                    The children could remember their rooms. They'd say, “Oh, I'm going to hang this
                    up on the walls of the room.” People who had sold their houses didn't have that
                    for their children. Our daughter went into Scouts and went back to the same
                    school.</p>
                <p>But they found that coming back — this is a different subject, to— when they come
                    back, same neighborhood, same school, but the kids treat them differently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Because they haven't had the continuity, and these kids, maybe, now are
                    doing things or singing songs that our kids aren't familiar with. So it takes
                    quite a while to catch up with them. On the other hand, the children here have
                    nothing to relate to our experience abroad. They don't know what to ask you
                    about. They don't stop to ask, “What was it like living in Belgrade?” They just
                    know that you've been away for three years, and you don't know what we're
                    doing.</p>
                <p>Continuation of Interview - August 13, 1992 at Mary Louise's home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Louise, we were talking about the Wriston program and
                        also your life in a communist country, namely, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, as your
                        first post; and we have talked about some of the aspects of representation
                        in that country. At this point, it struck me that you seemed to have a
                        pretty smooth transition from civil service into foreign service. Do you
                        feel that's the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Do you think that when we returned, did we feel. . . . ?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The aspect of just moving after 10 years of civil service
                        into foreign service. You had a lot of anxiety, obviously. But it seems like
                        from what we have just talked about earlier you had a fairly smooth first
                        post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I think so. I think it went smoothly. There were a lot of bumps in there,
                    but there are everywhere, all the time, anyway. And I think we found. . . . The
                    challenge is always good for everybody. I think we met it. The children seemed
                    to have enjoyed their experience and were eager to come back home and renew this
                    experience. That was a little hard at first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Wriston program created, in effect, created an
                        opportunity for you that you found valuable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, definitely, and I think we all, inside of each other, realized the
                    advantages, the excitement, and interest, the advantages of being able to travel
                    around Europe together as a family. Things like that, I think, made up for some
                    of the rough spots and the disadvantages. Coming back home was a little hard for
                    the children adjusting back into the community and school where they were looked
                    on as different. But I think this is where the Association of American Foreign
                    Service Women did so much for me. That is a binding group of women who all share
                    similar experiences. They're not all exactly alike, of course. I have always
                    been a member, and it's a place where you can meet people who have had similar
                    experiences and you feel comfortable with them. I feel comfortable with you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I look on it as a big family and we all share something that's very deep
                    and exciting and different and challenging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the opposite side of that, did you get any impression
                        from the foreign service people who then came back through the Wriston
                        program to serve in Washington, DC? Did you get any impressions about how
                        they felt about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: About coming back?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WEISS: No, it was just another thing you accepted. Coming back for the first time
                    was new and different. It was sort of like going to a post, but it was a
                    familiar post and you fit back in. There are a lot of adjustments to make.</p>
                <p>I guess I was thinking of the group who were particularly affected by the Wriston
                    program, because at the beginning we mentioned the fact that the Wristonees were
                    civil service being offered this opportunity to go overseas in the foreign
                    service, whilesome of the foreign service officers can then come into
                    Washington, DC, to take their posts. And I was wondering if there was any. . .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking more of the foreign service people when
                        they come back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To take up these positions that used to be civil
                        service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I can't speak for them. I think they, too, knew they had to accept it. It
                    was a change. It was a social change as well as other. I always would see those
                    ladies at the women's association gatherings, and they didn't seem any different
                    to me except that maybe they were more experienced in the foreign service. And
                    so I looked on that as a great advantage that I could talk to them about or
                    listen. I felt I was one of them, in a sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I didn't feel equal to them, but I felt, again, one big happy family. One
                    big family. Very rich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, Mary Louise, I understand that you were pretty much a
                        pioneer in the mental health program in the State Department. Could you tell
                        me a little bit more about how that got started and how you got
                        involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WEISS: Yes. I'm not sure that I can think of myself as a pioneer, but I was here
                    at the time when things were developing and it was rather exciting in a way.
                    President Nixon at the White House declared that every government agency was to
                    establish a program to prevent drug abuse. Drug abuse prevention was the name of
                    this program. There was quite a bit of money available for that and so every
                    agency. . . . The secretary of state received a letter saying that he wanted to
                    start a program, and the medical office brought in a psychiatrist, a man from
                    the outside, from Wisconsin, Dr. Frank Johnson, who was an adolescent
                    psychiatrist. He knew nothing. He'd never lived abroad. He knew nothing about
                    foreign service except what he'd heard about it. He was a man of action. He
                    started a mental health advisory committee, of which I was a member. I think
                    there was an appeal through the department — yes, I remember now — through the
                    department for anyone who was interested in this to come to monthly meetings. I
                    was on the board of the AAFSW, and I think I was on the education committee at
                    the time, and I was asked by our AAFSW president if I would be interested in
                    serving on this committee as a representative of the foreign service women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this would have been 19. . . .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: About 1971. I was delighted. I wonder how she had asked me, but I thought
                    she picked the right one because I was very interested. My role was to represent
                    the women on this committee. It met monthly in the State Department. It was
                    hosted pretty much by the medical bureau, and Dr. Johnson chaired it. There were
                    representatives at those meetings of other bureaus in the State Department. I
                    think there were some occasions when other agencies came into the meetings. The
                    Army, other groups like that. I think the Army had already started something of
                    its own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean, like other foreign affairs agencies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes. And, of course, within the State Department it included USIA (United
                    States Information Agency), AID, and so on, and the overseas schools office, FSI
                    (Foreign Service Institute). I represented the women. I think AFSA (American
                    Foreign Service Association). Eventually, the FLO (Family Liaison Office) office
                    was represented. I think FLO had just opened.</p>
                <p>The idea was to share ideas on how we could, what kind of programs and how to
                    implement them. There were sessions when we were talking ideas around and to
                    think about budgets and that sort of thing. The ideas were what excited me. I
                    found in my files pages and pages of ideas I would send to Dr. Johnson about
                    things I thought might be helpful. Others did the same.</p>
                <p>The whole thrust was awareness. Make everybody, employees, families and so on,
                    aware of the problem of drug abuse and how we could resolve it, how we could
                    prevent it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there some specific incidents that raised this
                        awareness? Were there some specific [issues]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I suppose there were through the drug administration, national drug
                    administration. I wasn't too aware of those details myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not something specific that happened in the State
                        Department with the foreign service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Not that I know of. There may have been, but not that I know of. There
                    were records, of course, of drug problems and alcohol problems, that sort of
                    thing. Because the thrust was awareness, it was a matter of educating people,
                    talking about it, getting the word around, involving as many people as possible
                    of all ages. One of the things I admired about Dr. Johnson was he said, “If it's
                    a drug abuse problem amongst the teenagers, then they must be involved. We want
                    them with us.” So they were encouraged to come into their own. . . . I think
                    they had their own meetings. They sent out flyers to the personnel in the
                    department. Any teenage dependents get together in the summer when they were out
                    of school and talk about their [concerns]. What were they aware of that was
                    going on at the post or here that were hurting their friends or in their
                    families? Eventually, a youth development team was developed. I never liked that
                    title, but I think the kids gave themselves that name.</p>
                <p>The youth development team was focused on the teenagers. Because I was
                    representing the women, I felt that I had to focus on more than just problems
                    with children, but were there problems in families. Was it alcohol? What would
                    drive people to take drugs, or drive them to become alcoholic? There must be a
                    problem that makes them do that. What are those problems? They have the
                    problems. Because we had these meetings monthly and were sharing all of this,
                    things would come out. The wives would say, :Well, we need more training. The
                    men can get language training at FSI and we can't. If we are entitled to any
                    orientation, we can't come because we have little children at home and we can't
                    afford to get a babysitter.” So we had to work out those kinds of things. There
                    was more training available, and allowances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that kind of got also out from the mental health
                        awareness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: All of these things were, I think, involved with the mental health. It
                    wasn't just drug abuse prevention. It was mental health. It was morale. All of
                    these things together. They're all tied together. If there's a problem in a
                    family because a child is dyslexic, then they can't take the child to a post
                    because the child can't be educated. And what do we do about that family,
                    because there were more than one child with that problem? Someone mentioned
                    that. Then you get the department aware and you get more allowances to take care
                    of special problems like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The foreign-born spouses, I think, had a morale problem. They felt a little
                    isolated in some ways. There might be a language problem, and all of that. So
                    they stood back a bit. That was one of the things I focused on later and
                    eventually they established their own foreign-born spouse association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Network.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Network. Ideas such as newsletters, magazines at the post, are a great
                    help as a place where articles can be written about problems like this. An
                    outlet for people to get together and express themselves. The teenagers. At the
                    school in India, the international school, I believe the American Women's Club
                    sponsored a writing contest to allow the teenagers, the students, to become more
                    involved in the community, being able to express themselves. Writing poetry and
                    essays and other things. They weren't just writing about travel and about their
                    experiences. They were writing about all kinds of things that were happening to
                    them. All this is mental health. Vague, in some ways, but if people can express
                    themselves and feel it's all right to talk about a drug problem or a friend who
                    has a drug problem, then you're going down the right track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of writing about mental health, you are a writer
                        and you have produced a number of articles about mental health, and that
                        obviously had a lot of impact on the community in general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Possibly. I wrote an article after our experience in India when our
                    daughter came back to college alone and we were still out there. She was young.
                    She was 16. She'd gone through school there in three years rather than four. I
                    felt she was a bit young to be coming back alone and going into college. I wish
                    she could have stayed another year, but my husband wanted her to keep her
                    educational continuity. But nevertheless, she came back and it was a very
                    difficult year. I wrote an article. I was asked, I believe, to write an article
                    — also I had written a letter — about her transition and the problems she had
                    coming back from India while the family was still out there, because she was
                    traveling alone for the first time across the world. We told her how to go
                    through an airport and handle her own luggage, her own checking account, all of
                    that. I don't think we'd really thought that much about it beforehand. She'd
                    traveled with us and she knew what to do on her own. She did come back with a
                    girlfriend and stopped in Europe as many of the children did who left school out
                    there. But it was very traumatic in many ways, her transition. So I wrote about
                    what families could do in advance to help pave the way, make children a little
                    more aware. You know, you're going to have to be careful of this and that when
                    you're traveling; and when you get to school alone, what to expect. It may be a
                    while before your luggage comes, or whatever. How much is considered an adequate
                    amount in college. In New York City.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEISS: So that was an article I wrote. And then I wrote some. . . . I did a lot
                    of reporting of this mental health committee, of columns in the AAFSW
                    newsletter, about the development of these programs. Also we had articles in the
                    AID news. I've forgotten what they call their newspaper. And USIA and the
                    Foreign Service Journal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you can tell some of those major events in the
                        development of the mental program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I mentioned the youth development team. There was a team — I think it was
                    in 1972 or three — that consisted of about four teenagers, foreign service
                    teenagers. They went with Dr. Johnson and, I believe, a medical administrative
                    officer, to the Far East where most of the problems were, problems with drug
                    abuse, especially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Far East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes. They went to Vientiane, Bangkok. The youth, the young people in that
                    group, felt their role was to work with the students in the schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the international schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: In these schools, whatever post they were visiting. In Bangkok I think
                    there was more than one school where Americans went. So they'd fan out into the
                    schools and talk to the students in assemblies and in classes and in other ways.
                    I think they met for bull sessions in the evenings and social occasions, trying
                    to talk about all of this. “What are the problems here? What do you think we
                    should do about it? What can you do about it? What are you willing to do to help
                    here at the post?” Then getting the youth and the adults together.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>They came back and wrote a report. Meanwhile, those of us back here were still
                    carrying on with these meetings. The following year Dr. Johnson asked me if I
                    would go with them, with the youth development team, also to the Far East,
                    again, to be another adult along with him. And there were two young people, a
                    young man and a young woman who was not foreign service; but the young man was.
                    That was the way they were recruited. Anyone could come who was interested and
                    had certain qualifications. But, again, my role was to deal with whatever
                    women's issues were a problem at the post. So I talked with every personnel
                    director. They all happened to be women, single women, in every post, and asked
                    those people, the personnel people in the embassies, about the possibilities for
                    employment of wives who had adequate training or could take jobs. In many posts
                    there were problems with work permits. Some governments just won't allow. That
                    may have changed now. I also talked with as many wives as I could. I addressed
                    the women's groups.</p>
                <p>In Bangkok we had a big regional conference, so all the people interested from
                    the whole region, from Djakarta, Manila, Vientiane, New Delhi, came to Bangkok
                    where we had a regional medical officer. We had a big conference. There were
                    representatives of the schools, community leaders who might be church
                    representatives, student leaders, women's leaders, and that sort of thing.
                    Anyone dealing with American children and families. I met a woman who was a
                    school counselor in Vientiane. She told me — I think in our hotel room one
                    evening; it was only an aside, but it really opened my eyes — she said that in
                    Vientiane they had a small American school, international school. Many of the
                    children whom she was counseling were college entrance. They were all American
                    high school and soon they were going to go on to college. She was the counselor.
                    And many of these young American students had mothers who were Vietnamese or
                    Laotians, Thai. They were Asian mothers, who had married American, either
                    embassy personnel or some of them had married flyers. I think we had a secret
                    airline, you know, doing all kinds of things. And these women, many of them,
                    couldn't speak English, and so in the home they were speaking their own
                    language. This was hard for the children to understand quite who they were. They
                    thought they had problems. Some of those mothers, I learned from this woman,
                    were using drugs as people in that part of world do socially. It's more of a
                    cultural thing. But it was a problem for the kids. Drugs are so available, were
                    so available, and so cheap. A lot of the kids were taking drugs. They didn't
                    know what they were doing. Ninety percent pure heroin. Maybe they tried
                    marijuana at home. They'd go out there and they'd get heroin.</p>
                <p>So she was having problems with these high school students, who, some of them,
                    had never been to America. They were born overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And mixed parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WEISS: And mixed. So she came up with the brilliant idea of rather than having
                    the students say, “Oh, I want to go to this university or that one, or that
                    college,” she suggested that this small group, maybe six of them, all apply to
                    the same small college so they could be together. I thought that was very smart,
                    because they would at least have each other in their first year. Whether they
                    went on and did other things or not, I don'know, or spread out. That was one way
                    she dealt with it, but it made me aware that it isn't just fathers who have
                    several drinks at night, who may be alcoholics, but many of the mothers and
                    wives also had some of these problems.</p>
                <p>So, representing women, I thought, this is something I had to bring to the
                    attention of Dr. Johnson. And I said, the foreign-born spouses — I knew there
                    were a lot of them here and always have been many, a high percentage in the
                    foreign service. . . . Not that they have a problem, but for their own morale,
                    their mental health, or whatever, give them some identity. So they eventually
                    founded their own association and they had a newsletter. I can't find one. I've
                    got one somewhere here I'll give you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're going to revive that, I understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, I just started, and we will have our first meeting on August 25th. So
                    I sent out some letters and sheets to indicate topics and to get some sense of
                    what people would like to address during meetings, and I spoke to almos20 of
                    them who had been involved in previous groups.</p>
                <p>So if people can meet with others who they feel comfortable with, they can talk
                    about things that bother them, or even things that may not be serious problems,
                    maybe just the language difficulty. But if they can meet with others and have a
                    good time, it helps their mental health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is all part of the agenda of the mental health
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, and the drug abuse prevention was maybe a core. When we visited
                    embassies, Dr. Johnson addressed the ambassador's. . . . What do you call it?
                    The ambassador has a meeting of all the staff. The country team. I remember in
                    India he did that and made them aware that alcohol abuse is a drug abuse. Think
                    of it as a drug. People take advantage of the marine barracks nearby, the marine
                    house where every Friday evening people go from work. They have their drink and
                    then go home. Well, that was a social occasion. But some people, it got to be a
                    problem. Some people are more prone to alcohol as a problem rather than just
                    social.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that a problem, too, during the representational
                        functions sometimes? Alcohol?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>WEISS: Well, that's been mentioned, that there's too much of it. It's too much
                    available. You get liquor through the embassy commissary. You get it cheaper
                    than you would otherwise. But you have to use it for entertaining, or you think
                    you have to except in Muslim countries where they don't drink. But if you don't
                    serve it, they expect it. We always downplayed that because we're not drinkers,
                    but we did offer it along with juice and other things. It has been talked of as
                    something that is so available that it can lead to abuse because it's there and
                    it's easy and it's cheaper. People may take to drink for more than just social
                    reasons because they're away from home and they feel disoriented or separated
                    from children or whatever it is, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any emphasis on all the types of mental health
                        problems, drug-related?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, definitely. It covered the waterfront, as we say. It covered anything
                    people looked at as a problem, as stress, whether it was not having your child
                    with you, a child away from home at school, or a medical problem where you have
                    to be evacuated. That happened to me in Yugoslavia. I had to be evacuated out
                    medically. And then the children learn about it. It affects the children. In
                    some isolated or underdeveloped posts where there aren't fine hospitals or
                    facilities you have to be evacuated out. It may just be nearby, Calcutta or
                    Bangkok or further. It may be back home. Medical problems, physical problems,
                    can be a mental problem. They affect the whole family. And financial problems
                    come into it too if you're worried about that.</p>
                <p>The wives were organized, or organizing, as in the case of the foreign-born
                    wives. The youth organized their own association. I want here to give credit to
                    Lee Dane. She's a Ph.D. in psychology now, and she was on that original mental
                    health committee. She'd come back from Madras, where she'd done some work, and
                    she had teenagers, and as the ideas developed, she suggested a weekend retreat
                    at her home out in Great Falls, Virginia, which is along the Potomac. I don't
                    know how many there were, but quite a number of high-school-age foreign service
                    teenagers went out. I think Dr. Johnson was there also. They had their canoeing
                    and their picnics and so on, but they had talk sessions where they just talked
                    about the foreign service life. There were several of those retreats later and I
                    think maybe they still have some. Eventually they had their own newsletter. And
                    they called themselves “Around the world in a lifetime.”</p>

                <p>WEISS: They've changed the name now. I'm pretty sure that recently there is a

                    projects.</p>

                        sounds like there were parallel programs and attention paid to the dependent
                        teenagers, children, and so on, as well as the adults, the employees and the
                        spouses. Mary Louise, do you feel that there are any differences between
                        problems that children face and adults face in the foreign service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: You mean little children as against older children? Or children in
                    general?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Children who are of different ages, as opposed to the
                        adult group, adult and non-adults, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, definitely. At post, especially. At home they can do things with
                    neighbors and the Scouts and so on. In some posts there were more facilities
                    than in others for the children when they're out of school. There are problems
                    which include children; some that don't. I remember in New Delhi in part of the
                    embassy complex there is a swimming pool and a snack bar. There was a hired —
                    well, maybe more than one — a local lifeguard for the pool. And when I heard
                    that teenagers, either there already in the high school or college-age student
                    dependents coming to visit their family in the summer, wanted to be employed,
                    wanted summer jobs, and there were no summer jobs available. What could they do?
                    Couldn't they work at the snack bar? Couldn't they be lifeguards? I helped to
                    look into that because our son was interested although he was a little bit young
                    for that, but he was interested. There was some regulation that a local employee
                    was a lifeguard. They were frustrated because they wanted not only to have
                    something useful to be doing. My point was that they needed work experience, and
                    I wrote about that, too, that we should find employment overseas for our older
                    students. They get work experience that they need, even if it's volunteer work.
                    Because when they come home and they're in college or high school, they want a
                    summer job like every other teenager. And if they don't have any experience,
                    they have to start from the bottom. And if they have some experience, that's a
                    little help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, good point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Employment for students abroad was one thing. Employment for wives is
                    quite another, wives who were social workers or lawyers or artists or whatever.
                    That's something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they do face different sorts of problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WEISS: They do, and the students know that they're going eventually to be leaving
                    their parents and going back to school and will be on their own. And I think
                    they deserve to have what they feel they need. The smaller children, I think,
                    don't have quite these same needs when they're quite young. Parents take them to
                    play with their friends, and they can go to the pool or have a little pool. They
                    play in the park nearby after school. Whatever, it's much easier with the young
                    ones.</p>
                <p>Some of the problems come with ayahs, or nursemaids, especially in some cultures
                    where there's a different way of bringing up little children. They're either too
                    overbearing or too hovering over them. Preventing them from walking when they
                    might want to start. Things like that.</p>
                <p>Dr. Sidney Werkman is a psychiatrist who wrote a book about raising children
                    overseas. There have been a few books written. But he came to some of these
                    meetings from the University of Colorado, and became so interested. I think he
                    had had a practice here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the meetings that you were running.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: The mental health advisory meetings. He became so interested in the
                    special problems of raising families overseas that he wrote a book. But before
                    he wrote the book, he came to Washington and interviewed any foreign service
                    families, individuals, mothers or children or whoever, who were interested in
                    giving him some input. I went to some of those, and I think there was an open
                    meeting, too, or individual meetings with him where you could just spill out
                    whatever you wanted to. I can't say that that came as a result of this awareness
                    program aimed at drug abuse, but it started as a whole mental health development
                    in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>Another thing, speaking of psychiatrists, is that Dr. Johnson was plugging for
                    the foreign service to have a psychiatrist at each and every regional
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to ask you that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: There were, eventually, in — I've forgotten how many regions there are. .
                    . . At the same time I was noticing that many of the foreign service women who
                    were coming back from overseas — as I was talking to them at a meeting — and
                    they were expressing some interest in health generally. . . . I said, “Well,
                    come to one of these meetings.” I discovered that several of them were coming
                    back and getting degrees in social work. More than one. It was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: In the early '70s. And they eventually, again through sharing all these
                    ideas, decided to organize themselves; and they set up a foreign service social
                    worker group. Dr. Johnson also suggested to the department that not only
                    psychiatrists at post would be necessary, but to have a social worker, because
                    you could employ a wife at the post who was a social worker to work with the
                    doctor, embassy doctor. I think that had a meager beginning. I don't know that
                    it every got anywhere.</p>
                <p>Another result of all this was the formation in the State Department, on the same
                    floor where the medical office is, State Department Employee Services. That
                    consists of social workers.</p>
                <p>Another thing that developed was the Foreign Service Educational and Counseling
                    Center. Clark Slade for 15 or so years had been a counselor on education, mostly
                    selecting schools. He had an office across the street in the AFSA building.
                    Anyone who wanted advice on where to place a boarding student, he was there to
                    help. But he did more than school counseling, and he felt it should be more than
                    just an educational center. It should be also counseling for mental health. So
                    he started it. He asked me to help design this. And this is the Educational and
                    Counseling Center. Eventually, he himself was brought into the medical office,
                    employed there; and this changed when the FLO developed and took over some of
                    these things, these same counseling services. They had an education person in
                    FLO. So it kind of split away. But at its time it served a purpose and I was on
                    the board of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought _______ essentially a counseling service at FSI
                        currently.</hi>

                <p>WEISS: ____________. Not just for employment?</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it's a separate office in, I believe it's in FSI,
                        probably because of the fact that it's so available to people who are there
                        usually when they are back home for training and so on. I remember seeing
                        some pamphlets about that. I can't tell you the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WEISS: I'd be interested to know more about it. That was another thing.
                    Psychiatric treatment was more available in the department — at post, too — but
                    in the department. They enlarged the staff in the med.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there some special program also for children with
                        psychiatric problems? I was under the impression they did something specific
                        to children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were involved, then. I thought that they would
                        evaluate children for school, maybe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, that may have been there. Another thing that happened. Before some
                    of these things developed there was a questionnaire that was sent out to posts
                    and to every foreign service family here, a questionnaire asking what specific
                    issues anybody, an y foreign person would like to have dealt with, that didn't
                    have a resource. The children had an input in that. They were asked to submit
                    any questions they would like answered, and the older students and families. I
                    think all the children who were her e were interviewed for their ideas, who were
                    not necessarily involved in the program.</p>
                <p>Awareness went out. It came back. And then it went out again in the form of ideas
                    and programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then programs, specific programs, such as the
                        psychiatrist, regional psychiatrist and the social workers and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Meanwhile, over at FSI there was more training for women. The briefing
                    center started the FLO office, opened the FLO office. It's been a marvelous
                    resource for families. That really developed and has enlarged tremendously.</p>
                <p>Continuation of Interview - August 21st, 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Mary Louise, when you were talking about mental
                        health at the end of our interview. . . . I'd like to ask you if there is
                        anything you'd like to add regarding the mental health program, or anybody
                        you're like to mention.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WEISS: I was thinking that it would be important to mention that during that
                    period, the early period of the programs in the State Department, when Dr.
                    Johnson was heading the mental health advisory committee in the State
                    Department, the mental health committee, anyone who was interested was welcome
                    to come into it. As it built up awareness and interest, the department was
                    offering, well, I suppose you could call them scholarships for training at the
                    National Institute of Drug Abuse. I went with some of the young people, some of
                    the teenagers, to a training course here in what was in Rosslyn. I can't
                    remember how long it was, but it was several days; and that was very exciting
                    and interesting working with the young people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So these are scholarships for teenagers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, for me, too. It was covering the costs of the training. Other people
                    who were in those courses were people who were working in communities and
                    cities. We happened to be foreign service, but we, along with others, were
                    getting the same kind oftraining in how, once you leave this workshop, to go out
                    into your community — our community would be the State Department and foreign
                    service posts — and set up programs to alleviate the problems and build up
                    awareness. And that, I found very stimulating and rewarding and educational.</p>
                <p>There was another brief one. These are all overnight stays. Another one I
                    attended was here in Washington. My roommate was Marina _____. I hadn't met her
                    before, but she was a very good woman who went out into her community here and
                    did things with the schools. Clark Slade came up with the suggestion during this
                    period for a training course for foreign service women, wives, mothers, who
                    would be interested in kind of non-professiona— I'm not sure of the word I want
                    — social worker training. He was, besides being the educational counselor for
                    the State Department foreign service, also worked out at the Episcopal school
                    for children in Northwest Washington, DC. Another wife, who was on this
                    committee, Connie Hill, and I did take that course. I think it was, maybe, six
                    or nine months long, under his supervision. We were actually assigned to cases.
                    The other woman, Connie, had done all of her social work training years and
                    years ago, and she left college and then went into her master's. I had not had
                    that, so there was a long gap in her training and I had had none; but I had this
                    interest. Clark Slade's idea was that by taking a training course under his
                    supervision, we would come out with some kind of a certificate, or at least an
                    experience, a work experience, that would help if we wanted to go on with it.
                    And I thought that was a very good idea.</p>
                <p>And I did mention the foreign service women's social workers who organized with
                    the idea that when they went to posts they could use their professional training
                    at the post, or here in Washington. That was quite successful. I'm not sure if
                    it's still in existence. I hope it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were quite a number of people who were involved
                        with the mental health program at various stages.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WEISS: I would say there was just the right number. It wasn't an immense group.
                    It was a group big enough to handle. As with any organization or volunteer kind
                    of thing, only those who were truly, deeply interested would come into it, and
                    dedicate themselves as long as they're interested. That's the way it was. These
                    were years that we were between posts, and I felt I was mature enough that I
                    knew what I wanted to do or develop, not having had a career in all of our
                    foreign service life. And I was here and my children were grown and I had the
                    time and I was deeply interested in it. There were other women like myself or
                    others who came back who were on this committee or got into this work, who, at
                    the same time or later on, went on to get degrees of one kind or another in this
                    kind of career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great! So this was a lot of personal growth, as well as
                        contribution to the community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, definitely! Definitely so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. Mary Louise, you also mentioned things about
                        international schools, the different situations at different posts. Maybe
                        you can address that a little bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, I think every post has a different school situation. Our first one
                    was in Belgrade. Our daughter was then eight and had gone into third grade. Our
                    son attended a nursery school during that period. The small international school
                    there, to me, was a mini UN. It was almost ideal. It was just the right size. It
                    was housed in a former villa that had belonged to, was used by the AID director.
                    It was a pleasant situation and a home atmosphere, but it was a school. And it
                    was truly international. All the diplomatic children whose parents were there
                    and wanted their children at the post attended. Asia, Africa, Britain, and
                    France. Many of the children didn't know English, couldn't understand English,
                    so there was coaching, tutoring, I believe, either before school in the morning
                    or after. They had to attend classes that were taught in English. This was what
                    they couldn't understand at first. So they would get the coaching afterwards,
                    and the children kept up very quickly.</p>
                <p>In the fall when there is United Nations Day, we celebrated, and the children
                    were asked to wear their national costumes in a little parade. Our daughter came
                    home and said, “What is our national costume?” I didn't know what to say! I
                    don't recall what she wore. I went over and took pictures, as many of the
                    parents did. The son of the Ethiopian ambassador was there with a shield and a
                    monkey-fur cape, which was very, very dramatic. The little British boy, I think,
                    was wearing kilts. And so on. A Burmese girl, who was a friend of my daughter's,
                    wore a Burmese outfit. That was not unexciting to me. I'm sure it was to the
                    children. They were encouraged to think internationally. I believe during that
                    UN week the children were asked to bring to school things from their own
                    countries, dolls or toys or books that they could display so that everyone could
                    share within the school community. Our daughter thought this was wonderful.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I remember two little boys in her class were from Uruguay. One of them was
                    dressed as a cowboy. I think the other was a pirate, which puzzled me, but this
                    was their idea. They had to dress in a costume. Whether their parents didn't
                    have one for them and they just thought, “Well, let's wear something that's a
                    costume.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came up with something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, and that was the whole idea, to get the children into thinking about
                    the others and of themselves as one big family. That was a wonderful experience
                    for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that always easy, though? Do you always find good
                        international schools in all the posts you served?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I don't think so. We had fewer posts than many people. And, of course, it
                    varies. That was a communist country, and that was an international school that
                    was run by — as any private school here would be — by the parents of the
                    children. There was a school board. I was on the school board. The principal was
                    an American woman, who had been widowed and had lost her, not only her husband
                    and her child in an automobile accident. And I remember Susan came home. She
                    also taught third grade. Susan came home that first week and said that Miss
                    Williams told us that she had lost her only child in an automobile accident, but
                    she was so happy that she now had this family of however many children there
                    were in the third grade. So she felt motherly toward all those children. It was
                    reflected back by them. They looked on her differently than just a teacher. It
                    was a marvelous situation.</p>
                <p>I think it depends on the leadership. A lot of these things do, and this woman
                    was good. The community was kind of isolated because we were in a communist
                    country, and not everyone wanted to send their children abroad to school,
                    especially at the younger ages. So we just put every effort into making this
                    school a good one, and it was very good.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I think what they lacked in that school that they might have gotten here they
                    made up for in other ways. And that's true of all the schools abroad. When Susan
                    came back here to enter [high school], I believe it was, she had not had much
                    American history, particularly of Virginia, which was required in the Virginia
                    schools. So she realized that was something she hadn't had abroad and it didn't
                    matter that much abroad; but she got it here, and took a special interest in it.
                    There are courses in many schools that they don't get abroad, but they get other
                    things at other kinds of schools and they make up for it. When we lived in Bonn,
                    our daughter, Susan, was in college and David was going to Bonn with us to enter
                    the ninth grade for a half year. He only had half of the year here and we went
                    out in December, and he had had, in the ninth grade here in Arlington, what they
                    were going to be teaching in the second semester in Bonn, which was a defense
                    department school. So the school was confused about that. They had David sitting
                    in the hall in a chair while the class was learning things he had already
                    learned for that next semester. I'm sure that hurt him. I'm sure in other ways
                    it might have strengthened him, but it was kind of sad in a way. But you learn
                    by these things.</p>
                <p>Here, he had just begun to learn driving. Did I mention this in the
                    interview?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: So that was another little aspect. The school in India was a truly
                    international school. Indians, as well as all other nationalities who were
                    represented in India, were eligible to attend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were not just diplomat's, children of
                        diplomats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: No, not at all. Business. And in India there were in India. You know, in
                    Yugoslavia, Yugoslav children were never at the school, and there would have
                    been a language problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it run differently in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WEISS: In India? Well, this was a higher level school. At least, our children
                    were at mid- and high school levels. So I saw it from a different level. It was
                    run by the board. Again, I was on the school board. Later, eventually, I believe
                    it was after we left, and for some political reason — I think our countries were
                    having some problems — it became the American Embassy School. I believe, but I'm
                    not sure of this, that Indians and possibly some other nationalities were not
                    allowed to attend. I'm not sure, or whether it was that the tuition was
                    different. I shouldn't go into that because I don't know. But it became the
                    American Embassy School, whereas before, it was the American International
                    School; and the teachers were from the U.S. and Britain and other places. It was
                    as international as they could make it. Of course, some countries can't provide
                    teachers, or teachers can't apply from some places. They don't qualify or
                    whatever, but it was as international as they could make it. And the experiences
                    were marvelous.</p>
                <p>But when we arrived in New Delhi, the opening day of school was to be an event
                    out on the lawn under what they call a 'shamiana,' like a tent; and parents were
                    invited to come if they wanted to. I did, and I'm so happy I did. Indira Gandhi
                    was then the daughter of Prime Minister Nehru. She also, I believe, held a post;
                    she was minister for education. So she was particularly interested. And she was
                    asked to speak. It was a small gathering of students and parents. The principal,
                    maybe the student leader, presented her with a marigold wreath around her neck,
                    which is typical. Then she spoke to the children, and she said, “I was once one
                    of you. I went to school in Switzerland when I was” (whatever age she was). She
                    said, “I remember being far away from home, far from my parents. I wrote letters
                    to them. They wrote letters to me. And I knew what it was like to be away from
                    home, away from my family in a strange country.” And so she immediately related
                    to them and they to her. They were sitting on the edge of their seats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old was she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: She was a mother. In fact, her two sons went to school, went to the
                    international school. Our daughter went to parties where her sons were, and they
                    did things together with a group.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Another wonderful thing about that school that impressed me, the kind of
                    atmosphere in a school like that, in a community where you're far from home in a
                    different culture, Susan was entering tenth grade, ninth. She went through in
                    three years. The first day she arrived she was invited by a senior in the high
                    school, years older than she was, to come to a party that he was giving. She was
                    so thrilled! She came home and told me about it. Back home, here, you more or
                    less socialized with your peer group and your class and your homeroom and your
                    neighborhood. He was a senior. He was older and very handsome. The school was
                    like that. The whole hundred students, or hundred Americans, or whatever the
                    numbers were, thought of themselves as a unit, not as this class and that class,
                    eighth grade, tenth grade, seniors. They, at least this is the impression I had,
                    it was more or less for all Americans. We're all here and we're all neighbors.
                    Our parents work in the embassy, the same embassy. Our parents know each other,
                    which isn't always the case here. So there were these marvelous
                    opportunities.</p>
                <p>I remember when we came back, talking to Clark Slade about what I think of as the
                    circles of our community life in a place like New Delhi, which is a very, was,
                    at that time, a very large post. All of the American children, more or less,
                    went to the same school. Some went to boarding schools up in the mountains. All
                    the parents, husbands, were employed at the American embassy. We all used the
                    same doctor at the embassy, and the nurse. We all did our shopping at the
                    American embassy commissary. There was a community church where most of us went,
                    attended. There was a Catholic and so on, but more or less. And we all went to
                    the movies together. So we had more than one circle. We all did and lived in the
                    same area, did the same things together.</p>
                <p>You come home and your neighborhood is one of your circles. Or you have friends
                    and neighbors. Your parents work in different places. My husband was at the
                    State Department. My neighbor's husband worked in the Defense Department, and so
                    on. They weren't the same. More or less, the children went to the same schools,
                    but we'd do our shopping in different places. We went to different doctors. We
                    went to different churches. But when you live abroad in a post, and especially
                    in a small post, it's a small circle of activities and socializing, pretty
                    generally — of course, there are exceptions — that I think draw people together.
                    It's quite unique and very rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Louise, in previous conversations I have noticed that
                        you seemed to be very fond of India. You started to talk about the schools
                        there. Can you tell me a little bit more about India and about what were the
                        attractions for you and your family, the various things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WEISS: There are so many I wouldn't know where to start. India was a huge
                    country. It's as large as all of Europe. Geographically, it has the highest
                    mountains in the world and down to the far south. Many, many different
                    languages, different ethnic backgrounds. So there's that variety that's almost
                    endless. When I think of India, I think of brilliant colors, not only the bright
                    sun, but the women wore brilliant saris of bright red with gold trim and so on.
                    Gardens in the winter were very colorful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what it was like when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes. And music. Everything was very different to us, the music, the
                    languages, the landscape. Everything was very, very different from anything we
                    had experienced before within Europe, but we had not been in that part of the
                    world. It's very different.</p>
                <p>I was very enthusiastic about being there and learning as much about it as I
                    could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn the language before you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I didn't have an opportunity before I went, but I studied Hindi there. One
                    of the marvelous things about being posted there was the orientation we had when
                    we arrived. There was money available at the embassy, money [counterpart funds]
                    that was earned by our food and other aid to India. The Indians repaid us in an
                    amount of money that could be spent only in India. A lump of it was used for an
                    orientation course for newcomers. Ambassador Bowles insisted that every employee
                    in the embassy not come to his office until he had taken this course. People and
                    families arrive in the summer, so we attended in the summer. Children above age
                    16, or something like that, were invited to attend. It was a two-week training
                    course at the University of New Delhi, which is in Old Delhi. We were picked up
                    every morning by an embassy van, which would come to the neighborhood where the
                    Americans lived. I jumped into the van, and we took our lunch with us. It would
                    go on to pick up another wife and others and on to other places where American
                    lived. Not just Americans. There were some Canadian nurses. I think anyone who
                    was interested, who fit certain requirements, could attend.</p>
                <p>Then there was a long drive around the city, out to the university. This was at a
                    time when there had been a lot of flooding. The rivers had flooded. So, as we
                    drove around Ring Road, similar to our Beltway, but not quite the same, we could
                    see the flooding from the river covering acres and acres of ground, which forced
                    a lot of people to move out of their homes and shanties on to the roads. Many of
                    them were living in big, round sections of sewer pipe that had not been laid.
                    There were just living there. So we could see that, and that was an eye
                    opener.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the poverty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WEISS: Yes. And then out through the Old City. We had lectures by people from the
                    government. We were told about the geography of India, which is vast. We would
                    be given a lecture by the agricultural minister about that.</p>
                <p>Oh, I should go back, because I think the first day we were given a session at
                    the embassy about the roles of our husbands or families in the embassy itself.
                    Why were they there? They were there because we had a big AID mission, Peace
                    Corps. Rockefeller Foundation and Ford were there. All of these things were
                    explained to us so that we realized what the roles of the Americans were, not
                    just our husbands, but others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what is America doing in India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, and then we learned from the government and other officials what
                    India was like, what India had to offer. History. Lectures like this in the
                    morning, and then we'd break for lunch; and then in the afternoon there were
                    optional tours to some of the historical sights or museums. Things of that
                    kind.</p>
                <p>One of the lectures I remember was by an American missionary woman who had
                    written a book called, Behind Mud Walls. I had read the book. I think she had
                    lived in India as a missionary wife for something like 40 years, in a village. I
                    expected to see a woman that looked very different. She came out dressed in a
                    linen dress, with a scalloped linen collar and cuffs. She looked very dainty. A
                    beautiful surprise. She told us about their work in the village and what life in
                    the village was like.</p>
                <p>So we learned a great deal in our first two weeks through this orientation
                    course. It was superior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did this orientation last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I think it was two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two weeks, yes. Seems like a very good introduction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, it was excellent. You couldn't duplicate it back here at all. You
                    could duplicate some of it, perhaps, but not in the same way. These trips in the
                    afternoons, the visits to historical sights or a village, each one led by an
                    Indian to explain it to us, gave us an early experience in the kind of country
                    we were living in.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You mentioned that Indira Gandhi spoke at the
                        international school. Were there other major events that happened during
                        your posting in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, yes. We arrived in the summer, and in the fall — was it November? —
                    President Kennedy was shot, was assassinated. That was a very dramatic event in
                    India. Ambassador Bowles had been recalled to Washington before that had
                    happened, so he wasn't there. Mrs. Bowles asked any of the wives who could to
                    come and help serve, volunteer to come and help serve during the day, to stay at
                    the official residence to help her when Indians and diplomats would be coming to
                    pay their respects. There's always a book that's signed [located] outside the
                    door with an American marine guard in uniform and the flag, and then the book.
                    People would come up to that and sign and usually come in and speak to her and
                    make some comments. So I helped with that. I believe there was a ceremony at the
                    end, on the front steps. The Indians just poured out in droves to respond to
                    this. It was just absolutely amazing.</p>
                <p>I can't remember whether it was the following spring, Prime Minister Nehru died,
                    and that was another very dramatic event in the history of India and the world.
                    Everything stopped. I believe the embassy was closed. At least, people were
                    encouraged to attend the service, which was held at the ghat, the burning ghat
                    on the edge of the river. There was a tremendous parade, not parade, but
                    cortege. Nehru's body was raised on some kind of a platform on wheels. I
                    remember it looking strange because this was, I think, in May or June when it's
                    the absolutely hottest weather of the year in India. The reason it looked so
                    distorted was that they had packs of ice over the body, covered with some kind
                    of a shroud; and on top of that it was cluttered with marigolds and flowers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you have pictures of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I think so. Other events that were annual, but very exciting and
                    interesting — you learned a lot — were the annual national day parades, their
                    national day parades, in January of every year, when every state in India was
                    represented with dancers, or whatever. Elephants all decked out in their jewels
                    and the maharajahs under the umbrellas, and, of course, military units, dancers
                    and so on. This was quite a long parade. It went on for hours. Receptions. In
                    the evening, there was what was called “the beating retreat.” Rashtrapati
                    Bhavan, the prime minister's residence, was lit all around the edges. It was
                    lighted in the sunset. There was a review of troops and, I think, a bugler or
                    some kind of musician standing silhouetted against the sunset. That was another
                    dramatic thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>There was a war between Pakistan and India — I think that was 1965, but I'm not
                    sure of the date — when we had to observe a curfew. We even had to cover windows
                    with black. Had to stay indoors. I remember worrying that my family at home were
                    more concerned about us than we were ourselves. But there were tanks coming from
                    Pakistan across the desert in India, Pakistan tanks that we had supplied to
                    Pakistan, and planes in the sky that we had provided and sold to the Indians. So
                    we provided the war materiel on both sides, and I thought this was rather
                    strange.</p>
                <p>One of our wonderful early experiences with the children was spending a summer on
                    Lake Dal in Kashmir. Many of the foreigners did that. There were houseboats on
                    the lake that had been built by the British. In so many ways, the British were
                    not allowed to buy property, I believe, so they built the houseboats and used
                    those. During the hot weather they all went up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: That led to opportunities to trek up into the mountains. Kashmir is a
                    beautiful, beautiful place, and a nice respite from the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far away is that from New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I couldn't tell you in miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, when you traveled, several hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Several hours, I think. We didn't drive. I believe we flew up. Some people
                    would drive.</p>
                <p>And we had other vacations in the hill stations.</p>
                <p>Another [time] was when we had R and R leave, we could take it in Bangkok or Hong
                    Kong with the children. Those were opportunities to get away, to have a change,
                    to buy clothing and bring back some food from the stores for our own use, and to
                    get a change. Hong Kong was marvelous, as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes, I should know, since I'm from Hong
                        Kong.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WEISS: And, of course, India is so far from the other side of the world that
                    whenever we went out and when we returned for good and during our home leave, we
                    literally traveled around the world. We'd go in one direction to get there and
                    the other direction coming back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of the weddings in India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, the weddings are, well, I think not the word “circus,” because they
                    really aren't circuses; but those are beautiful affairs, very complicated,
                    complex, powerful, noisy. We were invited to many of them, as our friends were.
                    The Indians feel honored if they have an American or foreigner come to their
                    weddings.</p>
                <p>There was one across the street from us that our son went to. He came back and
                    said, “Guess who I met? I met Prime Minister Shastri (this was after Nehru's
                    death) across the street, at my neighbor's house!”</p>
                <p>The Hindu weddings are, as I said, very elaborate. The groom arrives on
                    horseback, all festooned in colorful garb. The horses also. With musicians. Part
                    of the street of the house where the wedding would take place was cut off to
                    traffic. They festooned it with floral gates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it usually at the groom's house or at the bride's
                        house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: At the bride's house. The parents of the bride spent thousands and
                    thousands of dollars. Even out in our compound where the servants lived, there
                    was a wedding; and you can imagine how little they had to begin with, but they
                    saved money and spent money for the food and for musicians and dancers for
                    something like a wedding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it lasted for days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, yes. I don't think there are any weddings anywhere in the world like
                    those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if they still do it that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I think they probably do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem with Tibetan refugees at the time,
                        also?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WEISS: Tibetan refugees had come into India, well, came with the Dalai Lama,
                    trekked over the mountains. When we lived there, there was a Tibetan settlement
                    in Dharmsala, which was, in effect, their new capital. They had a school there.
                    There were many of them in New Delhi, and there was something called Tibet House
                    in New Delhi. The Dalai Lama would come in and there would be a ceremony of one
                    kind or another. We'd be invited to those things. Many of the Tibetan refugees,
                    who were living in Dharmsala, would come into New Delhi in the winter months,
                    the cooler months, to sell their crafts. Not their crafts, but things that they
                    had brought out of Tibet they were selling. Beautiful old ritual pieces of
                    silver and brass. Things of that kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: And jewelry and gemstones. Our children became quite interested. There was
                    a woman named Chanda who would come to our house and come in and sit on our
                    living room floor or on the verandah and open up her parcels and bags of things
                    and spread them out. Our children were very interested in not only seeing what
                    she had and buying some of them — our son got very interested in buying
                    gemstones — but also in talking with her. I recall when our daughter graduated
                    from the school and went back to New York to go to college at Sarah Lawrence,
                    Chanda noticed that Susan wasn't there. And I said, “Oh, yes, I miss her so
                    much, but she's at college and now it's just David at home.” And she expressed
                    to me her feelings about being without her daughter, because she had to be
                    separated from her family. So that was kind of a new connection we had with each
                    other. I felt very close to Chanda in many ways. She had a lovely personality,
                    low-key. She wasn't a hard seller in any way. She was very low-key.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She came from Tibet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: She was one who had come from Tibet. Her husband traveled around India
                    buying things to add to what they were selling. She would come to New Delhi in
                    the wintertime and do the selling. Then they would be together later. So she was
                    without her children.</p>
                <p>Our son, one year, was invited by a young Peace Corps volunteer to go with him to
                    Dharmsala to see the Tibetan community out there. They had their own school.
                    They had their own rituals for religion and culture. . . . used to tell me about
                    this. They were very. . . . They wanted to carry on, to give back to their
                    children as much of their own culture and history and everything else that they
                    could, although they were no longer in their own country. They knew what was
                    happening to their country, but they wanted their children to know it all, as
                    much as they could. That's something that David learned and was impressed
                    by.</p>

                <p>WEISS: I don't know offhand. I imagine there were thousands. I think most of them
                    came into India. Some came to the U.S. I met some here. But I think, mainly, the
                    ones with families, the kind of colony, stayed in India. I suppose some of their
                    leaders were the ones who came abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they would travel back to Tibet to visit the
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I don't think at that time they were allowed to travel into Tibet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: No, I believe not. I think later, China opened it up, and that wasn't too
                    many years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they really had left the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: They had fled. They were expatriates. Yes, they had left their country, as
                    always, with hope and determination that they could and would go back. I don't
                    know how many have gone back. All those who have gone back must be having a very
                    difficult time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, it seems like you and also your children who
                        enjoyed India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, very much! My husband was the economic counselor and later, minister;
                    and, as was required by him, he made a lot of trips around the country and
                    wanted me to go with him as much as I could. I thought that was a marvelous
                    opportunity to get to know the country and the people and the kind of contacts
                    he had with economic projects around the country. I wouldn't have missed it for
                    the world. In retrospect, I wonder how it affected my children, being away for
                    days on end, off and on all the time. It wasn't that frequent, but I think they
                    understood and wanted me to go. But they were in school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had help at home.</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WEISS: We had help. I wouldn't have left them if we hadn't had help. We not only
                    had a staff at the house, but they lived on the property. I believe the bearer
                    would stay in the house when we were away. We insisted on that. And Len's
                    secretary, Ruth Butler, who had gone out from Washington with him, lived in
                    staff quarters on the embassy grounds itself. She was unmarried, and when we
                    would go on trips like this, I would ask her if she would like to come and stay
                    at the house, and she did. The children knew her, and I felt...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Louise, we were just talking about your travels with
                        your husband in India, and leaving your children at home, but you did have
                        help and all that. Was there something else you wanted to add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, there were some anxieties on my part, leaving the children at home.
                    That they were safe, I wasn't worried about that. They were in good hands. But
                    in perspective, I wondered if it might have affected them adversely. They didn't
                    say anything about it at the time. These were their teen years and pre-teen
                    years, when children are, at least the older ones, drawing away from family in
                    their own way and not talking about everything personal. I just wish that maybe
                    I'd been more available, although I was available. But perhaps it's knowing more
                    now and wishing I'd known it then. I think we did as much as we could at the
                    time for and with them. We wanted to be with them all the time. We couldn't
                    always.</p>
                <p>The representational duties or obligations, responsibilities, were very heavy in
                    New Delhi. It was a very large post.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your husband is in a senior position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, he was the counselor minister, and there were CODELs (Congressional
                    Delegations) from Washington and VIPs visiting all the time. So there was a lot
                    of entertaining going on, not only on our part, in our home, but in other homes
                    and hotels. Receptions, dinners, luncheons. Sometimes several in one day or
                    evening, five or six days a week. We all tried to keep Sundays sacrosanct for
                    the family, but there would be exceptions. I just feel I wish I could do it over
                    again and do it a little more thoroughly. I think I did a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in India, your father got very ill and
                        passed away.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WEISS: My father was very ill when I left. I think it was when we first left,
                    departing for India, we went up to see him. He was in a wheelchair. He had
                    cancer. He lived in upstate New York. I wouldn't see him that often and, of
                    course, had been away during our foreign service years. I went up to see him,
                    and when we said good-bye, I could tell by the look in his eyes that he knew we
                    wouldn't see each other again. And that hurt me. It crushed me. It tore at my
                    heart. He was very frail, very weak. My mother was there and my younger brother
                    lived in the same area, so I wasn't concerned in that respect; but I felt very
                    badly that we were going so far away because I knew I wouldn't be able to get
                    back easily to visit him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: No, not before he died. We went — I believe it was our first Easter
                    vacation time — went on a trip with the children when they were out of school.
                    We went on a trip to Hyderabad, or some place, with them. Stayed in a beautiful
                    hotel, palace hotel, which had been a former maharajah's palace. A beautiful
                    place. When we arrived, there was a cable that the embassy had forwarded,
                    announcing my father's death, and it upset me very much for the obvious reasons,
                    but I knew that since I was so far away, I wouldn't be able to get back easily
                    and quickly in time for his funeral. I think there was not a compassion leave
                    allowance at the time. If there had been, I didn't know about it and didn't ask
                    about it. I did not get back. Tried to, but it was just so far and with
                    complications to making arrangements to get there it just didn't work out, and
                    so I didn't come back. I'm his only daughter, and so it meant a lot to me that I
                    wasn't able to go back. That's one of those things you have to accept in the
                    foreign service.</p>
                <p>On the other end of that scale, I recall, before we went into the service, we
                    were getting to know about it while we were still here, and hearing stories
                    about life in the foreign service. remember one woman told me that they — I
                    believe they were being assigned to India — and both mothers of both the couple
                    were widows, and both of them were going to live with them in India, as
                    dependents. Can you imagine? Two mothers, mothers-in-law, living in this family.
                    I asked her how that worked out. Anyway, I thought that was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An interesting situation. Mary Louise, maybe you can tell
                        me a little bit of the change of perspective over the years with the foreign
                        service. The different posts, experience in DC, whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, looking back, I'm sure the foreign service affected all of us in the
                    family. Our son came into the foreign service himself and was in for 10 years
                    and then left to stay in the job he's in now. Both our children recognized that
                    there were problems, but said they would do it again. They felt it was
                    worthwhile in every wonderful sense. It was worth the hazards and the problems
                    and the sacrifices.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Nowadays, the foreign service families face things that we didn't have to face.
                    Things like terrorism. Although when we were in Bangladesh, after Leonard
                    retired from the service — he was with the World Bank mission there — there were
                    three coups. I don't recall any acts of terrorism in other posts. There were
                    plenty of things that went on during our years in India. I mentioned the war. It
                    was a brief war, but it was a taste of war, a taste of anxiety. I worried about
                    my family at home worrying about me out there. I wish that I had had more
                    professional training myself that I might have used, though I would not change
                    the way I led our lives at post as a mother and wife; and I don't see how I
                    could have done those things if I'd had a career.</p>
                <p>I managed to do some writing when I was abroad. Writing's a wonderful career to
                    have. It's very flexible. You can take it with you anywhere, fit it in wherever
                    you want. And I have written quite a bit about it.</p>
                <p>Bonn, coming after India — we were posted to Bonn after India — was not only a
                    relief, it was a great contrast. It was sort of going back home in a way because
                    it was a Western, more familiar culture, even the language I was studying. I
                    hadn't studied German before, but it seemed all very familiar. The history was
                    more familiar. My mother's side of the family came originally from Germany in
                    the 18th century. I just felt much closer to it, and I felt very comfortable
                    there. I think we all did. Wonderful opportunities to jump in the car with our
                    cameras on weekends and just drive. You'd see a sign that would say “to the
                    Netherlands” or “to Belgium” a few miles away. We did a lot of traveling with
                    the children. It was easier for our daughter to come from college and visit us
                    there, a shorter distance to get home. But it was a great contrast and a
                    comfortable one. Not that India wasn't comfortable, but there were other kinds
                    of differences that we had to cope with, understand, in India. It seemed much
                    more complex than Germany.</p>
                <p>While we were there, President Johnson came to visit. That was a big hullabaloo
                    in many ways. They make so much of these things. The embassies have to, for
                    security reasons.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Bonn.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WEISS: This was in Bonn. The astronauts who had first landed on the moon came to
                    Bonn, as they did in those days after every early space mission. When they
                    returned to earth, the three or four of them world travel abroad, around the
                    world, to visit cities, capitals, usually, and talk about the American space
                    mission. I suppose it was a big PR thing, but they came to Bonn. I remember
                    watching the space mission in our home when there was a landing. How did it
                    work? No, I'm thinking of one, it wasn't a landing on the moon. It was the one
                    prior to that, probably an exploratory one, where they went around the moon.
                    Later, we met the astronaut — Borman? — who was in that, who came to Bonn with
                    his wife and was given all the VIP treatment. At the time, we escorted them. I
                    can't remember. Len wasn't charg� d'affaires, but for some reason we were
                    assigned to escort them. I remember Borman's wife telling me that — I may have
                    asked her the question, what was it like watching your husband on the
                    television, going through this thing? — and she said, “Well, the hardest part
                    was when they went around behind the moon and they lost radio contact.” You can
                    imagine what that would feel like, not being able to see or hear. Anyway, they
                    came back into radio contact. You can imagine what that would feel like, not
                    being able to see or hear. Anyway, they came back safely.</p>
                <p>I remember in Bonn, on several occasions, meeting and perhaps sitting next to a
                    dinner guest, World War II veterans, German veterans who are now high in the
                    ministries, being very reluctant to have the subject of the World War II come
                    up, because they had such guilty feelings about it. Many of them had. . . . I
                    remember one had only one arm. Another had a patch over his eye. They'd been
                    veterans who had suffered a great deal physically, as well as in other ways.
                    Trying to put myself into their feelings. We were the winners of the war, so to
                    speak, and they were winners in the beginning, but not at the end. Their not
                    wanting to talk about it. I think one of them said, “It will take another
                    generation before we can really feel easy to talk about it.” Things like that
                    are impressions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any surprises over the years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, I guess good and bad. Some of the surprises were running a household
                    with servants, which I hadn't been used to. In India there was a staff of five.
                    I wasn't used to that. They were all men. I wasn't used to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I tried to change it, as many American women did. We thought this was
                    superfluous. Why did we need two bearers and a cook and a sweeper and so on, and
                    a laundry dhobi to do the laundry and a gardener? We tried to change it,
                    thinking, in our American way, that this would be more democratic; but I came to
                    realize that they were dependent on the American embassy — because we lived in
                    embassy property — they were dependent on us as a family, as with the previous
                    family in that house, and the next one would be. They had quarters on the
                    property. They lived there with their old parents and their young children. If
                    we had fired one of them, or tried to get a job for one of them, which I did try
                    to do with a bearer, it would mean that they would lose their house. They would
                    have to move. The house was just a one-room affair. Their children would have to
                    go to a different school. They would lose the little community they had of their
                    own out there. We even had a garden for them that was their garden for their
                    vegetables and so on. So I realized that it was like a little community, and
                    even if we could find them a job with another family, they would lose all of
                    that and have to move. It was an upheaval that they didn't want, and I realized
                    they would prefer to stay. So we went along with it. It was a system that seemed
                    colonial and superfluous, but it stayed because there were reasons for it.</p>
                <p>It's hard to deal with some of those things. You try to do your best. You're
                    thinking in your own cultural terms, but you have to think in theirs also
                    because you're in their country, and it's their lives that are at stake.</p>
                <p>Other surprises, things I didn't expect to happen. I think these are things I
                    expected, I knew about in advance, but didn't realize what they would literally
                    be like when we were dealing with them and living with them. I think the
                    kindness that shows through in different cultures when there's no language
                    connection, the kind of big, human family, you can tell by a smile on a person's
                    face or some little gesture of generosity. The welcoming effort would come from
                    people you really don't know anything about. You're in their country. You were
                    their guests, but it makes you feel part of them because you see this response
                    that's so human and so much like your own.</p>
                <p>There's another side to it, too, the poverty and the turmoil, the killing, things
                    of that sort that are distressing; but they happen here, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I think possibly another surprise would be the reaction of our children. I
                    remember feeling that we always took with us our American home. We took as much
                    with us as possible in the way of books and records and games and pictures to
                    put on the wall and things of that sort, which made our home as much like home
                    back here as we could. I assumed that we were giving our children an American
                    heritage. When my daughter was older, in her teen years, and I was getting very
                    interested in the effects on our children, I asked her about that. Did she feel
                    she had a hundred percent American heritage while living there? And she said,
                    “Oh, no!” She said, “That's only part. My heritage is also in Yugoslavia. My
                    heritage is also India.” And that surprised me greatly. I'd never realized that
                    because I was thinking of American heritage on my own terms, my background, my
                    family history; and I assumed we took that and passed it along. But she and
                    David had something that I didn't have, and that was living in these countries
                    where they inherited something that I didn't have. And that was a surprise to
                    me. I had taken all this for granted from my point of view, and she's the one
                    who told me that it was different with her. That was a surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very important to recognize the difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Very important, and I think if it's not done now, I think it's something
                    that the Foreign Service Institute might try to bring out in the orientation for
                    families going abroad, not to take for granted that your own background as an
                    adult is going to be the same you pass along to your children. They will have an
                    entirely different one. And if your children go out earlier, younger, and are
                    born abroad, it would be even more so. Our children didn't go abroad until they
                    were four and eight years old. They'd been born right here in Washington. So I
                    just assumed too much as a mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Louise, you've done quite a few interviews for the
                        oral history, the Foreign Service Spouse Oral History program. Tell me a
                        little bit about how you feel about the project as a whole and your
                        experience interviewing different people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Could I go back just a moment to what we were just talking about?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I don't know if this is a surprise, but one of the wonderful things,
                    positive things, that comes out of the foreign service life style — not so much
                    for us parents, but especially with our children — and that is the global view
                    that they get, that we get. I think in terms globally. I see the world as a
                    globe, as a big map. I'm very geographically oriented. Some people aren't. I'm
                    pretty sure our children think and feel the same way, and when it comes to
                    things that are going on around the world, we feel a definite connection and so
                    do they from this experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The oral history project tempted me right from the beginning, and I stayed with
                    it for about five and a half years now, and I'm phasing out of it. But I found
                    it very stimulating and a wonderful opportunity to stay connected with the
                    foreign service, especially with the women, because it started as a project to
                    interview foreign service women. The name changed to Foreign Service Spouse Oral
                    History so that we could include the male spouses of tandem couples. It is just
                    as important to get the male spouse's point of view as it is to get ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have there been many male spouses in the interviews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I know of at least one. I'm not sure whether Jewel has done others. I
                    haven't seen that interview, but I think it would be very interesting. I know
                    that she did at least one. I'm glad you're in it because I think the more
                    younger wives we have who are interviewers, whether they're doing transcribing
                    or whatever, and we've had some other younger ones who are now posted abroad, it
                    gives us older ones a more inclusive feeling that it's a generational thing that
                    just goes on and on from one generation to the next.</p>
                <p>We started interviewing the oldest women we could find, women in their eighties
                    who came into the service very early in the century because we wanted to get
                    their views while they could speak easily and comfortably about it. Then we
                    tried to branch out and get as broad a collection as we could, different age
                    groups, different backgrounds, different perspectives. I have thoroughly enjoyed
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your experience as an interviewer, were you every
                        surprised by things that were said by the people you interviewed, compared
                        to your own experience? Was it similar? Was it very different
                        sometimes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: I think there have been some. One thing that comes to mind is something
                    that was said to me by a wife who. . . . I was a Wristonee wife. I came in sort
                    of mid-career, in my husband's mid-career period. This other woman married a
                    foreign service officer and they went in, I think, right after school, after his
                    schooling, right after World War II; so she was in longer. There have been
                    several generations of foreign service in her family. When I spoke about being a
                    Wristonee wife and I think I said something to the effect that I didn't feel any
                    different, but I wanted to immediately become one of them. And she said, “Oh,
                    but we always felt superior.” I took it in the best way, but it surprised me,
                    because, again, I just took for granted that — maybe I was just naive — that I
                    came in at a different age and time than those that had come in earlier in their
                    lives, and I wanted to fit in. I'm sure I saw some differences. I think we all
                    respected, pretty much, each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>In my interviews with other women for this project I have realized how much other
                    women have coped with, some of the things that they've dealt with that were real
                    hardships, much more than I ever had. Longer separations. Children going off or
                    having to be sent abroad or back home to school when they were very, very young.
                    It just made me appreciate how strong and flexible foreign service women are.
                    Made me realize that our experiences were very rich and rewarding, with an
                    amount of problems and stresses, but not nearly as much as many, many women have
                    had to cope with. Naomi Matthews, I think, went into Afghanistan way, way back —
                    did she go in on camel back or something? — alone, without her husband. Long
                    travels by ship in the early days before even we went out by ship were just, at
                    times, very difficult during the war period, World War I, World War II. It was
                    very difficult. Many of them had to go without their husbands. Their husbands
                    had to remain back there, and they were evacuated. We've never been evacuated.
                    I've talked with many women who have. Many have put up with a lot more than I
                    have and come out very strong. Many have had personal and family problems that
                    were very severe, very traumatic, that we haven't had. I felt very fortunate in
                    that respect. It's the luck that we all have or don't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel by boat to Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Yes, our first travel as a family together by ship was wonderful. It was
                    about ten days altogether. I remember going through a lot of anxiety as we were
                    getting ready to go, not knowing what it would be like. A new kind of life. The
                    children were young. We were having to rent our house and put the furniture in
                    storage and take others with us, and we were wondering if the furniture would
                    come through and our dishes and so on. But I kept thinking to myself while I'm
                    home here doing all these chores, “We will have ten days on ship! I won't have
                    to cook! I won't have to clean house! I won't have to even answer a telephone!
                    It will be like going on a vacation!” And it was! It was marvelous. I worried a
                    little bit about David being four and wanting to fall overboard, but, of course,
                    there was a place where he could play. They ate in separate dining hours. They
                    had an early sitting for the children. One of us would accompany our children at
                    six o'clock, or whatever it was, and there'd be another parent with other
                    children. Then we'd take them back to the stateroom, put them to bed, put on our
                    fancy clothes and go to dinner ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, sounds like fun!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WEISS: It was a lot of fun. It was very relaxing. There was that feeling of not
                    knowing what was ahead, but being able to enjoy what you were doing at the
                    moment. Then we stopped in Naples. We had our brand new Chevy car with us, and
                    drove from Naples to Florence. We were doing some sightseeing. Then we drove
                    into Belgrade in our own car. That was going from one Western culture into
                    almost an extreme, in some ways. It's a long drive from Trieste down to
                    Belgrade, and we arrived in the dark. There was no place to stop and eat. We
                    couldn't understand the language. I suppose we had to stop and get gas. It all
                    was very, very strange. The children didn't understand it. But anyway, we
                    arrived in our own car.</p>
                <p>The trip to India and our home leave trips were also by ship. Going back after
                    home leave from India, Len had to be there at a certain time, and he and David
                    went ahead by themselves on one ship. I believe I was taking Susan to look at
                    schools. I can't remember why she and I followed later. I think that was the
                    reason, to look at colleges with her. My mother went along with us through New
                    England, looking at girls' colleges. So we went later by ourselves. But
                    traveling by ship was a beautiful thing because it was a nice interlude between
                    leaving home and arriving at your post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gives you a little time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: On the “Independence” and the “Constitution,” which were the ships that
                    went to the Mediterranean, there were other foreign service and military
                    families. We met them and shared experiences. We were able to eat as much as we
                    wanted, which was another experience for our children. David wanted mashed
                    potatoes at every meal. They couldn't get over the fact that they could order as
                    many desserts. So that was something that I think isn't done any more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: We fly in now. I think when we went the second time to India we traveled
                    by plane. The children were older and we stopped in Rome and Cairo and Israel,
                    doing some sightseeing along the way. So there are ways to break the trips now
                    that travel's so much faster. I'm sorry to see the ocean travel out of the
                    picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much more relaxing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: But the interviewing has made me appreciate my own experience much more
                    than I think I might have otherwise, and realize that others have had harder
                    experiences. Some have had better experiences, or more glamorous, perhaps. It
                    helps you weigh your own and evaluate it. There's a lot of evaluation that goes
                    on when we listen to others talking about their experiences, comparing your
                    own.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's a good way for you also to be connected to the
                        foreign service after your husband retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Oh, definitely. And I think that was one of the reasons I enjoyed it,
                    because I felt I was still very involved with foreign service in a very
                    different way. I still felt I was very much a foreign service wife. I don't feel
                    we've ever retired. But it's a wonderful way to still feel very connected, to go
                    on and on.</p>
                <p>One of the things that you appreciate when you're in a project like this is the
                    value it has historically. What we have been doing is building a history of the
                    women's role in the foreign service. It has changed over the years in many, many
                    ways, in some ways, similar to our society. Society changes also, and you can
                    see how the parallels are, as well as the contrasts, because there are foreign
                    service experiences, or foreign service aspects that we would not experience if
                    we were at home. And I think, as a history project, it will be very valuable to
                    younger people now, scholars. There'll be a book that should be very
                    valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly, it's very interesting for me because I can
                        learn through you, basically, a lot of things that I would. . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: Well, I'm delighted that you're in it and I'm delighted that you're my
                    interviewer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEISS: We're a different generation. You came from Hong Kong only 10 years ago!
                    In some ways, this is. . . . I can't say it's typical, but it's one of those
                    unique things in the foreign service that isn't too unique. You're a
                    foreign-born spouse, but you're one of us, and I'm part of your family. I like
                    to think of it, as I said, as a big family. And you're so interested. This
                    enthusiasm spreads. I hope that when you go to Athens and on to other posts that
                    you'll have some wonderful experiences and still have an interest in the overall
                    perspective of the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm looking forward to it. Mary Louise, I think it's
                        appropriate at this point to maybe think about Yugoslavia then and now, in
                        view of the fact that you served in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, for a few years,
                        and what is going on now in Yugoslavia. Maybe you have some comments, some
                        insights on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>WEISS: I can't help but think about it. It's very distressing. It's horrendous
                    what's going on, destroying beautiful Sarajevo and other cities and towns, and
                    the killing. The history of Yugoslavia is very. . . . If you understand a little
                    bit of the history, you can understand what's happening now.</p>
                <p>There are five ethnic groups that have been at odds with each other for
                    centuries. When we went to Yugoslavia in 1957, Tito was president. He had been a
                    partisan fighting in World War II with the communist faction. There was another
                    fighter, leader, by the name of Mikhailovic, who was fighting with the Chetniks.
                    These were the two resistance groups that were fighting against the Axis and, of
                    course, Tito won. He was a very strong leader as president and kept these ethnic
                    groups down. He held them down. He's gone, and now they're erupting again with
                    their eternal battles. My heart aches for those who are being persecuted and
                    killed, and I feel great pain for those who are doing the killing, too. We feel
                    more personally and deeply about these kinds of upheavals when we've lived
                    there, and we feel it about other countries where we've lived. And I'm sure
                    other people who've lived abroad feel the same way.</p>
                <p>Belgrade was our first foreign service post. We were there with our children. We
                    lived there for three years. We were unable, because of the political situation,
                    to get to know in a friendly way our neighbors or people my husband worked with,
                    the Yugoslavs. But there were Yugoslav local employees in the embassy, the
                    receptionist and so on. Len's driver. We got to know them and felt very warm
                    toward them as they did toward us. Our cook, Louisa, spoke German. I couldn't
                    speak with her until I learned a little more of the Serbian language. My husband
                    could speak with her. But there was a rapport between Louisa and us and our
                    children that was exceptional. She felt and acted as though she was one of the
                    family without being obvious about it. She was just that warm and comfortable
                    with us as we were with her. She took very good care of us, and so did Mitzi,
                    the maid. She wasn't quite as open about it. She didn't have German as a
                    language. I went into the market with Louisa. She took me to her church
                    services. I visited her in her little home when she was very ill. I took Mitzi
                    to the hospital when she broke her arm. So these were just natural feelings we
                    had.</p>
                <p>But there was a barrier between us, a kind of social contact with people that we
                    otherwise would be friendly with, colleagues of my husband in the government and
                    so on. But they're warm, intelligent, caring people. We loved going into the
                    countryside on weekends with our children. We'd take the car and drive out into
                    the country and stop in a village where there was wine to buy and watch them
                    dancing on the green, dressed in their costumes. There was always, on Sundays,
                    wagon loads of singing people on their way to a wedding. People of this sort
                    were very colorful. There was a distance. We couldn't get to know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that still created some certain kind of intimacy with
                        the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WEISS: We were very interested to know more about them and learn more. That's
                    what we tried to do, yes. Their culture and their crafts and their music. Had
                    personal with our servants. Our cook and maid and the driver were very warm
                    despite the overall political situation, which required that they report to the
                    police whom we were having for guests and so on. So it hurts very deeply when I
                    see people like them being evicted from their homes and seeing the cities and
                    the towns shelled and bombed by gunfire. I feel the same way about other places
                    where we've lived. Whenever disaster strikes in Bangladesh, floods and
                    hurricanes wipe out their homes and their life work, I feel deeply hurt.</p>
                <p>This morning at the swimming pool I was talking to this foreign service friend
                    who asked why I had to leave so hurriedly. I mentioned this interview and what I
                    would be talking about, and I mentioned what's going on in Yugoslavia and how we
                    feel about it. And she said, “Oh, yes! Bill and I felt the same way when Burma
                    was going through its political turmoil a few years ago.” So, after all, those
                    places were our own homes. Both places where we lived were our homes for years
                    when we lived there and so we have this feeling, emotional tie that develops,
                    just as it would if we lived in Chicago or any other place here. And that stays
                    with us and so when we hear in the news and see what's happening on the
                    television, we get very upset. We feel very badly about it. I'm sure that other
                    foreign service people feel the same way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you very much, Mary Louise. I think we have
                        come to the end of our interviews. I certainly have learned a lot from you.
                        It was very interesting to me.</hi>
