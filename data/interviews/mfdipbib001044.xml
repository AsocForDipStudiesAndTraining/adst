                <p>An interview with Peter O. Sellar</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: W. Haven North</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 21, 1999</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 21, 1999. The interview is with Peter O.
                        Sellar. Will you give us a thumbnail sketch of your career in AID as a
                        preamble to our interview? Just a very, very brief flavor of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Career overview</p>
                <p>SELLAR: Okay. I started in 1963, which was virtually at the beginning of AID, and
                    I retired 30 years later in 1993, so I was there for 30 years. During that time
                    I started as a Management Intern, worked in the Office of the Administrator and
                    in the Africa Bureau. About a year after I went on to the Tunisia desk in the
                    Africa Bureau and was an Assistant Desk Officer for a year or two, and then an
                    unusual thing happened in that a vacancy came up in USAID Guinea for the Program
                    Officer position. NormallI would not have been chosen for that so soon but I
                    spoke French and they needed somebody right away, so I got to go do that rather
                    than going to Tunisia as an Assistant Program Officer. That was a very
                    challenging and interesting time. I was there for two years, 21 months I guess,
                    and then I did three months' temporary duty in Liberia as Deputy Program
                    Officer, a much bigger and more structured program than the one in Guinea. Then
                    I came back to Washington and did a three-month TDY on the Nigeria desk while we
                    figured out what I was going to do for a long term assignment. I wound up
                    becoming a Capital Development Officer in the Africa Bureau for the next three
                    years, '68-'71, and then went into a four-year assignment as Program Development
                    Officer in the Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation, a central office
                    that was working with PVOs in attempting to promote PVO/AID collaboration and
                    funding. After that I spent a brief time, just about six months, as a Special
                    Deputy for Joint Commissions in the Office of Middle East Affairs, which was a
                    job that really existed because of the creation of Joint Commissions with Middle
                    Eastern countries after the Camp David accords. But at that point I was being
                    moved around because of mass downgrading and reductions in force (RIFs) in the
                    agency and was bumped from that job under RIF procedures into actually a much
                    better job as Assistant Director for Development in the Office for Central
                    American Affairs. I was there again for only a short time, six months. That was
                    a very interesting job because it was a joint State/AID office and I was
                    Assistant Director - number three in the office - and basically the AID Deputy
                    Director, also supervising State Desk Officers as needed from time to time. This
                    was the only office of its kind left in AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>From there I went to become chief of the Program Division in the Near East
                    Bureau's Planning Office. I was there for nine years, a very long time to be in
                    one job in AID, but the Obey amendment came along and drastically changed
                    everything in Washington in terms of foreign service versus civil service (GS)
                    positions and pretty much immobilized GS employees in the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you GS at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. I had a very unusual career in that I only spent two years overseas
                    and 28 years in Washington. There's a story behind that, but that's the way it
                    came out. So I was Chief of the Program Division and then Deputy Director of the
                    Near East Office of Development Planning (DP) from 1976 to 1985, during the time
                    when the programs were very large because of the Camp David Accords.</p>
                <p>From there, there was another organizational upheaval which resulted in my moving
                    when the Near East and the Asian Bureaus were combined and I became superfluous.
                    But I was more or less immediately hired by the Bureau of Latin American and
                    Caribbean Affairs' Office of Development (LAC/DP) as Senior Analyst for Central
                    America and Special Assistant to the Director. That was pretty close to the
                    beginning of what's been called the Central America Initiative, so that was a
                    program which was very large and very visible at the time. I was there for five
                    years, from 1985 to 1990, during which time the Democracy Program began and a
                    little office was started to run it. I was the analyst for that program as well
                    as for Central America. I was very interested in it, and was invited by the
                    Director of that Office, the Office of Democratic Initiatives in LAC, to come in
                    as the Senior Program Officer. I did that from 1990 to 1993. At that point I was
                    eligible for retirement and I did retire.</p>
                <p>Early Years and Education</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's now go back to your early years. Where you were
                        born, where did you grow up, what schooling did you have? Were there any
                        experiences that suggest why you got into international work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, my early years were spent in Connecticut and New Jersey, sort of on
                    the rim of the New York commuter belt. My father was an accountant and
                    successful businessman so I had an affluent upbringing. I went to private
                    schools from the first grade in New Jersey and then to prep school in
                    Massachusetts for four years and then to Harvard. However, because our affluent
                    circumstances had changed drastically and quickly, in college I was a
                    scholarship student and received less and less support from home. So it actually
                    took me seven years to get through Harvard. I got my BA in 1961 after being in
                    the class of '58 originally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: American History and Literature, with no particular focus on
                    international affairs except that I took French all along. I was something of a
                    Francophile and my father had retired back to Scotland which was where he had
                    immigrated from, just as I was entering college. He owned a commercial salmon
                    fishing business in Northeast Scotland, kind of a rural area, so I spent several
                    summers working in that. I would work for say six weeks or so and then spend
                    another month or six weeks studying in France, or pretending to study in
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why this fascination with France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it was a combination of things: the language, the literature, the
                    food, the women, the style, the French films. I had studied the language in
                    secondary school. So I had that international experience and also the experience
                    of working in the fishing business in Scotland, which it turns out was very
                    similar to many less developed country experiences, although I only realized
                    that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of work did you do in the fishing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I was just a fisherman; rowed the boat, hauled nets, boxed the fish,
                    carried them up to the ice house and packed them in crushed ice and sent them
                    off to Aberdeen. When my father died after I started to work for AID, I had to
                    go over and run the business. I took a six-month leave of absence from AID. At
                    that time I sold the business because my mother was American and wanted to come
                    back here, and the business was really the only asset in my father's estate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Findhorn, Scotland, which is on the Northeast coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SELLAR: F-I-N-D-H-O-R-N. It has subsequently become quite famous as a New Age
                    community, which was starting when I was there, but I didn't know about it.
                    Anyway, I had that kind of international background, having been to Europe a few
                    times growing up and going through college. I really had thought I would
                    probably go on into academia in literature, but I decided late in the day while
                    in college that I really didn't want to do that. I didn't know exactly what I
                    did want to do, but I figured that doing something international would probably
                    be interesting, so I went to the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
                    University for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: This was in 1961-62. I only stayed one year because I was so completely
                    out of money that there was no possibility of staying longer or continuing my
                    education further. Ideally I would have gone on to business school or law school
                    after that. In any event I had the year, and during that year I got very
                    interested in economic development, even though I had no background in economics
                    in college. I took a course they offered in economic development which I found
                    mostly incomprehensible, but it made me aware of the existence of this entire
                    aid world and the problems of poverty that existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of the faculty stand out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, we had Charlie Kindleberger and someone else teaching that
                    incomprehensible economics course, which consisted largely of diagrams showing
                    trade effects of different policies. And other professors certainly do stand
                    out. We had Leo Gross, who taught the legal history of international
                    organizations, and Albert Imlah, who taught European diplomatic history, which I
                    found incredibly difficult and tedious. Dr. George Hahn taught the basic
                    international economics course. I found the work very difficult because I hadn't
                    taken basic economics in college and the assumption there was that you had. But
                    I passed all of the courses except the development economics course, and then
                    took a course at Harvard Summer School to complete the course requirements for
                    the MA degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did get your MA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I did, but not then. I actually got the MA in 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to finish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SELLAR: In 1961-62 I did the course work, but I failed the oral exam. Because I
                    was so broke I had to go to work, and I figured that with the people involved in
                    the oral exam there was a low probability that I would pass it while they were
                    still there. It made no difference to AID so I just put it out of my mind and
                    went on with my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to write a thesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I did in 1994, when I finally completed the degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you write on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I wrote on the issues and problems encountered during the first 10 years
                    of the AID Democracy Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll come back to that. Very interesting. Then what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Joined USAID in the Office of Management Planning and the Africa Bureau -
                    1963</p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was then that I really got interested in economic development, so, of
                    course, we were applying for jobs during that year. I came down to Washington
                    and interviewed at AID and USIA and Commerce, and I was taking the Foreign
                    Service exams too, for the State Department. I thought AID was what I really
                    wanted to do. I passed the Foreign Service exams, so I could have done that, but
                    I thought I would be more comfortable at AID working on problems of poverty and
                    not having always to be supporting every U.S. foreign policy position, including
                    some I might not want to support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into AID? Were you a Management
                        Intern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, I took the Management Intern Exam, which was a Civil Service wide
                    exam, and passed that. At the time I assumed that was the only way you went to
                    work for AID. I had no knowledge of the parallel foreign service entry system,
                    which I guess at the time was called Junior Officer Training. I guess there was
                    also an exam for that - I don't know - but I was told only about the Management
                    Intern Exam and took that. Again, with AID just beginning to form there was
                    probably heavier input of Civil Service people than Foreign Service initially
                    despite the fact that we were a Foreign Service agency. Of course, there is a
                    whole history to that resulting in the Obey Amendment, which drastically
                    reversed that later.</p>

                <p>SELLAR: 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the agency in your first year;
                        did you get a good orientation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, I did. I was sort of awed by AID, because I only had that one year
                    at Fletcher, really a rather thin background, and had no relevant work
                    experience except the salmon fishing. But I felt good about my initial
                    assignments. I was assigned to the Office of Management Planning, with the
                    people who really brought me into AID, and I found myself after having been
                    there for about a week being given the assignment of writing a publications
                    policy for the agency.</p>
                <p>The Office of Management Planning was the branch that served the Administrator
                    and Deputy Administrator with recommendations for reorganizations, staffing
                    levels, and miscellaneous policy issues such as the publications policy that it
                    wasn't logical to send anywhere else. It was a small staff and they had bright
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any issues in writing a policy paper your first week?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, yes. I felt utterly inadequate to do it, but I was told that there
                    was a Publications Office under scrutiny by the Deputy Administrator that was
                    turning out an enormous amount of stuff. In those days they were broadcasting
                    technical papers on virtually everything. The Deputy wondered why we needed that
                    much stuff or even any of it. The Publications Office, of course, tried to
                    defend itself, so they provided a rationale for what they were doing. It was
                    really just up to me and my supervisors to come up with recommendations that
                    tried to reconcile the two differing view points. We did recommend cutting back
                    on some of the stuff being broadcast; but we also said that we believed there
                    was definitely a function for the office, that there needed to be a centralized
                    office, and that it shouldn't be put out of business. I think that really was
                    the issue. Actually I was commended by the Deputy Administrator for a fine
                    paper, so it worked out well.</p>
                <p>The other significant assignment in that office was to edit the manuals being
                    written to merge the two predecessor agencies into AID. One was the Development
                    Loan Fund, which was capital projects, and the other was the International
                    Cooperation Agency, which was the technical assistance and humanitarian aid.
                    Although AID had been created I guess a year or two earlier, the manual orders
                    were still being written.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of issues, concepts did you have to wrestle
                        with, because that's a very interesting stage in AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Honestly, I don't remember dealing with any major issues. I was so new, I
                    didn't really know anything and I was just working as an editor. I would take
                    something that was being drafted somewhere else and edit it. I remember that I
                    made something of a hit by, on the urging of my supervisor, ruthlessly editing a
                    thirteen-page paper down to three pages and having the person who wrote it say
                    he thought I had improved it in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a challenge. Any feel for the different
                        philosophies or attitudes of the two different agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think their differences showed for a long time in AID in the sense that
                    you had loans seen as being separate and different from grants, and requiring
                    different kinds of analysis and expertise. Loans were normally capital projects
                    - infrastructure or financial - and grants were normally technical assistance.
                    The Loan Officer mentality was somewhat different from the Program Officer
                    mentality. The Program Officer was someone who usually occupied himself
                    primarily with issues of technical assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see different approaches to program planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. On the one side the loan officers were very project oriented, and I
                    think they also tended to believe the prevailing theory of development at the
                    time, which was capital formation: if you could just help countries build their
                    airports, their roads, their infrastructure and private enterprise, that would
                    be the most important thing to do. The “hardware” of development. Also there was
                    a big emphasis on feasibility analysis for the projects because the projects
                    themselves should be self-financing as regards the economic and financial rate
                    of return. Whereas, on the technical assistance side they were looking at the
                    “software” aspect of development in terms of human resource development, health,
                    education, training, and subjects that didn't lend themselves as readily to
                    cost-benefit analysis but were looked at in terms of whether they were cost
                    efficient or cost effective, and I think that the people on that side tended to
                    believe that those were really the most important aspects of development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it difficult to bring the two together in a
                        common guide?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SELLAR: No. Other people were actually doing the drafting. I was just doing the
                    editing. I was the new face on the block and had some editorial experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very educational task for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, it was a perfect assignment as an introduction to the agency because
                    I learned about both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other assignments that stand out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I had only one other assignment; I didn't do a general rotation through a
                    number of offices. That is technically supposed to be done, but I was in
                    Management Planning for six months and that was fine with me because it was also
                    a good vantage point from which to see the rest of the agency and understand who
                    did what and how it was organized. And I got very good briefings from the people
                    I was working for. The last half of my first supposedly rotational year was
                    spent in Africa DP, Office of Development Planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your function there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was just to be an Assistant Program Officer and participate wherever
                    possible in terms of the ongoing functions of the Program Office at a junior
                    level, and to learn about the agency programming process and the budget process,
                    and just to participate in it and learn the entire cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn anything special about the African
                        development situation in that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I got the impression that African development had a long way to go. It
                    was after all 1963 and a number of these countries had only become independent
                    very recently. Some of them still weren't even independent, I think. So my
                    impression was that they were beginning at the beginning, although there were
                    variations depending on the extent to which the former colonial powers had
                    developed the country's resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there a brief time, I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was about six months. It actually turned into an assignment there so I
                    was actually there for a full year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues you had to deal with at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I'm sure there were, but I'm not sure I can remember them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can come back to that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Okay.</p>
                <p>Assignment on the Tunisian Desk - 1964</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after that assignment you went on to the Tunisia
                        Desk? This was in 1964?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, and I was there for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Tunisia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, they were doing relatively well as compared to most African
                    countries. Of course in a way, you can say they are not even an African country,
                    but they are more of a Middle Eastern country, but they happened to be in the
                    Africa Bureau. They were much more advanced than most of the sub-Saharan African
                    countries, except for South Africa, but they still needed help with a lot of
                    things. We had a big program, and we had the luxury in those days of having
                    three desk officers. A chief officer and two assistant desk officers, of which I
                    was one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's just for Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. Of course, it would never be possible today to have three officers.
                    But it was a big program. We organized ourselves sectorally, so I took
                    agriculture and tourism and my colleague took the other sectors we were active
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in tourism in Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They were just trying to get started, actually, developing an organized
                    effort to be attractive. We, in fact, financed a tourism master plan for them,
                    although it was controversial as to whether we should be involved in tourism
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it controversial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, some people felt that it was inappropriate because it attracted
                    gambling and skimpily clad women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Corrupting society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. People also said it didn't really provide much in the way of
                    multiplier effects in the local economy. The only additional jobs created were
                    low level jobs cleaning rooms and being waiters and whatnot. Personally I felt
                    that wasn't true, that there was a lot that could be done with handicrafts as
                    well, and that, in any event, those low level jobs were jobs that hadn't existed
                    before. People were happy to have them, or they wouldn't have gone into them. So
                    there was some development even though it wasn't ideal. Also, it was just a fact
                    that for some countries tourism was the most important natural resource they
                    had. Tunisia has beautiful beaches and very interesting Greco-Roman remains and
                    other things that people would be interested in. It didn't have a lot of mineral
                    resources to work with, or too much on the agriculture side because of the dry
                    climate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to agriculture, what were we trying to
                        contribute in tourism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We contributed the proposed plan to help them get going, and beyond that
                    I can't tell you exactly how much further we went. I don't think we went much
                    further than that because the Mission Director who was sent out during this
                    period was one of the ones who didn't really like tourism. So I don't know that
                    they took it any further.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the main features of the plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I remember one suggestion was that we try to do something about the
                    flies, which were all over everything and everyone in Tunisia, and also to get
                    them to prepare their cakes in some other manner because they tasted rancid.
                    These were very specific recommendationI remember them because I personally
                    experienced the flies and the rancid-tasting cakes. In addition to these
                    specific things, there were obviously broader suggestions. How to develop the
                    Greco-Roman ruins and other sites to increase tourism expenditures, by such
                    means as staging events at them as they did in Egypt and other places. And start
                    putting in higher value hotels that would attract the higher income clientele,
                    because Tunisia had only low rate facilities on the beaches, and mostly Germans
                    came, who spent almost nothing. Things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in the agriculture sector, what were we trying to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I can't actually remember that with any precision. It's a dry country so
                    most of it I think was in livestock, helping them try to increase the
                    productivity of their herds. We also did an enormous amount of tree planting
                    under PL 480 Title II. I suppose you'd say that was more environmental and
                    natural resource conservation than agriculture, but the trees were used for fire
                    wood. It wasn't justified as being environmental at that point. It was justified
                    as a kind of a WPA program, job creation, even though obviously it wasn't
                    anything that we could sustain. Nevertheless there was a significant
                    unemployment in Tunisia, and this was one way to deal with that it in the short
                    term at least, and give the other developmental things going on a chance to take
                    root.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did the program work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any recollection of scale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a large scale program. I think we were employing around 50,000
                    Tunisians, a significant portion of the labor force. It was PL 480 Title II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was managing the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The Tunisian Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. You weren't involved in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your first venture into a developing
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think actually my first venture into a developing country was Scotland.
                    But I thought Tunisia was absolutely delightful. Tunisia is and was a charming
                    place. It has a French atmosphere, which I like, and has beautiful beaches and
                    flowers blooming and Mediterranean architecture. The country was running pretty
                    well, the air conditioners worked in the hotels, and there was an interesting
                    variety of restaurants. From what I could see of it from the work I was doing
                    there, it was delightful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the development condition of
                        the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I'd say it was a mid-level developing country, well above almost anything
                    else in Africa. Although there was some severe poverty, it wasn't as pervasive
                    as in most developing countries. In fact for many years I think we provided aid
                    to Tunisia long after we really should have stopped. I worked myself, to try to
                    phase it out. I always recommended that when I was in Africa/DP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Because they didn't need it nearly as much as most other countries. The
                    counter argument was that they could use it more effectively. Of course that's
                    an argument that went on forever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the main reason why we did not phase out and kept
                        going back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, I don't think so. I think probably the main reason was that the State
                    Department wanted us there. There were some security considerations in the Cold
                    War context, although not major ones. We didn't have any bases there, I believe.
                    Also, quite frankly I think both on the State and the AID side people wanted to
                    continue it because it was a very nice post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't find any State Department specialists wanting
                        to influence the structure of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No. Not the content or the structure of the program. It was really just a
                    question of the level of the program and continuing it rather than terminating
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Tunisians to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Very good. Very cooperative, and they seemed to be interested in what we
                    had to offer. They were much better educated than most of the folks I
                    encountered later in other countries. Very good to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any special issues you had to work on during two year
                        stint?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I can't really remember that there were any special issues other than the
                    ones we have already talked about. There were issues of program assistance
                    versus totally project assistance, which my boss Phil Birnbaum handled. He was
                    an exceptionally able guy, a Ph.D. economist. He just did the big issues
                    himself. My issues tended to be more sector or project-level, such as should we
                    be in tourism or not, and levels and types of programs and projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after your Tunisia assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Transferred to USAID/Guinea as Program Officer - 1966</p>
                <p>SELLAR: I was slated to go to Tunisia as Assistant Program Officer, which I was
                    greatly looking forward to, but then, as I mentioned earlier, the Program
                    Officer in Guinea had to be evacuated very quickly because his daughter fell out
                    of a window and broke her back. So they needed somebody in Guinea just as I was
                    about to go to Tunisia, and I was offered that job despite my youth and
                    inexperience. Guinea at the time was still a big program. It was the third
                    largest program in Africa when I got there. By the time I left it was virtually
                    gone. It was a phase down situation, and I'm sure they never would have sent me
                    there if the decision hadn't already been made that they were going to downgrade
                    the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Guinea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We were dealing with a turbulent situation in terms of the Government and
                    Sekou Tour�, the president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1966.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. The Chief of State was anti-American, leaning much more toward the
                    communist side, but he was like a pendulum that swung back and forth. They would
                    occasionally get fed up with the way the Russians were doing things and throw
                    them out and let us back in, and then get fed up with what we were doing and
                    throw the Peace Corps out and throw us out and let the Russians back. While I
                    was there, we had our program and the Russians and the Chinese were also there
                    and official relations were very frosty. Shortly after I got there, there was a
                    staged demonstration against the U.S. because of some paranoid thought in Sekou
                    Tour�'s mind that we had had something to do with his Foreign Minister having
                    been taken off a plane iGhana. He whipped up a mob that stormed the Ambassador's
                    residence and terrorized his wife and small child, although they didn't hurt
                    anybody. The people themselves, in fact, were not really hostile, they were
                    quite friendly. This event resulted in the Ambassador being recalled to
                    Washington on consultations for quite a while. I was moved into the residence as
                    a resident bodyguard, because I was the only available male bachelor. We were a
                    joint State/AID operation and all worked in the same building; the staffs of
                    both organizations were fairly small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To guard the residence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Really just somebody to make the Ambassador's wife feel a little more
                    comfortable. Just to have a man in the house. That led to some great stories.
                    There were other instances where the Peace Corps was thrown out at one point
                    because they were suspected of something. The government just didn't want
                    American people up country. So we were under house arrest for a few days. A few
                    of us, however, were allowed to circulate and let the Peace Corps volunteers
                    know — many of them lived in isolation — that there wasn't anything to worry
                    about, that nobody was being hurt. Things like this kept happening and they were
                    disruptive to the program. The Guinea government would abruptly decide that Pan
                    Am was doing something wrong and they would kick out Pan Am and invite Aeroflot
                    back in to basically run the Guinean airline. That happened while we were there.
                    All these things were making it difficult to run an AID program and were
                    reflective of tense and antagonistic political relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of program did we have; what were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, when I got there we were doing quite a bit. We had a large
                    industrial-vocational training project that was run by the Organization for
                    Rehabilitation and Training (ORT) so we could provide French-speaking personnel.
                    ORT was technically a U.S. organization but in reality got its staff from
                    Northern Africa and Europe. This was a very important project because it was
                    about the only thing in the country that managed to fix things. Electrical, air
                    conditioning, welding, technical level skills. All the useful things,
                    maintenance of heating units, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We had research stations upcountry staffed by Peace Corps volunteers.
                    When the Peace Corps was thrown out, we terminated that project. I can't
                    remember anything else in agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of training did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We had a large training program - 400 to 500 people. We were under
                    pressure to finish it. I spent a lot of time working to phase it down and out so
                    that the people who were training in the U.S. to replace expatriate instructors
                    would come back. We would schedule a year's overlap and then the expatriate
                    would leave. Then we had to bring in technical assistance again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Guinean people to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They were nice to work with. They are very nice people. The problem was
                    that because of the poor political relations between the governments, it was
                    risky for them to become too friendly. So there was virtually no social contact
                    with them.</p>
                <p>There was one exception. We had a USIA-sponsored jazz band come through. A big
                    Guinean crowd turned out for that, despite any risks. There was a resident USIA
                    person, but one of my Assistant Program officers had a large house, a perfect
                    spot for entertaining, and we invited a lot of people to a reception after the
                    concert. About a hundred Guineans came. But other than for something like that
                    we didn't see them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the living conditions there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They were okay. The most important thing was just to make sure you had
                    air conditioning. It was so humid all the time. I had a good experience there.
                    There were highs and there were lows. A lot of it depended on the status of my
                    love life, and on which weather cycle we were in. When it wasn't raining all the
                    time, you could get outside and play tennis and sail and take boat trips for
                    weekend swimming and picnics to a nearby island with a lovely beach. It was
                    harder when these activities were shut down during the rainy season.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular crisis or issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SELLAR: There was continuous crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe some of the crisis that occurred. Were you under
                        instructions to phase down the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We knew we weren't going to get money for any new projects. We'd only get
                    money for continuing projects as long as those projects were able to function.
                    The policy context was clear. One time I went to some lengths to get approval
                    for one individual to go for training back in the States, and sent in strong
                    justification for that. It was approved and then we got a note back from the
                    Office Director in Washington saying “Don't ever do that again.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any kinds of linkups with economic policy
                        changes at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: If so that had happened long before I got there. Nobody was attempting to
                    do it during my tenure, though I did have an economist on my staff when I first
                    arrived. But she wasn't really policy-oriented, and the position was eliminated
                    when she left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PL 480 , were you programming that as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We were, and we didn't do that in any enormously coherent strategic way.
                    There just wasn't that much interest, given the fact that we were phasing down
                    the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after Guinea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I left in 1968. I wasn't there for a full two years because things had
                    dried up to the point where there wasn't that much left to do. So they sent me
                    down to Liberia for three months. They had a vacancy in the program office. I
                    found it similar to Guinea, but also quite different. They were so obviously
                    influenced by the United States as opposed to the French cultural influence in
                    Guinea. I didn't like Liberia. They were corrupt. Though I shouldn't say that
                    because I didn't have any firsthand knowledge of it. I did get to make a long
                    trip through the interior of Liberia, staying with Peace Corps volunteers since
                    there were no other accommodations. We had to walk part of the way through the
                    jungle since there was no road. I formed a great admiration for the Peace Corps
                    volunteers, living in isolation from their peers in rural villages and only
                    seeing someone from headquarters once a week with mail. That trip is my most
                    vivid memory of Liberia. Otherwise, it was just office paperwork.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Then I went back to Washington, on home leave, with an onward assignment
                    as the AID Operations Officer for Niger. But when I was back here I met the
                    woman who is now my wife. I wasn't quite ready to ask her to marry me, but also
                    wasn't ready to go back to Africa without her, so I got myself assigned here in
                    Washington to a temporary position on the Nigeria desk. Then I got myself
                    assigned to the Africa Bureau Office of Capital Development (CDF).</p>
                <p>Work with the Africa Bureau Loan Office - 1968-1971</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about work in that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to be a loan officer as
                    well as a program officer. Those were the two main streams of activity in AID,
                    as we have already discussed. I had responsibility for a portfolio with about 15
                    different loans in four or five countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were these divided up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It wasn't sectoral and it wasn't regional. I think it was mostly just a
                    question of workload that determined who got which projects. The loan shop
                    wasn't that big. As I recall, implementation authority had been delegated to the
                    field to a great extent. Because once a proposed project was approved in
                    Washington, it was a project and then there was implementation and that was
                    mostly in the field. You needed engineers and loan officers out there to deal
                    with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. What were some of the significant projects that you worked
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I worked on the TANZAM highway, which was a big highway going through
                    eastern Africa - TAN being Tanzania and ZAM being Zambia. It was being done
                    portion by portion. I had to do the loan paper for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we doing the TANZAM Highway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We were creating necessary major infrastructure. It was before the New
                    Directions movement guided the agency emphasis toward the software stuff rather
                    than the hardware stuff. It was at a time when the agency had enough money to do
                    a lot of these capital projects, which progressively declined as funding
                    declined. So I did that one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues involved in doing that
                        project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: There was an issue actually with the bids. Our chief engineer in
                    Washington felt that all of the bids were too high and it should be rebid. That
                    drew the ire of the low bidder. This was an issue that went to the Deputy
                    Assistant Administrator, who by then was Phil Birnbaum. I supported the
                    rebidding because I thought the engineers knew what they were doing. They were
                    saying we could save a million dollars, which was a lot of money in those days,
                    making it worthwhile to rebid. Other people were saying that we should just go
                    ahead, particularly the company that would have gotten the award. Birnbaum
                    decided in favor of rebidding it, and the new bids came in a million dollars
                    less.</p>
                <p>I also worked on a large telecommunications project that involved AT&amp;T.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was regional but I can't remember which countries it was in. I don't
                    recall any major issues other than it was chronically behind schedule. Maybe the
                    most interesting thing that I did was to get involved in sector loans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are sector loans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: A sector loan is different from a project loan in that it is a program
                    loan in the sense of either a cash grant or a commodity import program, but
                    directed at a particular sector and at achieving particular objectives in that
                    sector rather than at the economy as a whole. There was an interest in doing
                    them because project loans took so long to design and they took so long to
                    implement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I would say two to three years from the inception of the idea and the
                    presentation of the first project in the budget before it was approved and
                    before you had somebody on the ground to start to implement it. The host
                    countries didn't like that and the State Department didn't like that. Then it
                    would take another five to seven years to implement, generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it necessary to take that long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Given the agency's programming process, which is tied to the government
                    budget process, and given the Federal procurement regulations, there didn't seem
                    to be any easy way to shorten it. Everybody was frustrated by it and tried to
                    come up with ways, but I can't remember that there was any solution,
                    particularly for these large projects which did require a feasibility analysis.
                    A full scale feasibility analysis had to be done in stages for these big
                    projects. So we were looking for ways to transfer resources faster and as
                    effectively or even more effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the loan you were working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was in Ethiopia; an agricultural sector loan. I wrote the loan paper
                    for this, the first sector loan that the agency did. It was approved but it was
                    controversial. The old timers just didn't like this approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main features of the loan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was providing the agricultural sector with certain resources such as
                    fertilizer, equipment, and cash to start some rural loan programs. I can't
                    remember the specifics beyond that, but the idea was that we were doing it
                    because we regarded the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture as competent to use
                    this money productively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this for Ethiopia generally or for a particular
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: For Ethiopia generally. We developed it and negotiated it with the
                    government of Ethiopia. I'm not sure we were asking for too much to see how it
                    would work.</p>
                <p>Then having done that, I was, assigned to do another one for Tanzania, but I
                    recommended against doing that one because I didn't see any sign that the
                    Tanzania Ministry was capable of handling it. But the Mission found a way to do
                    what they wanted to do just by calling it a project support loan. There was very
                    little difference: just that we tied funding more specifically to the kinds of
                    equipment and supplies that went in and tied these to technical assistance
                    projects that we already doing. In that sense it worked.</p>
                <p>Eventually the Mission Director started talking to me again, after having
                    initially been very angry that I scuttled the sector loan.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other major loans? You were certainly
                        pioneering on sector loans, which have become more common these days. Were
                        there particular concepts then that are different from what we are doing
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't think so, the concepts are pretty much the same. I don't know
                    what they are doing now. I don't even know if they are doing sector lending
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably not as sector loans but as sector grants at any
                        rate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR : Right. I don't have the impression that the Agency has been doing that
                    in the last few years. I have been gone for five years. It seemed to me that
                    even during the 10 years or so before I left there wasn't much of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know how the one in Ethiopia worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The trouble is one keeps moving on. I think that there was an evaluation
                    done and the evaluation concluded that the loan had been reasonably
                    successful.</p>
                <p>The other major activity that I handled while I was in that job was brokering
                    negotiations between AID and several U.S. consulting firms for a multi-sector
                    loan in Ghana, four different sectors. Agriculture was one of them. I can't
                    remember offhand what the other ones were. Probably education as well. It was a
                    very important study. The Ghana government was paying over a million dollars for
                    it. It was very unusual to pay that much for a study, but they were trying to
                    come up with a development plan and this would be a major aspect of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that unusual for a loan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a loan, which would make it unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another pioneering effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, perhaps, I don't know. But it got done. There were a lot of issues.
                    Trying to help the Ghana government work it out. Why so many kinds of people
                    were needed. Why this needed to be paid for. Was the overhead rate reasonable
                    enough? Things you might expect a Contract Officer to do, but for some reason I
                    was doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SELLAR: It was '68 - 71 when I was in Africa CDF. I can't tell you the exact
                    year. Those were the highlights, I think, of that assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working in that unit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I enjoyed it and I felt that it was excellent experience. My boss was Al
                    Disdier. I liked him. He was supportive. We had our limitations sometimes, and
                    difficulties with other parts of the Agency in terms of things we wanted to do,
                    but we usually got them approved. The other loan officers were good; I learned
                    from them, particularly Bob Berg. They taught me how to do cost-benefit
                    analysis. I'd had a little bit of it in a course, not much. I liked the people I
                    was working with and felt we were a useful complement to what was going on in
                    the technical assistance side, which was not being handled by our office. There
                    was an office of technical support that handled the technical assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything about the Agency, working in it, that sticks out
                        in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Not particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened after your assignment there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Joined the USAID's Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation - 1971</p>
                <p>SELLAR: I went to what today would be a global office, the central office of
                    Private and Voluntary Cooperation. And you may ask why did I do that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this that you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: 1971. That was an unusual thing to do for someone who was a program and
                    projects officer because it was not regarded within the Agency as a mainstream
                    activity at all, and the people in there who were doing it were not regarded by
                    any means as being the cream of the cream in terms of agency talent. But quite
                    frankly the reason I did it was because I was offered a promotion and also
                    because I thought it would be a good time to be going in there because of the
                    whole New Directions movement, which I strongly believed in. It was clear that
                    there was going to be an opportunity to do more with development-oriented PVOs
                    than had been the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of the New Directions that was
                        taking place about that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It's funny, you know, I looked up Ted Owens' book Development
                    Reconsidered yesterday and discovered I hadn't read it. Nothing was marked up;
                    when I read something I always mark it up. I also discovered a small paper by
                    Jim Grant that appeared in one of these publications on bottom-up versus
                    top-down development - one of the themes associated with the New Directions. I
                    saw it as being a new development strategy, a definite change in the paradigm,
                    away from emphasis on capital formation and toward bottom-up as opposed to
                    top-down development, with the need for a lot of local collaboration in any
                    thing we do. The need for development of local capabilities in a more
                    decentralized manner, that's how I would sum it up. There's probably more to it.
                    I liked these new directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found that it was more appealing to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. There was more to be done particularly in terms of local
                    collaboration, involvement of people, than in the capital projects, which in
                    some cases were undoubtedly helpful but in other cases may not have been. We had
                    a project almost everywhere for the upgrading of an airport, for example.
                    Whether that was really because anybody worked out a development rationale in
                    terms of it being a priority area or was simply a way for getting people in and
                    out of the country safely was something I had my doubts about. Whereas the New
                    Directions focus seemed more broadly relevant to the priority development needs.
                    Also, I was just interested in a change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This office that you were assigned to, what was its
                        function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a central office. It was not even physically located in the State
                    Department as I recall; it was in Rosslyn. Its overall function really was to
                    serve as an interpreter between the U.S. private voluntary community and AID.
                    Try to explain each to each other and to try to help PVOs get approval for
                    funding of some activities. Of course, there was also all the humanitarian stuff
                    done in terms of ocean freight and PL 480. I guess ocean freight was what they
                    handled that had always been there for humanitarian activities. I was interested
                    in the developmental side. There was an opportunity, at that point, that really
                    had not existed before to start to help some of the developmental agencies get
                    some AID funding. The New Directions had sort of become a policy for
                    collaboration on local-level, bottom-up activities. Now the question was, what
                    are you going to do and how are you going to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the image you had of the PVO community at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SELLAR: That there were only a few agencies that had strong enough programs and
                    strong enough personnel capability that one could work with them
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Such as Save the Children, or CARE. Some of them, of course, didn't want
                    our money. I think it was the Mennonites that had quite a good program, but they
                    didn't touch US Government money. But most of the agencies were weak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Weak in terms of management and in terms of ability to track resources.
                    Weak in terms of ability to look at their programs in terms of whether they were
                    accomplishing anything or not. The evaluation and monitoring function was pretty
                    much absent. Because they were just doing good. Just to be doing it was good
                    enough. What we did was to develop a concept called the Development Program
                    Grant which was basically an institutional strengthening grant to these
                    organizations to enable them to improve their staff both quantitatively and
                    qualitatively. In terms of developmental thinking and improving their
                    capabilities to monitor and evaluate their programs, and to improve and
                    diversify their fund-raising sources. There was always a target of becoming, if
                    not totally self sustaining, at least more self sustaining so the AID grant
                    could be seen as ending at some point. So we developed this concept. I sa“we:” I
                    mean I had a hand in it. John Ulinski was Director of the office. I had worked
                    for him in Liberia, which was partly why I was hired.</p>
                <p>John Ulinski was a smart guy; and the Deputy Administrator, Harriet Crowley as
                    the Assistant Administrator, and after her Jerry Kiefer, were very eager to see
                    us do something with this new initiative. So, I had a lot of support from them.
                    I did two things: I worked on this concept globally and worked with agencies
                    globally, like Save the Children, the YMCA, Technoserve, and Africare. Those
                    were, in fact, four grants that I was instrumental in getting approved.
                    Initially, sort of launch them and get them off the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the grants designed to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SELLAR: They were designed to strengthen a particular agency's capability to
                    design its program more professionally and to monitor and evaluate it more
                    professionally. Implementation was usually something they could do all right,
                    sometimes not. But, it's these other areas that were weak. We also sought to
                    strengthen their capabilities to attract host country support and to have a
                    diversified fund raising plan. We worked with them on that. It helped in getting
                    the initial grants approved that I could talk to the Regional Bureaus. I'd been
                    in Regional Bureaus, and understood their language and their concerns, so I
                    could translate that back to PVOs. There were other people getting things
                    approved too, but I think I really did most of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the scale of these grants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, initially not big. I mean, we're in the late 1960s and '70s here,
                    so a million or two dollars would have been a good grant. Some of them were a
                    lot less than that. The initial grant to Technoserve was for only $75,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Usually they would get it for three to five years, just because that was
                    the way you got things approved. And, really the idea was also that since they
                    were new and experimental, there was no sense getting into something that ran
                    too long, if it turned out not to be successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the objective of the grant at the end? What were
                        you supposed to have accomplished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, specific objectives in terms of certain kinds of staff on board, an
                    evaluation system set up and functioning. In certain cases there was a program
                    expansion objective, i.e., to establish programs in six countries instead of
                    three. There was always a funding objective in the sense that they now would be
                    getting a greater percentage of their money, which we would define specifically,
                    from sources other than AID and whatever their current sources of funds were, so
                    they would be moving toward greater self-sufficiency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they? Were they able to carry on after the three to
                        five-year period or did they have to have more grants?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, most of them got grants beyond that period. That, in fact, was sort
                    of expected, because the initial grant was for such a short time frame that they
                    could only meet intermediate objectives. Save the Children was by far the most
                    successful. They really took the first grant and ran with it. Although initially
                    they had to move their Program Director to another job and bring in a different
                    person before they could get the grant approved, because the one they had was an
                    old time humanitarian-oriented fellow who couldn't conceptualize the new
                    emphasis on development. The head of Save the Children, David Guyer, recognized
                    that he wasn't getting anywhere and brought in a young fellow right out of a
                    Ph.D. program in management at Columbia, by the name of Charlie McCormack. When
                    he came on we were able to get something done and get it approved. They really
                    ran with the ball. Their program at that time was probably about five or six
                    million dollars a year. It's been growing ever since then and it's now over a
                    hundred and 10 million dollars a year. I think the quality of what they're doing
                    is far higher than it was then, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you really gave them a boost?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, yes. They made the most of it. The YMCA did not pan out. I mean, it
                    appeared to be a perfect organization to work with on this kind of a thing,
                    because they were decentralized. They had their local chapters everywhere; they
                    wanted to do things that were of interest and importance to the local community;
                    they could get guidance from New York on the program. That was the way we set it
                    up. Certain kinds of activities weren't agreed on between our criteria and
                    theirs. But it just never went anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain why one worked and the other didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it was the leadership of the organization. And, also the fact
                    that the YMCA priorities turned out really not to be as developmental as Save
                    the Children's. I mean, your typical YMCA, as you may well know, interacts with
                    its community in a symbiotic way, but primarily at the middle class level. Even
                    though I spent time with one of them in Nigeria and some other countries as part
                    of the program development process, taking a look at them, and it appeared that
                    they would be able to do things and were eager to do things; but it just didn't
                    happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe there was a philosophic difference between what you
                        were trying to do and what they...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, when I talked to the people in Nigeria, we talked about activities
                    that were consistent with AID priorities. But I think maybe it was the New York
                    personnel; they just weren't that effective; may have had many things on their
                    plate, perhaps. I just don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Africare as one you worked on. How did that
                        work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think that worked out pretty well. I think that they certainly worked
                    out well in terms of their being able to go on continuing to attract new funding
                    and then continue a program. How good the quality of their program is, I don't
                    know. Technoserve was the other one. That was an organization founded by Ed
                    Bullard, who in fact, had been a year ahead of me at Deerfield Academy. His
                    intentions were the noblest. Most of his support came from his church and
                    probably from his own pocket. His idea was technology benefitting mankind. But
                    the more he got into it, the more he realized that it wasn't technology so much
                    as it was business training. What he did was, his modus operandi was to work
                    with intermediate sized businesses in the countries where he saw it could work,
                    and in hopes that his assistance could greatly enlarge these companies so they
                    would become more profitable and hire more people. Job creation was really the
                    primary justification for us. So, we were trying to measure the employment
                    effect and we didn't find much. Some of the projects didn't work, some of them
                    did. Very few of them really blossomed into anything really major. Meanwhile,
                    they were applying very intensive assistance to these units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you understand why they didn't develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I can't give you a single answer to that, no. I don't think I was close
                    enough to the program in the field. I don't think I will even try to answer
                    that. It became pretty clear to me that it wasn't the most cost-effective model
                    for developing small business and that some of the other organizations like
                    Accion/AITEC and others, that were doing much smaller-sized funding with much
                    less hands-on technical assistance, seemed to be more cost effective. Perhaps,
                    doing training programs where whole groups of people were brought in was a
                    better way of doing it, and using some of the local development banks that were
                    credit unions or cooperatives. But Technoserve continues to this day, more or
                    less at the same level. Ed Bullard died of cancer, but he ran it for a long,
                    long time and it's still there. It finds enough interest in enough countries to
                    keep itself going.</p>
                <p>The other really interesting thing we did, in addition to the kinds of grants
                    that I have described, was to actually help the private sector create a brand
                    new organization, called Private Agencies Collaborating Together (PACT).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was created by your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: By our office. I was the Project Officer who worked on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the idea behind that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The idea was primarily to create an AID window in the private sector to
                    provide funds for all the development-oriented agencies that wanted funding for
                    their programs who were simply too small for us to deal with. And second, to
                    provide PACT with the capacity to provide the same kind of institutional
                    development assistance to these smaller agencies that AID was providing to the
                    larger ones. It was a way of wholesaling our assistance in addition to retailing
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too small being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Just not enough of a program or not enough of a capability for us to help
                    develop it without taking more time than our staff had. Heifer Project would be
                    one example. Partnership for Productivity was another. This was, of course,
                    innovative, too. It was the first time that AID had been able to give a grant to
                    an outside organization for subgrants to other organizations. And that raised
                    some eyebrows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite a pioneering initiative, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. There was some debate, but we were able to persuade people that it
                    was okay and, in fact, there was no law against it. There was a legal question
                    for a while, but finally we found the right lawyer who decided it wasn't a legal
                    question. We simply needed to develop the criteria that would be used in
                    approving projects, and the process that would be used. We jointly developed
                    these with the people in the private sector who were taking the time to work on
                    this. We got it worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This created a whole new organization then? Was there a
                        group outside that was pressing for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. There was a group outside that came to appreciate the
                    desirability of doing this, when they realized that they were never going to get
                    funding directly from AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. It was the interest of the small PVO group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. Although Catholic Relief Services (CRS), a large agency,
                    was also interested. The interested agencies put forth certain people as their
                    leaders and spokesmen. There was one man in particular, Bob O'Brien, who had
                    been a Jesuit priest originally, but had left the order. He had a PH.D. in
                    physics, and was a very personable guy who became their real leader in working
                    this up, and then became their first Executive Director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the scale of the subgrants? What kind of
                        subprojects are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, they were smaller. Anywhere I'd say from fifty thousand dollars to
                    two or three hundred thousand probably, in that range. The projects were in most
                    of the areas of AID technical assistance: agriculture, health, nutrition,
                    community development, small business development, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were very small.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. Again, it was experimental. I mean, we established our objectives,
                    but we didn't really know what would happen. But initially, PACT seemed to
                    succeed very well. Membership grew. We had about six organizations initially
                    that grew quite rapidly to 15 or 20 organizations. Not all of them, in fact,
                    received project funding, because that wasn't the only function of PACT. The
                    other function of PACT was to provide training to these organizations in terms
                    of the kinds of things we've been talking about. How they institutionalized the
                    program, not just run it forever; how to professionalize it in terms of
                    evaluating results and so forth. They did that. But, what has happened now, is
                    that PACT still exists today, but it has become a very different kind of
                    organization. It no longer makes grants. In fact, its objectives now, I believe,
                    as I recall, are more to work solely with indigenous voluntary agencies on
                    developing their capabilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it overseas or in the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then they can have a direct PVO type of operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, and that's fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're not an obvious lobbyist for the PVO community? I'm
                        not sure whether that's their role or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't think they are to any great extent. They may send somebody up on
                    the Hill from time to time, but I think the American Council for Voluntary
                    Foreign Assistance (ACVFA) is more important for that than PACT is. Because
                    apparently, as time went by, it became generally perceived that PACT wasn't a
                    substitute for AID funding, it was a competitor for AID funding. Some of their
                    member organizations, as they grew, got direct AID funding as well as PACT
                    funding. Then they saw PACT getting AID funding, which limited the pot for other
                    PVOs. Anyway, what I'm told is, that as time went by they began to view PACT
                    more as a competitor than as a resource. So that didn't work the way we expected
                    it would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They got something started, but then funding faded out and
                        they were not funded anymore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: PACT still gets AID funding for individual country programs and
                    activities. In fact, it is still heavily dependent on AID funding, but it comes
                    in a decentralized manner from individual countries rather than from a central
                    office. That was also not anticipated.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was fun doing this work, because it was on the cutting edge. If you
                    had any belief in the capabilities of PVOs to do good, professional work in the
                    field at all, which a lot of people didn't and a lot of people still don't, it
                    seemed like it was a worthwhile thing to be doing.</p>
                <p>I think more than a quarter of AID's budget now is supposed to be spent on PVOs.
                    So it's a very different environment today than it was then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of attitude did you see in the PVO community in
                        working with AID? How did they perceive AID and how did you perceive
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's an interesting question, because we, in fact, had a conference
                    with them, which led to the decision to try to create PACT, at which we had a
                    facilitator who was asking those kinds of questions with a piece of paper on one
                    wall saying, this is the way AID perceives PVOs, these are the adjectives that
                    AID uses to describe the PVO community. And a PVO piece of paper with PVO
                    adjectives regarding AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of those adjectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. AID was seen as being very big, very inscrutable, hard to penetrate,
                    arrogant, overbearing, but nevertheless trying to do something in development.
                    Not as people-oriented as the PVOs were. The AID attitude toward PVOs was that
                    they were small, weak, not very professional, and not delivering programs with
                    any major impact, but certainly with their hearts in the right place in terms of
                    what they were trying to do. I'm sure there's more, but that's all I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you sensed any real tension between the two
                        perspectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: There was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in the middle of it, I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, unfortunately, it was really John Ulinski who took the heat, not
                    me. In fact, I remember one unfortunate scene at the end of a big
                    conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I suppose it was '68, '69, sometime around there. Fairly early during my
                    stay there, because then we spent at least a full year, maybe two, developing
                    PACT after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other products beside PACT that grew out of
                        that conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, there were the usual mutual assurances of good will and general
                    assurances of willingness to work together. But the thing that I was going to
                    say that reflected the tension was that, after it was all over, one of the PVO
                    people looked John Ulinski in the eye and said, “Okay, John, now that we've gone
                    through this process, which was your idea, how about it? When do we get a
                    grant?” John came up with some carefully worded diplomatic reply, but it made
                    him very angry and I can remember him chewing out the poor Division Chief for
                    having allowed that situation to happen. The PVOs felt that AID was always
                    putting them through their paces, and that they weren't getting anything in
                    return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have an American Council of Voluntary Agencies
                        functioning at that time? What was that group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They did, but they weren't playing a role in this, strangely enough. I
                    think they were just doing what they traditionally did, registering
                    agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was their function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, that was one of their functions. That was their main function; some
                    kind of due diligence review of the agencies, and registering them. Maintain the
                    registry. And I think maybe they were the ones that implemented the ocean
                    freight. I'm not sure about that. And serve as a formal communications link
                    between the PVO world and AID, and of course, help out on the Hill as
                    needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with the Hill at all in this
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think we were, but not in any exceptional way. Only in the sense that
                    when we put our Congressional Presentation forward every year, it had these
                    things in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of attitude were you getting from the Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it was supportive. I can't recall that anybody was violently
                    against it, and I think some people thought that now we were moving in the right
                    direction. Very slowly, but they were interested in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on that experience? I think that's a very
                        interesting perspective, because that has blossomed into a huge relationship
                        in terms of the role of PVOs in development and AID resources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I'd just mention one other thing, and that's just because I'm proud of
                    it. I wrote a paper while I was there called, “Operation Pride,” a proposed
                    program for improved local level planning and execution of integrated rural
                    development. Integrated rural development was all the rage at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Everybody was having a hard time figuring out how to do it well. What I
                    did was basically suggest using community development organizations like Save
                    the Children, or others if there were any that were good, to sort of glue all
                    other technical agencies together at the local level. Obviously, government was
                    involved also. I mean, one could argue that one should have local government
                    gluing them all together, but in so many cases there really wasn't any local
                    government to speak of, and what existed was not very development oriented. So,
                    this paper was presented at the big conference we had with the PVOs at one
                    point. Not as an AID paper, but just as my personal think piece, along with
                    other materials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your thoughts about integrated rural development
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I thought it was extremely hard to do. Again, too much of it was
                    top down. It wasn't internalized at the local level. That was one of the main
                    reasons why it didn't work very well. It was extremely hard to orchestrate all
                    the different components of it, and therefore, for the most part it wasn't
                    working very well. So that's why I wrote this paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your paper was to propose what? What were you trying to
                        promote?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I was trying to promote a bottom-up form of rural development. It was
                    really based on local communities determining their own priorities and then
                    doing what they could themselves on the projects and calling in different
                    private agencies and/or government agencies, as needed, to provide
                    resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the PVO was supposed to be the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The glue, the centerpiece. I wouldn't have thought that any PVO could do
                    that, except that I was pretty impressed with what Save the Children was
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, not in any integrated sense. They were doing it in one way or
                    another, here or there with a particular agency or another particular agency,
                    more based on who was there and who they felt comfortable working with. But they
                    picked up my paper and ran with it, as with their DPG, and decided that it would
                    become their program model and used it as a central piece of their in
                    house-training program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Save the Children, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. I was credited by Charles McCormack with having basically provided
                    them with a model for their program. It lasted for about 20 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we need to see if we can't put this paper in as an
                        annex, because it's a seminal paper in this area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Fine. I would be glad to do that. I'm sure it's in the files of CDIE
                    somewhere.[See Annex A]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If it is not too long for the annexes, one is able to
                        spell out in more detail, a key philosophy and concept that got picked up.
                        Were they picked up by AID or within the agency? What happened there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I got a lot of positive feedback within the agency, but it was set
                    up to be implemented by the PVOs and I don't think anybody else would have
                    picked it up. Most of the other agencies were the kind that would fit within it,
                    in terms of doing small scale agriculture, health programs, training, whatever
                    it might be. But, an organization like SCF was the one that really logically
                    would be the coordinator. Africare might have done it; but SCF was really the
                    only one that picked it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was in 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1974, right in the beginning of the New Directions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did the agency pick it up in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No. It never became an agency paper. In fact, Ulinski was very nervous
                    about that, because he didn't even want AID shown on the cover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Because he wanted to make it clear that it was just one person's view as
                    to how things might work, and it wasn't something that big AID was dictating or
                    suggesting in a formal way to the PVOs. Otherwise, next year or in a few months
                    they might all be coming in with proposals to do this. I said it was a draft for
                    discussion and that opinions and recommendations made were by the author
                    alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's very interesting. Anything else on that
                        experience, which obviously has been a very rich time for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, I think that pretty well covers it, except that in addition to doing
                    the work centrally with PACT and these other agencies, I was also the Africa
                    Bureau liaison for the office. Each officer had a region with which he was the
                    liaison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in that function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, mostly traveled to a number of the Missions to look at what was
                    already going on in the way of PVO programs, and broker between PVO resources
                    and interests on the one hand and mission and host country needs and priorities
                    on the other hand, to promote the idea to Missions of doing more with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel in Africa then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. I got to go to quite a few countries doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the receptivity to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, everybody, of course was always polite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that suggests that you didn't get as good a
                        reception as you might hope for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it wasn't really fair to ask them to do anything specifically in
                    the way of approving something. I guess that would be where the rubber would hit
                    the road and you would be able to tell whether somebody really was receptive or
                    not. They were just polite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the environment for promoting PVO
                        activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Pretty good in most places. There were PVOs in virtually every country
                    that were doing things that were worthwhile, but they were doing them in a small
                    and often ineffective way. They needed institutional strengthening support to
                    enable them to do more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the issue that a lot of development
                        types say, well, it's all very nice to have PVOs and they do their little
                        things, but in terms of having an impact on development, it's too small,
                        it's just not sustainable, it doesn't grow, it doesn't whatever.... How do
                        you respond to all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I think that there's a lot of truth to that, but on the other hand,
                    we have a program like Accion that may seem small in any country, but, if
                    there's a number of different communities in that country and 20 other
                    countries, providing very small loans that are enabling people to get little
                    businesses going, then there is a cumulative effect that does happen in fact. I
                    think that the kinds of programs that Save the Children has been able to carry
                    out in the last 25 years definitely had some impact. Maybe hard to aggregate the
                    impact and, in many cases, they probably hadn't even tried to aggregate it. But
                    I think it's there. I don't think it's the whole story as far as development
                    needs are concerned, but I think it's part of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But part of that issue was how do you bring about a
                        multiplier effect, rather than just have an isolated activity. Were you able
                        to get some ideas about how that might be brought about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's what we were trying to do, basically in giving them the
                    wherewithal to expand, not only their activities, but also their capacity to
                    raise money to do more activities. And, in terms of sustainability, we made it
                    clear from the start that the AID grant would end, so they were going to have to
                    eventually be getting their funding from other sources and think about what
                    those sources might be. In this regard, the U.S. corporate community turned out
                    to be a big disappointment. PACT tried very hard to get meaningful support from
                    them as a coordinating agency, but didn't get much. Churches were already doing
                    a lot, but they often were more humanitarian oriented than developmental. So, it
                    was not an easy thing to resolve. I think you can argue as long as the idea's
                    around, it's okay to be providing long term support for some of these
                    organizations if they're proved to be effective, particularly if you can get
                    them to try to work themselves out of a job in terms of institutionalizing
                    themselves locally. Some of them really accept that idea now and many do
                    not.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I think that's what PACT has been doing. Most of them will say,
                    yes, yes, but, in fact, they really don't want to work themselves out of a job,
                    because they're getting their emotional gratification from doing good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: 1975. I was basically there for four years. It was time for me to move
                    on, but in fact, it took one of these agency-wide events to make that happen,
                    where they did a reclassification of all positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the Obey amendment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No. This was just a.., I can't remember if it had a particular name. It
                    was just basically a whole agency reclassification exercise. In terms not of
                    Foreign Service versus Civil Service positions, but in terms of grade
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of the Civil Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it was just the Civil Service. Yes, they do these either on the
                    Civil Service or on the Foreign Service side, I think. At that time, most of the
                    jobs in AID/Washington were still classified as GS jobs anyway. My job was
                    downgraded. I had been promoted while I was in the Office of Private and
                    Voluntary Cooperation to GS-15, which was frankly rather questionable, you know,
                    as to whether I should have been classified at that level. But they went out of
                    their way to get it done, because I was really getting a lot more done than most
                    of the people in there. They knew eventually that somebody would offer me
                    another job at a higher level. So, they did that, but in the reclassification
                    exercise my job was knocked down to a 14; and, in fact, the exercise was kind of
                    like a reduction in force (RIF). Everybody was then moved from one job into
                    another. Somebody who was more senior was moved into my job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I'm a little fuzzy on that. I think they did the reclassification, and,
                    then, they had a RIF. As a result of these two things, I was reassigned by the
                    Personnel Office to a different job, which was in the Office of Middle East
                    Affairs as it was called then. The title of the job was Special Deputy for Joint
                    Commissions. I really benefitted from these RIFs. I got bumped into better jobs
                    than the ones I'd been in, for part of my career, though that wasn't true at the
                    end. This job was coordinating U.S. government participation in seven different
                    Joint Commissions that had been established with Middle Eastern countries to
                    broaden and deepen our relationships. This was an outgrowth of the Camp David
                    accords, as a part of which special commissions were established with Egypt and
                    Israel, and the desire of a lot of other Middle Eastern countries to have it
                    demonstrated that we thought they were important too. It also happened in the
                    wake of the tremendous oil discoveries in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a Joint Commission for each country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. There were seven of them all together, all Middle Eastern
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which countries, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, I think Tunisia, Oman. Everybody wanted one. I
                    can't remember specifically, but I think the others were mostly the oil states,
                    as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Linked to the oil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, it was, and to help</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it include Israel and Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, the Israel and Egypt Commissions existed already. So, I guess if we
                    add them, then we're pretty close to seven. I don't think we had one with Syria,
                    although I could be wrong. The areas of activities included technology,
                    education, manpower training, cultural exchanges, agricultural development,
                    trade and industry, and general economic and financial relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the makeup of the commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it consisted of representatives from both sides, namely the U.S.
                    government on one side and the Commission country on the other side. The makeup
                    depended a great deal on what areas of joint interest there were to work on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Development focus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, in some cases, not in all cases. In some cases there was more on
                    developing trade and industry. But they were developmental in many cases. In
                    some cases, Egypt for example, it was really a classic development program and
                    the biggest one in the world, except it was run with Economic Support Funds (
                    ESF), originally called Security Supporting Assistance funds. Egypt was pretty
                    much purely developmental. Saudi Arabia was interesting, because they were
                    attempting to jumpstart their country, jump it out of whatever century it was in
                    (we used to say of Yemen that it was moving headlong out of the 12th century).
                    Saudi Arabia was probably further along than that, but they needed development
                    assistance. They had the money to pay for everything. Strangely enough, that
                    Commission wound up being run by the Treasury Department. I'm not quite sure why
                    that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a reimbursable aid program. Was that under the
                        Joint Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: In the case of Saudi Arabia it was, yes. I'm sure there were some
                    reimbursable aid programs that took place other than in Joint Commission
                    countries, but Saudi Arabia was really the first major instance where that
                    happened, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Commission's function to select programs: what
                        areas and how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, and then to actually help them procure the kinds of assistance they
                    needed help with procuring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who represented the U.S. on the Commission? What kind of
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: You'd have people from the Treasury; you'd have the AID person; you'd
                    have a State Department person; you'd have a Commerce Department person; and
                    then when you got into particular sectors, like agriculture, you'd have an AID
                    agricultural person or a USDA person. It really was an AID operation, except
                    that the Saudis were telling us what they wanted, because they were paying for
                    it, and they were paying overhead, as well. So, anything they wanted to do</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it all officials from the U.S. government? Were there
                        private sector representatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: There was a private sector component. In many cases you would have lots
                    of working groups under the official commission itself. I'm sure there were
                    working groups that involved the private sector, as well as government, because
                    they were building plants and getting into large agribusiness schemes. This
                    wasn't being run by the Saudis. The scope of the program was huge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It means that, in 1975, one activity cost as much as a billion dollars.
                    That was not the kind of money that AID was use to dealing with on a project. In
                    fact, I can remember a meeting that I went to with our engineers who were
                    grappling with something that the Saudis wanted done, and they had worked out a
                    tentative cost estimate. The meeting was with Bob Nooter, who at that point was
                    head of the Middle East Bureau. The engineers were sort of openmouthed about the
                    size and cost of this. Nooter, a cool customer said, “Hey, it's just a question
                    of adding zeros.” In fact, the initiation of that program saved an entire large
                    group of engineers that had been working on Vietnam from being put out on the
                    streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AID engineers were doing the work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: And a number of contract engineers. But, a lot of direct AID people were
                    involved who otherwise would have been surplus after Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who managed the Saudi Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The Treasury Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think because of the very large financial scope of the relationship.
                    Different agencies had the lead role in different Commissions, just depending on
                    what the main focus and objectives of the Commission were. AID was the head of
                    the Egypt Commission, while the State Department was the head of some, where it
                    was kind of a mixed bag of things that were wanted. Commerce may have been in
                    charge of some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Was there an overall coordination mechanism for the
                        Commissions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SELLAR: There was. That's what my job was, as far as AID was concerned, to keep
                    up with what was going on, and register AID inputs where appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In all the Commissions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. And interact, interface with the other agencies. You know, points of
                    view are not always identical between Treasury Department and AID, and State and
                    AID, or Commerce and AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, the ones other than Saudi Arabia were funded by AID
                        funds, rather than reimbursing AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was both. Egypt, of course, was fully funded by AID, but there were
                    others where, I think there was a mixture. I was only in the job for six months.
                    It was very political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of issues were you mainly having to deal
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it's hard for me to remember. Here's where I'd have to look at some
                    of my efficiency reports. I don't think there were any major issues that
                    couldn't get hashed out within the coordinating framework that we had. There
                    were issues of turf in some cases, you know, as to who ought to be running this
                    or that Commission. There were issues as to whether or not to establish a
                    Commission with a country, because many of them wanted them. The State
                    Department was happy to have everybody have one. We were more conservative about
                    that at AID, because we saw that leading to aid programs in countries that we
                    didn't want to go in to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think it was a good idea? Did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think so. I have never seen any overall evaluation of the Joint
                    Commission activity, but I know a lot of stuff got built and funded, and a lot
                    of people got trained and so on in Saudi Arabia. Agriculture was very expensive,
                    because they have these circular irrigation cranes, basically growing vegetables
                    in the desert. I don't know how economic that was. But, certainly there was a
                    tremendous amount of activity. Of course, the Egypt program. I don't know how to
                    characterize that.</p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I think they tended to wither away. I don't know whether they formally
                    still exist or not. I really can't say, because I was there for six months and
                    then assigned once again to another job when there was a RIF. So I never looked
                    back.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: In the same year, 1975. I was in that Joint Commission Coordinator job
                    for only six months and then there was a RIF. At that point, I think previously
                    it had been the classification exercise that moved me. In this case, it was the
                    RIF that moved me, because I was bumped by somebody who had more seniority, and
                    I in turn, bumped someone who was of a lower grade than I was, despite the
                    protest of the Latin America Bureau. This job was for some reason classified as
                    a GS-14 job, as the Assistant Director for Development of the Office of Central
                    American Affairs, which was a combined State-AID Office. It was a very
                    interesting situation for me, it was sort of a quantum leap forward in terms of
                    management and supervisory responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: More than anything I had done since Guinea. In Guinea, I was in charge of
                    half a dozen people in a diverse set of functions, but otherwise, I'd been
                    operating more as a Loan Officer and PVO Officer. So this was a leap forward in
                    the sense that I suddenly had four AID desks under me and four State Department
                    desks that responded to me in certain ways and certain situations. This was the
                    last remnant of the experiment that had been tried in the Latin American Bureau
                    earlier, of combining all the State and AID Regional Offices. This was the only
                    one that remained, and curiously, this was the only one that had ever been
                    headed by an AID Officer. I think the reason for this was that State wanted one
                    token AID Director and certainly the biggest thing going on in Central America
                    at that time was aid. Dave Lazar was the Director when I moved in. He stayed for
                    three months only and then went to another job and Mark Weissman came in to
                    replace him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that back-to-back kind of
                        relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I thought it was wonderful, because decisions got made so much
                    faster. I remembered the situation in the Africa Bureau in particular, where we
                    would write memos to each other and it would take weeks to reach a decision on
                    something, whereas we could do it in an hour in this office. It was very much
                    more efficient in that respect. Sure, you had differences in the perspectives of
                    the State Officers and the AID Officers, but that was minimized by having AID
                    Desks separate from State Desks. The joining of the two only occurred with me as
                    the number three person in the office and the Deputy Director, who was a State
                    person, and the Director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Central America when you joined
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, we were putting a good deal of money into it, but I don't recall
                    that there was anything really out of the ordinary. It was nothing like the
                    Central America issue that took place later, which I was also involved in later.
                    But, they were just poking along at different stages of development. Costa Rica
                    well ahead of the others and Honduras probably bringing up the rear; and
                    Guatemala with lots of problems with this sort of civil war going on in their
                    northern border and a lot of people disappearing, human rights problems there
                    and in other countries. Nicaragua having not gone communist at this point.
                    Somoza was there. They had had an earthquake, which had destroyed most of
                    Managua and there was a lot of effort being put into reconstruction of Managua.
                    The programs were broad, in terms of the sectors that we were involved in.
                    Pretty good sized programs, but nothing incredibly large; but I think that
                    region has always gotten more funding per capita, that area and the Caribbean,
                    than most parts oAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of issues did you have to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I spent a lot of time doing special assignments. I mean, I had ongoing
                    supervisory responsibilities for the AID Desks. Basically just the usual issues
                    of analyzing the program, deciding how much of it we wanted to support and then
                    going to bat for it up the line through the approval process. I remember I got
                    involved in and spent quite bit of time steering one PL 480 Title II Program to
                    the approval stage, getting that approved, which wasn't because I had any
                    particular background, but there were some issues in connection with the program
                    that I can't remember clearly that required somebody above and beyond the Desk
                    Officer to work on it, and I did that. I also spent a lot of time on a special
                    project that was a tripartite study with AID, the World Bank and IDB in doing
                    assessments of the agricultural and rural sectors, both regionally and in the
                    five individual countries. It was a big contract. Again, a lot of coordination
                    was needed with the other agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it supposed to be promoting regional cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was supposed to, both for regional cooperation and to identify those
                    things that it made sense to do regionally, but also to provide the basis for
                    knowing what the priorities were in the individual countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what came of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was an ambitious study. Well, it got done. I cannot tell you to what
                    extent it was truly internalized and used and helpful, because by then I had
                    moved on again. I was only in this job for six months. The reason for that was
                    that I had been a GS-15, but was bumped into a GS-14 job and only had a year to
                    find another GS-15 job, or in fact, I would have been demoted. And with a
                    resultant pay cut, which I didn't feel that I could take with a wife and two
                    children to support. So after about six months I was offered the job as Chief of
                    the Program Division in the Middle East Bureau, which was also the de facto
                    Deputy Director, because there was no Deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: For the Bureau, in the Office of Development Planning. That was a GS-15
                    position, so I took it. I did so somewhat reluctantly, because I not only liked
                    the Central America office, but I also liked Latin America. I'd never been in
                    Latin America previously; never took Spanish in school, always took French,
                    although I did manage to get myself to school for seven weeks in full time
                    Spanish, at AID, because there was a period of time before the person I was
                    bumping could be reassigned. So, they said, “well, we really don't know what to
                    do with you until she's gone.”, so I suggested language training until they
                    needed me. In fact, they were appealing the personnel action, although they
                    didn't tell me that. But the appeal was denied, and seven weeks later the bumpee
                    got herself moved to another office so I had to be yanked out of language school
                    and put to work. It was a Washington job, not a field job. Just kind of an ad
                    hoc arrangement for me to go do language training, which was great. I got to the
                    one, one plus level, because with all the French I had had, Spanish was not that
                    hard, but I didn't have enough time to really learn it well.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>You were asking me about what particular issues I got involved in. Another thing
                    they asked me to do was an ad hoc assignment. It couldn't be done by a Desk
                    Officer, and Marv Weissman couldn't take the time to do it. They had a Central
                    America Mission Directors Conference in Central America. They decided, maybe a
                    couple of weeks before the conference, that they ought to have a draft regional
                    strategy paper, so they asked me to write that. This wasn't quite as bad as
                    being asked to do an agency communications policy the week after I arrived, but
                    it was challenging. But I'd been there nearly six months, and I'd been through
                    the whole region, so I was able to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You traveled through the region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, they sent me on a backbreaking trip through the whole region,
                    because Lazar said that if I only went to a few countries the others would be
                    insulted. So I had to go to them all in one trip. By the time I got to the sixth
                    one, I wasn't sure which one I was in. It was one of those trips, but still, it
                    did expose me to programs in the region and gave me some idea of the differences
                    and similarities in countries and what the priorities were, so I was able to put
                    together a draft strategy that everybody thought was pretty good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a regional strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a draft regional strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a ROCAP at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, ROCAP was part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have a role in preparing the strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, other than to comment on what I was doing, because it had to be done
                    so quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the point of having it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Something for the Mission Directors to chew on. Something for them to
                    begin to think about, perhaps in terms of dealing with the role of ROCAP versus
                    the bilateral missions, which was always...</p>

                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what you were trying to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No. I don't know if I even have a copy of it. I could look it over if I
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there have been others who've talked about Central
                        American economic integration and ROCAP and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't think I even have a copy of it here. I may have it somewhere. I
                    don't think it was really a significant contribution to those kinds of issues,
                    because it was necessarily a fairly superficial paper and because I hadn't been
                    steeped in the region long enough to really fully understand all the issues
                    between ROCAP and the bilateral missions and their respective roles. I mean, I
                    had some idea and I'm sure there was some reference to it in the paper, but
                    nothing in depth and it certainly didn't solve the problem, which continued
                    on.</p>
                <p>There's one thing, actually about the Latin American and Central American job,
                    which I had forgotten about. You asked me about ROCAP and the relationship to
                    the bilateral programs in terms of strategy and programs, and until I looked
                    through my notes since our first meeting, I had totally forgotten that there
                    actually was a strategy exercise at ROCAP to try to rationalize this and I went
                    down and participated in it at the request of the Mission. I can't recall
                    exactly what came out of it, but I know these exercises were periodic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues with ROCAP?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, really what would ROCAP do versus what would the Missions do.
                    Problems of communication between ROCAP and all of the bilaterals. I think those
                    were the main issues. The bilaterals, of course, would sometimes question the
                    need for a ROCAP at all, but there were certain kinds of regional activities
                    that it did make sense to handle regionally. The regional program could have
                    been done out of Washington, but I think it was better to have it in the field
                    where people working on it could talk to their counterparts in the regional
                    institutions more frequently. That would not have been the case if they had
                    worked out of Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, after your Latin American experience you went

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I went to Near East DP and that was not because I wanted to, because I
                    really liked Latin America and the Latin American Bureau and would have liked to
                    have stayed, but I was in the situation where I had to move back into a GS-15
                    job within one year or lose the grade and lose the pay. Brad Langmaid offered me
                    the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Head oDP at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. He offered me the job of Program Chief, which was also de facto
                    Deputy, because he didn't have a Deputy. What I did was supervise on a daily
                    basis about four program analysts and two budget analysts in reviewing and
                    recommending disposition of projects and programs from 15 Middle Eastern, North
                    African and European countries. The total budget was over two billion dollars.
                    In time I also supervised the Bureau Controller when the Controller's functions
                    were decentralized to some extent to the Regional Bureaus. And, somewhat
                    unusually, I thereby had responsibility for analyzing operating expenses as well
                    as program funds. And also staffing levels as well as program budgets, which was
                    unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a big program to be reviewing and overseeing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it was certainly big in terms of the money. The fact is, many of
                    them were rather small in terms of numbers of activities. Egypt, however, was
                    huge and kept getting bigger and bigger. So, averaging those out, I guess you
                    would say, yes it was a pretty big program. Spain, for example, was just
                    basically a military base payment, and for Israel we just wrote them a check
                    that accounted for a lot of money, but didn't require any programming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of issues were you having to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, we had continuing issues with the State Department about the level
                    of the ESF/SSA Programs. Originally, they'd been called Security Supporting
                    Assistance. By now, I think they were called Economic Support Fund, which was a
                    more indirect way of saying, politically motivated programs. There were two
                    programming processes, AID's and State's. Most AID Bureaus had very little
                    contact with the State process, nor did AID's Central Office of Policy and
                    Program Coordination (PPC), because the ESF money was almost entirely, at that
                    time, within the Near East Bureau. So we sort of had to discover how that
                    programming process worked and how to interact with it. That was the way we
                    often argued for different ESF levels than the State Department was arguing for.
                    In any case, Egypt and Israel were sort of sacrosanct. Those levels were pretty
                    well set. But, in many cases, we were able to influence the levels going into
                    some of the other countries, and we saw that as our job to try to hold those
                    down, because to the extent those levels were held down, there would be more
                    money for development assistance. Not necessarily in our Bureau, but worldwide.
                    We sort of felt an obligation to the Agency to try to do that. I can remember
                    one example that sticks in my mind where I got our Desk Officer, who was also an
                    economist, to go to a meeting along the chain of what was called the SAPRWG
                    process.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Security Assistance Program Working Group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. That was State and AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That was the State process. He was able to actually persuade them that
                    Turkey needed 50 million dollars less than they were proposing. So that was a
                    good day for AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what grounds you based it on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I can't remember the specific issues. Just that he had a different
                    picture of the economy than they did and then argued that they didn't need that
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An economic balance of payments kind of analysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about, did you make any dent in the Egypt/Israel
                        levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, no. We couldn't do that. Didn't even try. It was pretty well set by
                    the Camp David Accords. So, the question there really was to try to use the
                    money as effectively as possible in Egypt. As Langmaid liked to say, Egypt was
                    the largest development assistance program in the world, because even though it
                    was funded with ESF money, Egypt was an underdeveloped country and needed all
                    the same kinds of help that you typically found in a less developed country.
                    But, it was unusual in AID at that point to have so much money to work with. So
                    we had engineers out there and lots of loan officers doing capital projects, on
                    a grant basis, but nevertheless, capital projects that had pretty well died out
                    in the rest of the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any understanding of how those levels were
                        originally arrived at and then became fixed in concrete?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How we ever got to that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I do not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder. All right. Well, were you able to influence the
                        allocations of these funds as to what they were used for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Oh, yes. The interesting thing about State was that they were, I would
                    say, about 98 percent concerned about the level and very little concerned about
                    the content. Once the levels were established, they pretty much left it up to us
                    to determine what to do within those levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you see that process working, the process of
                        deciding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That was done within the AID programming process in the same way that it
                    was done worldwide. Annual program submissions would come in. They would be
                    vetted by my Office, the Desk and others. Based on inputs from everybody who
                    looked at it, we would then develop an issues paper, then have a meeting with
                    the Mission Director. The Bureau would make up its mind what it was going to
                    recommend and then go forward to PPC.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have particular issues or recurrent issues about
                        allocations toward particular sectors or types of projects? What kind of
                        issues were you raising?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't think we had any highly significant differences in perceptions
                    from the Mission. For one thing, Egypt blew up so quickly and so few people
                    really knew anything about Egypt that it wasn't anything that most of us were
                    able to bring much background to, so we relied heavily on consultant reports,
                    feasibility studies. In a way, there was enough money to do everything, so it
                    wasn't like a resource-scarce AID program where you really had to make decisions
                    between the sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, there were issues about, I guess, drawing down the
                        funds once committed to projects? Did you have issues and things of that
                        sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Oh, yes. But, those were no more severe in Egypt than anywhere else. I
                    mean, once the Mission got built up, initially the problem was finding ways to
                    authorize the money every year. I remember, in fact, the AID Representative when
                    all this began was a fellow by the name oBill Templeton, a very nice guy. I'd
                    known him in AID Washington. He invited me out to try to help formulate the
                    initial strategy for Egypt and I had six days to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what you were trying to do in your
                        strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No. All I remember is going into lots of empty offices where there were
                    stacks of feasibility studies in the corner, because no furniture had arrived
                    yet and no people had arrived to occupy the offices or read the studies. This
                    was very early.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I suppose this was probably '76, '77. Bill told me that he use to dread
                    to go to work in the morning, because he would go into work and discover that
                    Washington had given him another 50 million dollars which needed to be
                    programmed by the end of the year, and he had no idea how he was going to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it mostly project aid or did you use commodity import
                        programs, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a combination. That was certainly one of the issues between us and
                    the Egyptian government, as to how much of it would be balance of payments
                    support and how much would be projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they pushing for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They wanted more of the balance of payments support and less of the
                    projects. We thought that they needed more projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular thrust of the program that you remember
                        that stood out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I think it was a pretty balanced program. Again, we were doing
                    something in virtually every sector. Major education programs; major
                    agricultural and rural development programs in the Delta. Big projects to build
                    roads and rehabilitate roads and do something about congestion in Cairo. Low
                    cost housing programs. Health programs, family planning programs. I mean, you
                    name it and we were doing a lot of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any time working with the Egyptian
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I personally did not, except during this one visit when I met some of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sense of the rapport or the issues they were
                        experiencing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think the rapport was pretty good. Politically, the rapport was
                    excellent. The Ministers were probably better educated and more competent than
                    the ones we would be working within most countries. They definitely had their
                    ideas as to what they wanted and how they wanted to do things. The problem was
                    below the Ministerial level. You very rapidly ran into nothing, even though
                    there were a lot of people sitting at desks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about some of the other countries that you were
                        concerned within that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Actually, we had a couple of development assistance countries. I tended
                    to concentrate on those. This is the way Langmaid wanted to do it. Initially, we
                    had a very split, sort of schizophrenic situation in the office. Because with
                    the Development Assistance countries, we had to take our tin cup and go begging
                    to PPC for money and fight very hard for whatever money we could get, because
                    the host countries were relatively advanced with the exception of Yemen. The
                    advanced ones were Morocco and especially Tunisia. I think those were the only
                    three. The rest of the program was ESF funded and there was never a question of
                    getting enough money, it was just a question of, in fact, trying to hold the
                    levels down, as I mentioned before. So Brad took that part. He gave me the hard
                    part, the tin cup detail. But it made sense, because the ESF Programs were, of
                    course, the most important. Yet the Development Assistance programs required a
                    lot of time, because you had to have a totally separate budget and do all the
                    same things in terms of programs and missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Development Assistance countries that you
                        were working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen. Yemen was a fascinating situation. I spent a
                    good deal of time on it, because its needs were so great. It was sort of rushing
                    headlong out of the fourteenth century, as people put it. It had been completely
                    closed to the outside world for a long time and it had only recently opened up
                    and allowed foreigners in and decided that it wanted to develop. So they needed
                    everything, but we didn't have the budget to do everything there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of program do you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was pretty heavily concentrated in agriculture and agricultural
                    education. Some general education and training, participant training programs,
                    as well. Also, there was an effort to stimulate the private sector. In fact, the
                    Mission Director invited me out to put together a sector strategy for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a private sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: There was, but there wasn't much of one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of strategy were you trying to suggest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, to be honest with you, I don't really remember much of the details.
                    One thing that was notable about the private sector was the way egg operations
                    sprung up everywhere. Egg farms, chicken farms. Once we provided them with some
                    technical and managerial knowhow, they sprang up, so that gave you a clue that
                    the Yemeni were inherently entrepreneurial and something could be done if you
                    could eliminate the barriers. I think, as I recall, that it came down to the
                    kind of customary problems of no laws on the books that would facilitate private
                    enterprise and make contracts mean anything. No training facilities for people
                    to learn business management. So those needed to be taken care of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in a situation where, for example, no laws
                        on the book. Were we involved in trying to do something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We would offer to help them, and draft the legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we did that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Sure, yes, we did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they had a system for applying the legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, the next problem, of course, was enforcement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not necessarily the custom to proceed that way, I
                        guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Right. Extremely tribal country. The Northern tribes regarded themselves
                    as being a law unto themselves, which in fact they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there more aspects of the Yemen program that you had
                        to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The only other thing I really remember is spending an awful lot of time
                    working on the Title XII consortium of U.S. agricultural universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, they had a very large Title XII program there. It was kind of out
                    of control really.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a Title XII program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a consortium of U.S. agricultural land grant universities.
                    Legislation had been passed by Congress to encourage us to do things under that
                    title. It met resistance in a number of AID countries, but in Yemen it seemed
                    like a natural, because they just had nothing. So they were trying to start a
                    university there, among other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consortium, do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I can't remember the individual members, except that there were a lot of
                    them. They were also doing everything: extension, research, starting the

                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, neither we nor they really knew how much money they were spending,
                    for example, in local currency, and what it was going for. So, I straightened
                    that out. The Mission sent me a letter of commendation. Forced them to just keep
                    books that would enable us to tell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was local currency spent by their contract money or
                        was it local currency generated through other programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: My recollection is that it was local currency generated through other
                    programs, which was assigned to this project. There were other programs going on
                    that generated local currency - a big PL 480 Title II program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they get the university established?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They did, they did. How the research and extension turned out, I'm not
                    sure. We had a problem, for one thing, with competing with the World Bank for
                    personnel, because the Bank was out there doing a lot, too. Their favorite
                    technique was to set up a special authority, which wasn't subject to Civil
                    Service regulations, and then take anybody they wanted in the country, because
                    they could pay them more. That was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what the name was for that university? Do you
                        remember what it was called?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, the Agricultural College of Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it still going as far as you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I really don't know, but I would expect that it is. I know there's been
                    some political turmoil in the region, a question of North and South Yemen
                    unifying and then splitting apart again. But agriculture is absolutely basic to
                    that economy, so I would imagine it is still going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the other developments in other
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The others were much more developed than Yemen. We've already spoken
                    about Tunisia a little bit. They were always on the verge of being graduated,
                    and we were always having to defend the continued existence of the program. I
                    promoted phaseout internally, but then when I was overruled, I would go forth
                    and defend continuing it up the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What argument were you making to discontinue the
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Just that the money was needed elsewhere much more urgently, and what we
                    were doing there was not all that important in terms of Tunisia's overall
                    economy. We also often had difficulty with programs for lack of French-speaking
                    personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular focus of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Again, a good deal of it was concerned with agriculture. We also helped
                    with some planning assistance in the tourism sector, which appeared to be one of
                    their most promising avenues. I think they discovered a little bed of oil at one
                    point, which again, gave them a boost and made the continuation of the program
                    more questionable.</p>
                <p>Morocco was an interesting country. Great contrasts between the wealthy few and
                    the mostly poor many. Great contrasts between the pretty sophisticated urban
                    areas and the very undeveloped rural areas, particularly up in the mountains.
                    But they had good farm land along the coast. I know we were working with them on
                    wheat production and livestock. I can't remember too many of the specifics
                    beyond that. There was PL 480 Title II, nutrition and health education and
                    family planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a political rationale program there at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SELLAR: No. That was a development (DA) program. It was justifiable
                    developmentally. Overall per capita income was sort of intermediate. It wasn't
                    tremendously low, but it wasn't nearly as high as Tunisia or Costa Rica or some
                    of the other advanced developing countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your work in the Near Eastern Bureau? It
                        was quite a difference from working in Latin America, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. I liked it in many ways. I found it very challenging. We were very
                    busy, particularly because of Egypt. I didn't feel uncomfortable with my
                    function since being a Program Officer was basically what I had been, and it was
                    just a question of going back and doing that again in a much bigger program. The
                    ESF aspect was different, and was bothersome at times in terms of levels, but I
                    enjoyed the interaction with the State Department on that. In fact, one of my
                    tasks was to go to the Assistant Secretary's morning staff meeting, which they
                    held four mornings a week, and just be the AID person at that meeting in case
                    there was anything to talk about. Mostly, I just listened and reported back to
                    my superiors if there was anything that seemed significant. It was sort of fun,
                    kind of sitting in the cockpit of history, if you will, since it was a period of
                    major involvement in the Middle East. I think that our budget represented
                    something like half or two-thirds of the Agency's budget. It was also
                    challenging at times to serve as Acting Director. At these times I had to
                    supervise the Economics Unit and the Evaluation Unit, as well, which were the
                    other two units in the office. I had my ups and downs in the office in terms of
                    perceptions of my performance, and I stayed too long. I was there for nine
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nine years. That's a long time isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, too long. But, the Obey amendment came along during those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the intent of the Obey amendment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: As I understand it, the intent was to remedy an imbalance that had
                    existed between GS and Foreign Service employees and remedy a situation where
                    Foreign Service employees would have very responsible jobs in the field and then
                    come back for a Washington assignment and be put into a much less responsible
                    job, because all of the jobs in Washington were held by GS employees. They were
                    designated as Civil Service jobs, and people would just kind of stay there and
                    rise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't rotate like the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. So there wasn't much room at the top. The Obey amendment
                    overcame that by enabling AID to designate virtually all of their jobs in
                    Washington as Foreign Service positions. It went even further and said that
                    Foreign Service Officers could occupy GS positions, but not the reverse. GS
                    persons couldn't occupy Foreign Service positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So certain positions were designated Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Virtually all of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of them. All of the senior ones, I guess you're
                        talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: At all levels. I mean, not the jobs in the support offices: the
                    Contracting Office, the Controller's Office; but the program jobs certainly
                    were. One exception was the Deputy DP Director jobs, which were kept as Civil
                    Service. The rationale for that was that you needed continuity somewhere in the
                    Bureaus and that was a good place to provide it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That affected you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That affected me, because I was in that job. Yet suddenly it became
                    extremely difficult to find any other job. Even if one indicated a willingness
                    to go overseas. In other words, to convert to Foreign Service. It was extremely
                    hard, because the claim was that Program Officer positions were always in
                    surplus and therefore, they couldn't convert you or wouldn't convert you. You
                    just weren't put into the rotation. You had to apply for the Foreign Service,
                    basically as if you'd come in off the street, irrespective of however much
                    experience you might have had, or as in my case, irrespective of the fact that I
                    had already been in the Foreign Service at one point. The restrictions were very
                    heavy. I think, frankly, it was a discriminatory application of the Obey
                    amendment. The pendulum had swung too far, as so often is the case. There was a
                    fair middle ground somewhere. Previously, it had been much too much in favor of
                    GS, because after all, AID is a Foreign Service Agency. But it swung so far that
                    it really did become discriminatory against civil servants. So I was sort of
                    locked in concrete for that reason in Near East DP. The first five years or so
                    were fine. I enjoyed working with Brad Langmaid, working for him. He was a
                    graduate school classmate of mine. I didn't know him very well in graduate
                    school, but he was very able and handled the staff very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there significant changes in the circumstance and
                        environment over those nine years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't recall any major ones, except for the Obey amendment and then at
                    the end, the basically hostile takeover of the Near East Bureau by the Asia
                    Bureau. That's what eventually knocked the concrete off my feet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't think it was so much a plan as it was a general tightening up. Of
                    course, there were always tightening ups and so forth, but in this case, I
                    really think it was because we had a clearly incompetent Assistant Administrator
                    who for political reasons couldn't be fired. Also, during this period Brad
                    Langmaid moved up to be the Deputy Assistant Administrator and he ran the Bureau
                    and he was fine, except he was a little overcontrolling in terms of field
                    programs. At least that was the perception. So the Egypt Mission was out to get
                    him and others may have been out to get him. And there was a movement, in fact,
                    toward decentralization of authority to the field, which was needed. Langmaid
                    was moved into a Central Bureau and never came back to a Regional Bureau. The
                    joke was that the Assistant Administrator was fired for being incompetent and
                    Langmaid was fired for being too competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were these roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: This was toward the end of the period, as I recall, in the early '80s.
                    The first major move toward decentralization, I think, was made by the Asia
                    Bureau. It was called the Asia Bureau Experiment. That then became quite
                    quickly, really without waiting to see if it worked in Asia, the new Agency
                    model. Under that model Washington, which previously had reviewed project papers
                    too often, could barely review them at all. We had three project approval
                    stages, as you remember, for a long time. First we would review a Project
                    Identification Document (PID), just a one-page sketch of what the project would
                    be, as part of the overall program submission. Then, if authorized to proceed,
                    the Mission would do something called a PRP, which I think was a Project Review
                    Paper (PRP). Then, if that passed muster, they were authorized to do a
                    full-fledged project paper (PP). So that was three times that the Missions had
                    to come to Washington for approval. There were also other areas where they felt
                    they were over controlled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about that procedure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I thought that there needed to be some decentralization. I didn't have
                    any problem with eliminating the intermediate stage, i.e. not seeing PRP's.
                    Eliminating those was one of the first steps taken by Bob Nooter when he became
                    Deputy Administrator. But, I think they went too far delegating project approval
                    to the field, with the exception of Egypt, because those Missions didn't really
                    have the accumulated knowledge and expertise that you could find in Washington.
                    What really needed to be done was to delegate implementation authority to the
                    field, in my view, not project approval authority, and that wasn't done, because
                    the Contract Officers and the Controller's Office remained central, even though
                    a Mission would have Contracting Officers. The Missions may have had some
                    authority. Usually they had Controllers in the Mission, but they were controlled
                    from a Central Office in Washington. The impression I had is that implementation
                    authority was never delegated to the same extent that approval authority was. I
                    would have liked to continued to have seen project papers from Egypt. Once they
                    got PID approval that was it. They could do the project design themselves. Also,
                    at the PID stage, once the PRP was gone, you could decide to delegate authority
                    to the Mission to approve the PP. It was up to the Assistant Administrator or
                    whoever was chairing the review to make that decision. There was a lot of
                    pressure on them to use that authority to the maximum, even though in some cases
                    I don't think it was justified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They did. Though not always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the basis for not doing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. Actually there were even written criteria. One of them was that if
                    it was a particularly sensitive project politically, then there might be
                    political ramifications that would be understood better in Washington than in
                    the field. Another one was if it was a particularly complex project that might
                    require some Washington expertise. And anything that was really breaking new
                    ground in terms of something that the agency hadn't done before, would likely be
                    reviewed in Washington. The grounds were, in that case, that we were going to
                    have to explain it to Congress, so we needed to know about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know of an example of a project in that
                        category?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Oh Lord, that's hard. I can't remember very many specific examples. I
                    remember one Latin American project that was an environmental project that was
                    very ambitious; there were all sorts of components in it and it involved a lot
                    of money. If a project was a very large project in relation to the portfolio in
                    the program, I think that would also be grounds sometimes for bringing it back
                    to Washington. So we asked to see that one.</p>

                <p>SELLAR: Frankly, at this point it's hard to think of any others.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the new program interests or concerns that were
                        being introduced that you had to cope with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think that environmental concerns were making progress during that
                    period and we were doing a lot more environmental stuff by the end of this
                    period than at the beginning. Initially, that was quite controversial.
                    Economists tended to feel that would be uneconomic and might slow down the
                    growth that we would otherwise achieve. However, the pressure for it was so
                    strong; everybody else thought it was something that really needed to be dealt
                    with, including people on the Hill. Again, there was a legislative mandate that
                    we should do a certain amount. Most of us felt that we really should.</p>

                        your work in that position? You were in a heavily process-oriented role in
                        that position, moving project papers, which doesn't always seem so eventful,
                        but is a major part of the businesHow did you feel about the process that
                        you were having to go through? You've talked about various things.
                        Overall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it's too bad that we had to get funding authorization every year,
                    which by the way I understand has not changed. I mean, every year we had to
                    testify in detail before at least four committees for authorization and
                    appropriation on the House and on the Senate sides. And, very often ad hoc
                    special committees were also set up on one thing or another. Our job was to
                    develop the briefing books that would support the Assistant Administrator or
                    Deputy who was testifying. An enormous amount of time and effort went into that.
                    Much too much. I think that's pretty well understood. I remember Hubert Humphrey
                    when he was alive, who was one of our sympathizers and supporters, came out one
                    time with a stack of books about three feet high and said, this is what AID has
                    to submit every year, I don't know how they have time to do any work. But, it
                    was hard to streamline the Congressional submission, to get Congress to agree to
                    streamline it, because it wasn't a popular program, and they needed to be able
                    to tell our constituents that they'd reviewed every dollar. There was also a
                    heavy load on doing Congressional Notifications which had to be sent up to the
                    Hill constantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. What was that requirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, basically if the project changed significantly in scope; if it
                    became significantly modified and required extensions; if the costs rose
                    considerably beyond what you had projected initially and presented to Congress
                    initially, you would send up a Notification. Even if the total funding level had
                    not changed, but the obligation amount within a given year was beyond what you
                    had presented for that year, you would have to send up a one-page piece of paper
                    to Congress describing the project again and justifying the change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many objections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Not too many, but we had a huge number oNotifications that had to go up.
                    Every now and then you would draw an objection. So, my job was to try to write
                    the thing so well that they would just go down smoothly, and not draw
                    objections. We were pretty successful with that, particularly with the ESF
                    Programs, which Congress didn't scrutinize us closely as the DA. But it created
                    a lot of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any type of objections or issues that they
                        would raise, particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They got into all sorts of issues. Sometimes it was policy based.
                    Sometimes they were good questions. I can't really remember any specifics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no pattern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, there were patterns at times, but I honestly can't tell you what
                    they were. This was one aspect, though, of my being on the job for too long,
                    because I paid very careful attention to these. At one time the Agency guidance
                    had been very good on how to do them and I'd been involved in writing that. But,
                    as time went by, it sort of slipped, and the guidance inadvertently changed and
                    wasn't as good as it had been. I sort of held up to the original standards and
                    made everybody rewrite certain sections of these things and made myself very
                    unpopular in the process. I thought I was just upholding standards, but others
                    viewed it as my being a rigid guy who was more concerned with paperwork than
                    with running the program. So I was criticized for that toward the end. Probably
                    justifiably so. I should have been more flexible in just going with the revised
                    guidance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember how often you got objections from the
                        Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Not really that often. If I could have demonstrated that the quality of
                    our notifications held the objections down, there might have been a better
                    argument on my side, but in fact you couldn't demonstrate it.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Oh, I want to mention that I had some good training along the way. We've been
                    just talking about my jobs.</p>
                <p>Opportunities for training and field evaluations</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. What kind of training programs did you attend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: During the Near East job, when I was still considered to be executive
                    potential, i.e. for moving up from the GS-15 job that I was in to the Senior
                    Executive Service, I got to go to a management course at the Federal Executive
                    Institute for three weeks. I found that very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the Institute focus on in that course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it was sort of an unusual course. It was run by psychologists,
                    primarily. It had more to do with stress management and getting balance into
                    your life, and effective time management, rather than management theories. Then,
                    in addition to that course, back in 1969, long before I got to DP, I was able to
                    take the intensive six-month economics course that they gave at the Foreign
                    Service Institute, which was primarily intended for Foreign Service Officers to
                    turn them into Economic Officers. Why they just didn't hire people with a
                    background in economics, I don't know. They took one AID Officer every year into
                    the course, and I got to go one year. That was very valuable for me, because,
                    although I had had some economics in graduate school, a lot of it went in one
                    ear and out the other, because I had had no basic grounding in it; the
                    assumption was that you'd had basic economics, which I hadn't had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: This course was excellent for me, because it didn't assume that you'd had
                    any basic economics, so it began at the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very intensive, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was. It was six months of total immersion. They claimed that it was
                    the equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree, just on the basis of the scores that
                    people achieved at the end of the course on the graduate record exams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It covered all aspects of basic economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SELLAR: It did, and it had a section on economic development, which was actually
                    the worst section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The worst section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, it was terrible. So bad, in fact, that the teacher who gave it, who
                    was also the coordinator of the whole course, never gave it again. They went out
                    and found somebody else. It was just divorced from reality. Even the Foreign
                    Service Officers knew that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not well informed, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Just overly academic, not dealing with real-world issues. But, apart from
                    that it was an excellent course. I felt much more confident and comfortable the
                    rest of my career in AID having had that. Not that it turned me into an
                    economist, but I at least became familiar with the concepts, was able to work
                    with them, and knew the vocabulary.</p>
                <p>The other course that I took, which was during my stint in the Near East Bureau
                    in 1980, was a 12-week development studies course. This was an in-service course
                    to basically broaden peoples' perspectives on development, especially narrow
                    technicians. They brought in one very liberal political scientist and one
                    anthropologist to teach that. So it was pretty interesting, because in many ways
                    the course was sort of anti-development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other aspects to the course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, the anthropologists were very concerned that we never make an
                    intervention until we understood that it wasn't going to destroy something,
                    rather than help it, or destroy something somewhere else that we hadn't thought
                    about. And, of course, many of our interventions and many of the World Bank
                    interventions did that. They had lots of literature on examples of this -
                    cautionary tales - which presumably helped us become aware of things to watch
                    out for. The problem was, they didn't provide you with any suggestions on
                    alternative approaches. The conclusion seemed to be that maybe it was better
                    just not to do anything. This was not operationally practical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. But did it increase your receptivity to local
                        cultures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. And gave me a chance to do some reading, that otherwise I never
                    would have done.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular development theory or concept
                        that they were promoting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I don't know that there was a single theory. I do remember that the
                    Political Scientist was so liberal that a lot of people in AID when they found
                    out what was going on were alarmed that he might be practically a Marxist. He
                    wasn't really a Marxist, but he was very oriented toward equity issues. I can't
                    remember specifically whether he supported the idea of the dependency theory
                    school of economics or not, but he was probably sympathetic to it, and this, of
                    course, went very much against the grain in AID, where I think the Economists
                    tended to run policy probably to a great extent, and were a pretty conservative
                    bunch. Anyway, those training opportunities were very useful.</p>
                <p>I might also mention one other thing that I got to do during my stint in Near
                    East DP, which was to lead an evaluation team to Nepal to study the impact of
                    AID's education program there over the past 20 years. This was an initiative
                    taken by Administrator Doug Bennet. In fact, I think it was probably his major
                    initiative. He felt that more evaluations ought to be done by AID people
                    themselves, rather than by contractors. He thought that, by pulling people out
                    of Bureaus other than the one in which this project or program was being
                    evaluated, he could insure objectivity. That probably wasn't true, but he
                    thought it was. In any event, quite a series of impact evaluations were done
                    with teams that were created in Bureaus other than the one in which the project
                    was to be evaluated. I got to go to Nepal, and that was really a peak experience
                    in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find out about 20 years of education
                        assistance in Nepal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, we entitled the paper, “USAID Education Assistance to Nepal: a
                    20-Year Beginning.” That was because we found that the program had created
                    schools and teachers out of nothing. There was virtually nothing to begin with
                    and now there were hundreds of schools spread throughout the country. The only
                    problem was that there wasn't any equipment in the schools. The teachers tended
                    to show up late, if they showed up at all. There wasn't any real monitoring or
                    supervision. Even the most basic teaching materials just weren't there. So, it
                    was kind of rote learning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our program was mostly a school building program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it wasn't supposed to have been. It was supposed to have equipped
                    the schools, and it was supposed to have provided education for a lot of the
                    teachers in the country. The question, of course, is how can you segregate AID's
                    impact from all the other donors and from what the host country was doing.
                    Actually, that wasn't too difficult a question, because it turned out that
                    virtually the entire education program, including the Ministry and everything
                    else, had been supported with local currency that AID had accumulated in India
                    through its vast Title I and Title II Programs, especially Title I. The currency
                    had been sterilized, because it would have had a tremendous inflationary effect
                    in India if it had been used. Taking a chunk of it and using it for this major
                    program in Nepal didn't really put a dent in the Indian surplus, but it made all
                    the difference in Nepal in terms of whether you could do anything or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impact of the program after 20 years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think the impact was that people were getting some basic education.
                    This was creating some attitude changes that were positive for development. The
                    education had positive impacts on the agricultural sector, family planning
                    attitudes, and health practices, and was creating somewhat more equality and
                    respect for women. We used a fairly standard questionnaire in all our
                    interviews. When we got to Nepal there were three of us, and we formed ourselves
                    into three teams of three by adding, first, a woman, since only the women could
                    go into women's houses and talk to them; and second, a Nepali to each team so
                    that we had the language capability. We then went to three different sections of
                    the country and used essentially the same questionnaire. We realized there
                    wouldn't be enough interviews to make it statistically meaningful, but
                    nevertheless it would give us more than an anecdotal idea what was happening. I
                    got to go trekking in the Annapurna range, which was fabulous just as an
                    experience, being out there and trekking for six days, and then finding the
                    rural villages and visiting the schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about measuring impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: We just asked the people we interviewed questions like: did your training
                    help you become a better teacher; what's the difference now in education here as
                    opposed to 20 years ago; how would you characterize it? A combination of
                    specific questions and open-ended questions. There hadn't really been any
                    quantitative indicators set for the program in the first place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't have any data base to work from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, which of course is a very common occurrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Except, there would have been almost nothing there to
                        begin with anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Very little. We had some data on that. We also looked at the vocational
                    education program. That was a real failure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Because nobody who graduated from vocational school went out and
                    practiced those vocations. What, in fact, happened was, since it was the highest
                    form of education in the country, the vocational schools were really seen as
                    stepping stones to progress into white collar rather than blue collar
                    occupations, and people were able to make that step. That hadn't been thought
                    through in the beginning. As a result, the program really wasn't accomplishing
                    what it meant to. Anyway, I just mentioned that as being one element of
                    particular interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that became a regular official report of the
                        evaluation system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. AID published all those impact evaluations in a series.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was it published?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with the Administrator? What was his reaction
                        to what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, we did. As I recall, he was sort of noncommittal. One of the things
                    that made this evaluation, I think, particularly interesting and important to
                    him was that he was actually considering eliminating the education sector from
                    AID. So this evaluation might have had some impact on that decision. It probably
                    did. That was why the Chief of the Central AID Education Office made sure that
                    he was one of the three members of the team. We came to the conclusion that
                    there was much room for improvement in how we were doing education programs, but
                    that enough was being achieved and it was such an important sector that it
                    should be continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you conclude that we established the first education
                        program in Nepal in terms of ministry and structure and so on that they have
                        been building on since then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, it also suggests how long it takes to start from

                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: And really accomplish something qualitatively, as well as
                    quantitatively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember how large the student body grew over the

                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I would have to look it up. I don't know. It was hundreds of thousands. I
                    mean, it really was throughout the entire country. Of course, something would
                    have happened even if we hadn't done so much. The country was at the stage where
                    if other donors had come forth with financing, maybe they would have
                    accomplished something. But, as it was, we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming back to your regular Near East duties, how would
                        you characterize your experience overall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a job where I was continually caught up in the process of annual
                    program and budget reviews and submissions to the Hill, and review of projects.
                    You would just finish one cycle and then start another one. It was pretty
                    repetitive, except for the occasions that I was Acting Director when I would
                    also get to interact with the Evaluation Staff and the economists. I thought it
                    was a very interesting period in the Middle East, though, and I was perfectly
                    happy for the first five years at least. At that point, I think Langmaid moved
                    up to Deputy Assistant Administrator and they brought in a series of other
                    Foreign Service Officers into the DP Directorship job. I had mixed experiences
                    working with them, depending on who they were. And it seemed as time went by
                    they changed more and more frequently and became less and less competent. I had
                    been in the job too long. I'd begun to grow sterile. I was probably a bit
                    embittered by the Obey experience, as were many GS employees. So I think I
                    probably stopped being as responsive and flexible and as much of a
                    do-anything-I-can-to-help-out sort of person as I had been. I know that both of
                    my final supervisors thought that I was contentious. One used the phrase,
                    “mercurial relationships” with my staff and supervisors. I had some difficulties
                    with staff toward the end of the period. People who just didn't think writing
                    Congressional Presentations was worth anybody's time or attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I made a big mistake with one person. I tried to put into effect one of the
                    things I thought I had learned during one of my management courses: different
                    strokes for different folks, and that you should adapt the management style to
                    the particular individual. This one seemed to be underperforming in view of his
                    educational background. It seemed that he should be doing better. I thought he
                    was lazy, so I started cracking the whip rather than being supportive, and that
                    didn't work at all. I know that I always worked best under supportive
                    leadership. It would have been better if I'd just said, well, I'm really not
                    capable of doing different styles, I'll just try to provide supportive
                    leadership. I could indicate where things needed to be improved, but not really
                    bear down on the person the way I did. It turned out that I had a terrible
                    effect on him and he started having nightmares and sleepless nights. I learned
                    of this from another person on the staff whom I'd asked to let me know how he
                    was doing. This was the Controller, who was a wise old head and perceived what
                    was happening. He was within my Division, but not within the program part. He
                    told me this was happening, so I let up, but this guy, I think probably was very
                    negative and vocal behind my back about my performances as supervisor. And there
                    were some other complaints, although I had good relations with most of my staff
                    and excellent relations with some. Overall I think I had a good record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Well, let's move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, I suffered from that and as a result, when the Near East Bureau and
                    the Asia Bureau were merged in 1985, I was not made a member of the management
                    team that was created out of the two Bureaus. I was basically dropped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they create or integrate them or were they just two
                        Bureaus with the same head?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They integrated the DP's completely. I think otherwise, they probably
                    just added Desks. They probably integrated the Technical Office and the Capital
                    Development Offices. That was a painful experience, particularly the way it was
                    done. I mean, nobody even said thank you for nine years of hard work. I felt
                    that I'd somehow become a pariah. Fortunately, at that point the Yemen Mission
                    Director asked me to come out and do a TDY on developing a private sector
                    strategy there, so that gave me something to do while I was waiting for
                    placement in another job. And it was good for my morale, because he asked for me
                    personally, despite the fact that I was not in the office that would normally do
                    that job. Someone still appreciated me.</p>
                <p>Returned to the LAC Bureau in the Program Office andthe Central American
                    Initiative - 1985</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>While I was out there, Bill Wheeler, who was the head of LAC/DP, had a vacancy
                    and asked me to come in as the Senior Analyst for Central America and as Special
                    Assistant to him. He wanted to streamline and improve the management of office
                    operations in certain ways. He was aware that we were doing things in the Near
                    East in a much more streamlined way with regard to certain things then than they
                    were in LAC. He wanted to know what they were and he, I think, needed a
                    counterweight to the opposition to change of the Chief of the Program Division
                    there, who'd been doing it the same way for 25 years. I got there a couple of
                    years after the Central American Initiative had been established. Again, I
                    seemed to have the good fortune to arrive in a program just when it was
                    becoming, or shortly after it had become, a very important program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of the Central American
                        Initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That it was a major response to the possibility of the Central American
                    countries becoming Communist. It was in response to what had happened in
                    Nicaragua and was basically driven by a sort of domino theory. El Salvador was
                    also very shaky. The initiative was to provide enough aid, and the kinds of aid,
                    needed to keep Central America in the Western camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 19...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The Initiative itself, I think began in 1983. That was when Reagan made a
                    speech and Kissinger made a speech, which were the foundations for the new
                    thrust and to some extent set forth the priorities Kissinger had articulated in
                    a broad way. You know, it takes time for these things to build up. It was still
                    building up when I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in 1985?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: '85, and the office was still working on strategy papers. It had done one
                    and they were doing a revised one, and I played a role in that and found it very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the strategy you worked on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I reviewed the whole paper and made my own inputs. Particularly, I
                    debated with the economists what their targets were and whether they were
                    realistic. They were promoting an export-driven strategy. The idea was to find
                    higher value exports, particularly agribusiness, as opposed to lower value
                    domestically consumed crops. Strawberries and cut flowers and things like that
                    had sprung up to some extent and seemed promising for the North American market.
                    The only question in my mind was whether there was really enough of that to
                    create the employment and therefore the income that was needed to make a
                    substantial difference. I don't think it did. I never got a good answer out of
                    the economists on that. But, as in the Middle East, there were a lot of
                    resources being applied to the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What scale of program are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: At its peak, it was over a billion dollars a year, which in fact was
                    about two-thirds of the Latin America Bureau budget. Now, it didn't stay at the
                    peak forever, but it built up to that and began to slowly decline and then at a
                    certain point dramatically declined. But it was fun being involved with such a
                    high-profile program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the money mostly being spent on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was mostly spent on development programs with DA criteria being used,
                    except for the balance of payments assistance components. Balance of payments
                    assistance to El Salvador was enormous, since El Salvador was one of the
                    countries in particular that we were worried about. Where in fact there was, I
                    guess, a civil war going on, a low grade civil war. That type of aid was
                    provided on the basis of balance of payments needs and certain growth
                    objectives. Actually, it quite resembled the Vietnam Program in the sense that
                    we were looking for ways to win the minds and hearts of the El Salvador people
                    in the villages. We didn't have people in every village, but we found ways to
                    put money into every village for village-level projects, as well as doing things
                    at the Ministerial level. And there was emphasis on agriculture and agribusiness
                    and developing the private sector in all the countries. With Reagan coming in,
                    this became a much more important element oAID's program, even though it had
                    always been there to some degree or other. The housing program was still
                    attempting to prove that it could do something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sound skeptical about the housing program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. I can't say that I've ever seen a housing program in the field that
                    I thought looked truly cost effective and sustainable, and I saw quite a few of
                    them. It's possible that the one in Egypt may have worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>In Central America there was also lots of training, an enormous amount of
                    training. A huge scholarship program to bring people here, that actually was
                    held up by the Congress at levels above what we would have wanted to do.
                    Congress was very involved in this particular initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They thought the training in the U.S. was important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. And, they also felt that it benefitted universities in the States in
                    which they were interested. So there were certain Congressmen who were
                    particularly vocal about it. In fact, Georgetown University was the prime
                    contractor, and Georgetown had its own connections on the Hill and lobbied for
                    the training quite effectively.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did the processing of the participants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Right. Most of them didn't go to Georgetown, but Georgetown would find
                    appropriate places for them in other colleges.</p>
                <p>We also had environmental programs. They were beginning to become significant.
                    Just go down the AID's list of priority development activities: we did it all.
                    Rural health programs and family planning to the maximum extent that we could
                    function in the family planning area. We had lots of difficulties with that in
                    Guatemala as I recall, but we would try to get the rural health system
                    functioning better and hope that one would be able to do something with family
                    planning within that context, even if it was only child spacing. What else? Do
                    you want more?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, no if you have some more we can add it or you can
                        add it later if you like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was a broad DA program. The other thing that was interesting about it
                    was that this was sort of the birth of the democracy program, the democracy
                    initiative in AID, which was really kicked off by Reagan's speech in 1983 where
                    he said, “we are going to promote democracy around the world.” So, since we had
                    so much money to work with, and since one Assistant Administrator in particular
                    who came in was very interested in that, particularly the administration of
                    justice aspect of it. These projects began to spring up in ad hoc way. This was
                    Jim Michel, a former State Department person, Ambassador to Guatemala, and a
                    lawyer. Election observation teams were sent out, for example, to try to ensure
                    that free and fair elections were held. In some cases there were human rights
                    activities, which had always been around</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't any sort of coherent strategy for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Not initially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ad hoc opportunities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Initially. So these democracy strengthening activities were going on,
                    too. In addition to my program review duties, I was given the democracy
                    portfolio. A separate office had been created for this. Not even an office: it
                    was just a staff unit for democracy. It was headed by an AID lawyer who thought
                    this was more fun than being a lawyer, and one or two people. They were
                    developing regional programs, as well as backstopping the field. So there was a
                    democracy program that became a unit like a Mission program that needed to be
                    reviewed. Since most of it was taking place in Central America, I took that on,
                    along with the Central American programs. Every year the democracy office would
                    come in with their submission and every year I would say, “Where is your
                    strategy?” They were so busy, you know, just trying to get projects going,
                    particularly since Ambassador Michel would go home every weekend and think up
                    some other new idea that he thought it would be fun to start, that they never
                    got to the point of being able to develop a strategy until later. In a way I'm
                    getting ahead of my story, because that was what I did next after five years in
                    LAC/DP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the activities that Michel was pushing for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Mostly in the administration of justice area, initially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Improved court procedures; training of lawyers; attempts to revise the
                    legal system where needed, particularly since most of the countries were
                    operating with a Napoleonic code that was inadequate for private sector
                    development. Mostly stuff like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense of it having any impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was just too early to decide whether there was any effect. Things were
                    just getting started. And there was an issue of program proliferation, because
                    by this time we were under heavy pressure to concentrate our program, because of
                    overall budget and staff cuts. Yet here was Michel sort of opening up a new
                    sector, so he had to do it quietly and carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't well received within the agency as a
                        priority?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Eventually it was, but that's a story I can get into a little bit later.
                    First, let me just finish talking about Central America. One of the most
                    interesting things I did while I was there was codraft with the Chief Economist
                    a revised regional development plan for the region. We did this when it became
                    obvious that initially projected accomplishments were way behind schedule
                    because the requested funding had not materialized. In revising the plan we
                    actually did something which I'd never seen any other Bureau dare to do, which
                    was to actually spell out quantified objectives for the Central American
                    Initiative. We said, five years from now, if you give us this much money, we
                    will have accomplished this and this. Sector by sector we established targets,
                    as well as overall growth targets. Though I could never get them to put targets
                    for employment, probably the single most important objective. Basically the
                    thought was, to make a pact with Congress and commit ourselves to try to
                    accomplish these things in the next five years if Congress would commit to
                    providing a certain amount of funding. We went through a whole exercise with the
                    Missions and ROCAP to develop this. The document was very well received on the
                    Hill and helped hold up funding levels for a while, though not for the entire
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you reach these targets? How did you decide what
                        the targets were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, we would start by asking the Chief of each Technical Office to work
                    with field Missions to establish them, so that in training it would be such and
                    such and education would be such and such, and health would be such and such.
                    Then, if they appeared inconsistent or if we thought maybe there were better
                    indicators, we would suggest changes and go through an interactive process,
                    finally reaching agreement. The economists did the work, the macro work. I
                    spearheaded the work on the sectoral level objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the targets were realistic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think they were. They were somewhat conservative, because we really
                    didn't want to be left hanging out there, you know, showing that we'd only
                    achieved half of them. But the whole thing sort of fell apart before it was
                    finished, because the funding collapsed. So we were ultimately never held to
                    account for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the funding collapse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It was because we won the Cold War. When did the Berlin Wall come
                    down?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1988.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SELLAR: '88, exactly. I had always thought that winning the Cold War would be a
                    wonderful thing and that AID would get more money to work with, because we'd be
                    spending so much less on military and security assistance that we could do more
                    on development assistance. But, of course, it didn't work that way at all. It
                    turned out that the Congressional support for AID had depended very heavily on
                    the security rationale. We'd always thought that it was a combination of the
                    security-oriented people on the right with the humanitarian-oriented people on
                    the left that enabled us to get a bill every year, but when the Wall came down
                    and the Cold War was won, our budgets dropped drastically. Overnight, Congress
                    wasn't concerned about the Soviet menace in Central America anymore, and the
                    budgets reflected that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean dramatically? From what to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It would probably be, oh, from a peak of a billion to no more than two or
                    three hundred million dollars. We had a phasedown schedule associated with the
                    plan anyway, but we probably only got about half as much money as we had asked
                    for and projected in our plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any feel for the impact of the program for all
                        that money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it did have an impact while it was going on. There's no doubt
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it just short term or did it have any lasting
                        results?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: You know, that's hard to say, because you know how it is in AID, when you
                    go on to the next thing you never look back. There's bound to have been some
                    lasting effects, but I never went back and tried to assess it. I never had the
                    opportunity to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular issues you had to address apart from what
                        you have mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>SELLAR: There was that issue with the economists about an employment objective.
                    Also, I've mentioned that I was also made Special Assistant to the Office
                    Director to streamline the programming system, just the documentation system. We
                    did that, but it had to be debated and I had to persuade the existing Program
                    Officer that we could do it, and demonstrate how it had been done in the Near
                    East. This boiled down to things like sending out one budget allowance to the
                    field for its entire program, rather than doling it out project by project as
                    the year went by. We made that change in the Near East quite a while ago. When
                    we did in Latin America, it saved about 250 budget allowances each year. It cut
                    down on the scut work. Also, in the Near East we'd developed some rationale,
                    which I can't remember the details of, for sending up fewer Congressional
                    Notifications, and we applied that to LAC. That saved about 75 of those every
                    year, which cut down on the paper work. That was really what they wanted me to
                    do, and after that I really just spent my time on Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any changes in delegations in that
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No. The changes in delegation were coming about and had come about by
                    virtue of the Asia Bureau experiment. That had already happened.</p>
                <p>I did fine in LAC/DP and enjoyed it the first three years or so, and then a new
                    Director came in who boasted that he was the only person in AID who read “The
                    Washington Times” instead of “The Washington Post.” We had some disagreements,
                    both substantive and stylistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his main substantive interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Growth. As with the economists. He really didn't care about equity.
                    Actually the funny thing is we didn't disagree that much, but when we did it was
                    monumental. One area was the importance of environmental issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he very private-sector oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Oh, yes. He had originally been an agricultural economist. He'd been in
                    AID for quite a while. He was private-sector oriented, but so was I. So there
                    wasn't any particular disagreement there. I think he tended to magnify the areas
                    that we did disagree in. My problem was, I was not as diplomatic about
                    expressing the differences as I was earlier in my career. Again, carrying
                    forward this notion of having been screwed by the Obey Amendment. Then toward
                    the end of my stint in LAC/ DP, the office was decimated by a decision by the
                    Assistant Administrator to wipe out most of the analyst positions and use them
                    for, you can call it information, or you can call it propaganda. Basically it
                    was to advance some younger folks who were working on data systems that would
                    enable him to make a better presentation to Congress on accomplishments and
                    impress people on the Hill. I saw that as being a sort of politicization of the
                    Bureau. And, of course, I had to say that. That made the Director very angry,
                    and of course it got to Michel, too. So, with the office being reorganized and
                    changed in that fashion, I was tossed off in the corner as some sort of a
                    strategist and found myself reporting to junior people, which was really
                    insulting.</p>
                <p>Assignment to work on democratic initiatives</p>
                <p>Fortunately, at the time that this happened, the Office of Democratic
                    Initiatives, which by then had become a true office, had gotten so tired of
                    hearing me ask where their strategy was every year, that they said, “How about
                    if you write it?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this office of Democratic Initiates
                        located?</hi>

                <p>SELLAR: It was in the LAC Bureau.</p>

                <p>SELLAR: Right. There was no central one at that time.</p>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Jim Michel. However, it had to go through the same programming process
                    that the Missions did, but if they had a problem with any decisions reached at a
                    lower level they could go to the AA and, in fact, they often did and, in fact,
                    they usually won, because this was his baby. What happened was that DI, as we
                    called it, the Office of Democratic Initiatives, decided that they really did
                    need a strategy. They had a new Director who came in who was a pretty impressive
                    lady in my opinion, Norma Parker, who decided that she needed a strategy and
                    decided that she would like to ask DP if I could spend some time and do it,
                    since I'd been involved with the program. She seemed to think that I could do
                    it. Since I was at that point sinking into obscurity in DP, it was a good time
                    for me and she asked for me to be detailed to her office for a few months to
                    write this strategy, and DP agreed to that. And during the course of that, in
                    fact she was able to get additional ceiling and invited me to transfer into her
                    office, which I did with great relief. So I spent about six months writing the
                    strategy, not all by myself, but with some consultant assistance, particularly
                    on the chapter that had to do with Latin America's specifics. But mostly I wrote
                    it myself and called it a Draft Democratic Regional Strategy Framework for Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was all of Latin America, not just Central
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Right. The idea was that this would be a framework that would be
                    applicable in any of the countries in terms of basic parameters for programs.
                    Defining democracy, trying to define the requisites for democracy, and talking
                    about the assets of and constraints to democratic consolidation in Latin
                    America. There had been this wave already, what Sam Huntington calls the third
                    wave of democratic development, and many of the countries had had elections, but
                    were still very fragile as democracies. Then in the paper I set forth the
                    proposed strategic framework, and the components of a program, which was
                    basically organized into three areas of activities that would be acceptable.
                    Making it clear that we didn't expect everybody to start all of them. In fact,
                    suggesting the only way this fairly long list of activities could be
                    incorporated into a country program would be by analysis of that country and its
                    particular needs and priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the three areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They were, first, what is now called governance, basically more effective
                    and more honest government. Second, civil society, which was a term that was
                    unfamiliar to most people in AID, but was very common among political scientists
                    and referred to the cluster of organizations that exist in democracies that are
                    not themselves seeking power, not political parties, but that are existing for
                    humanitarian purposes, for religious purposes, or for other purposes. In many
                    cases to try to influence the State...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not the same as an NGO? We call them non-governmental
                        organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, they'd be part of it, but not the entire thing. That's an actual
                    issue that came up in AID from time to time and people began equating PVOs with
                    civil society. In fact, it's more complicated than that. Civil society would
                    include the press and universities, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the third area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The third area was called improving the political culture, i.e.
                    developing democratic values, which primarily meant civic education and any
                    kinds of programs, including early childhood programs, that would emphasize
                    democratic as opposed to authoritarian values and practices.</p>
                <p>That's the way this paper was presented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do any sort of research on democracy, as well as
                        on the country situations? Were you able to write a strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, I had to. I didn't have any background in political science,
                    although I did have a college major in American History and Literature, so I
                    knew something about the development of democracy in this country. But I had to
                    do a lot of reading. In fact, it took me six months to do that research and
                    produce a draft. Quite a long time, quite a luxury to be given that amount of
                    time as an AID employee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a group of people to work with on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I had a few people. Just based on the reading I did, I was able to
                    identify a couple of political scientists who I thought were particularly good,
                    and also, who were able to relate their theoretical work to reality in terms of
                    translating it into programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Latin American contacts in which you're
                        doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That was in an area in which I was also weak, since I'd previously only
                    had a short stint in the Central American Bureau. Well, I'd had five years in
                    DP, but again that was all Central America. I had no South American experience,
                    nor Caribbean, except I had gone to Haiti for a few days on vacation once. So I
                    didn't even try to write that part of it. I had some thoughts on what it should
                    say, but I sought Latin American experts to do that section. Actually, I only
                    got it right with the third person whom I hired to take a crack at it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Her name was Esther Hannah. She teaches at Washington College or one of
                    those colleges further South in Virginia. She was married to a guy who was
                    working in AID/PPC, a political appointee. She was very good, I thought, and
                    really did a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with Latin American contacts on democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Right. She was a Latin America specialist. So, I finished the draft by
                    May of '91. Interestingly enough, just to show how sometimes AID can operate
                    without the left hand knowing what the right hand is doing, the Asia Bureau at
                    virtually the same time was also preparing a strategy paper, but they were using
                    an outside contracting firm to do it. Their paper emerged just about the same
                    time ours did as the first two Bureau strategies for democracy. There were many
                    similarities in the papers, which was encouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to your strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, it got used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it approved and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: No, it wasn't approved, but it wasn't disapproved either. It created a
                    firestorm of objections within the Bureau from some of our more conservative
                    folks. Some were agricultural officers hopping up and down and complaining that
                    I'd quoted from some left-wing Communist person and that therefore, nothing that
                    that person ever said should be regarded as of value, as true. Again, my old
                    boss in DP didn't like it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they objecting to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, they were objecting, I think, in part just to the style of the
                    introduction and to some things that were said in the paper that struck them as
                    being too far to the left. To me, it was just what had happened. I mean, it was
                    just based on reading history, but they found it offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I may have not been as totally supportive in some cases of what we were
                    doing in El Salvador and against Noriega as they wanted, but it was minor stuff
                    really. I mean, the interesting thing is it's stuff that could easily have been
                    changed without affecting the thrust of the paper. And we said, “Hey fellows,
                    this is a draft. That's why we're here. We're here to have it reviewed.” But the
                    DP Director got sort of apoplectic and felt that it should be taken out of our
                    office and redone by somebody else. But the Assistant Administrator, whose vote
                    after all was the one that really counted, had issues with it. He realized that
                    these other things could be fixed easily, but he had a basic issue with it,
                    because I argued that even though there had been this wave of democratic
                    elections in Latin America, it was clear from the historical record that that
                    had happened before and then democracy had failed to take root. And, therefore
                    there was no assurance, in spite of the latest wave, that the countries were
                    going to stay democratic. They were fragile and a number of things really needed
                    to be done to consolidate the gains. Michel didn't like that. He wanted to
                    present it as a much more positive picture. His concern was that if Congress
                    read it my way, they would think that any money we put into this could go down
                    the drain and therefore, why do it. I'd argued, and my office argued, that
                    unless we indicated their weaknesses and vulnerabilities and deficits that
                    needed to be dealt with, why have a program. We never agreed on that. He also
                    objected to going into as much detail as we did in terms of our projections of
                    funding levels and so forth. He didn't like that. Okay, fine, we said, we'll
                    take that out. But, actually the paper had already been in use for at least
                    three months before we got to the review, because consultants were going out to
                    the field and saying, “What have you got? Give me a framework for what I'm
                    doing.” So, with the permission of my Director I was giving them copies of
                    whatever earlier draft I had when they needed it. Similarly, in the Missions,
                    those who picked up on it wanted it and were using it and we did send it to the
                    Missions, of course, for review and comment before we went to this final
                    meeting, and the Missions didn't have any problems with it. The Missions liked
                    it. Two of them, in fact said that it was the best strategy paper they'd ever
                    seen, which was gratifying, and Michel knew that. So, what he did was say,
                    “Well, just go on working with it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not face the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. Just keep calling it a draft. We're not going to approve
                    it, but we're not going to disapprove it. Time to get on with it, let's go
                    ahead; and that's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more to bring out the issues and substance or the
                        strategy that you were having to respond to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>SELLAR: The first issue was what we should be doing and what we should not be
                    doing. We came up with a list of about a dozen things that we thought ought to
                    be done. The first items were in the governance area. Under strengthening
                    governance, we called for strengthening the competence of political and
                    government institutions, and under that, strengthening the rule of law, which
                    was already going on through the Administration of Justice Program; but we also
                    added to that strengthening adherence to internationally recognized human
                    rights; and implementing new initiatives to strengthen property rights. This
                    focused on improving the legal and regulatory climate for business, and for
                    titling land and property. Now, strictly speaking, that's not really part of the
                    democracy program, but if we're going to have lawyers out there, working on
                    improving the process as a whole, it made sense to do that too. This was an
                    issue: some people felt it was in fact development that would produce democracy.
                    Other people felt that democracy would produce development. That's the way AID
                    argued it, both ways. All the literature said that development would, in fact
                    improve democracy, but there was no evidence for the reverse. In any event, this
                    was really more of a private sector initiative, but just made sense to put it
                    there since it was law. There was a private sector office too and we would try
                    to work with them.</p>
                <p>The second item was strengthening the electoral processes by providing technical
                    assistance to the creation of functioning, credible electoral commissions, voter
                    registration programs, and international observer teams. We worked through
                    established regional organizations as much as possible to avoid too strong a
                    U.S. presence in these activities, which of course not long ago had been
                    unthinkable, too political to get involved in. There was a lot of controversy as
                    the democracy initiative turned into a program between those who felt that AID
                    should get involved in it and those who felt that we shouldn't, since AID had
                    always been thought of, and thought of itself as a technical organization, even
                    though of course any intervention you make has political/economic consequences.
                    AID had wanted to stay out of anything overtly political so they didn't get
                    tainted with being partisan, with being identified too closely with one
                    administration or another, so they could go on developing the institutions, and
                    programs they were trying to develop. So, many people felt that democracy was
                    just something that AID shouldn't get into and particularly working on
                    elections. But, in fact, the election observation teams and related technical
                    assistance were one of the most successful parts of the program. It didn't
                    encounter resistance at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>The final part of the government activities, very bluntly stated, was improve the
                    honesty and competence of the executive branches through continuation and
                    expansion of a financial management project, which involved putting a GAO-type
                    person into the ministries, and initiation of activities to improve generally
                    the efficiency and effectiveness of government in key areas, which was actually
                    a way of trying to reform the administrative culture. Now, that is an issue too,
                    because that gets you back into the area of public administration, which had
                    been generally throughout the agency perceived as a program that had failed and
                    that we were not going to try to do again. So, actually, part of the strategy
                    paper deals with that issue. It talks about why the earlier effort had failed
                    and how we would do it differently this time and why it was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did it fail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, my understanding is that it was because it was too academic. We
                    would bring advisors out of public administration schools, or we would set up
                    schools of public administration in some cases that just really weren't focused
                    on the real problems. The real problems were usually much more basic than the
                    rather elaborate areas of institutional development and whatnot, that public
                    administration professors are fond of. Also, I don't think it was ever
                    recognized that in some cases there were successes. I mean, there was a very
                    successful school of public administration in Latin America, as a matter of
                    fact.</p>
                <p>But, that was the exception to the rule. A fourth item was strengthening
                    decentralization and devolution of power through expanded assistance to local
                    municipal governments. This was sort of a given in AID that that was a good
                    thing too. In fact, the literature presents mixed evidence; there are arguments
                    for and against it. But we decided that we were for it and that we were going to
                    do it.</p>
                <p>Another item was to strengthen civilian control of the military. Again, this was
                    an area where people said, how in the world can you touch that? But we did it in
                    a subtle enough way that it worked, through support of dialogues on improving
                    civilian and military agreement on appropriate roles for the military and new
                    measures to reduce military autonomy. Of course, the big, big problem in Latin
                    America was the power of the army. But by having non-threatening seminars and so
                    forth, initially you could begin to get at some of the issues.</p>
                <p>A sixth item was strengthening legislatures, through technical assistance and
                    training, and to strengthen their analytic and oversight capabilities. For the
                    most part they tended to be very weak rubber-stamp types of organizations.</p>
                <p>Seventh was strengthening political parties, primarily by working through the
                    National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, and by
                    supporting programs of the National Endowment for Democracy where needed.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>This all was what we included under the first element of the strategy:
                    governance. The second element was helping create a vigorous, autonomous civil
                    society. Under that we had first, strengthening alternative opinion and
                    information sources, including continued support for a regional journalism
                    project which had been started, and distribution of textbooks and a new
                    initiative to strengthen think tanks. The next item was strengthening civic,
                    professional and community organizations, and continuing support for free,
                    democratically oriented labor unions. This latter project had been operating for
                    20 years and was regarded as an entitlement program with virtually no oversight.
                    It was operated out of a regional projects office in LAC/DP. Part of the deal in
                    my going from DP to DI was that the labor project would be transferred with me,
                    and I would manage it. DP saw an opportunity to get rid of it. So that was an
                    interesting part of my job, as well as the customary program officer stuff. The
                    third element of the strategy was strengthening democratic values and
                    leadership. That included expanding support for formal and non-formal civic
                    education programs; continuing support for leadership training programs through
                    CLASP (Central and Latin American Scholarship Program), which was the huge
                    umbrella for participant training programs through various universities; and
                    support of other organizations that strengthen democratic values and skills.
                    Finally we said we would support other innovative approaches on a pilot basis
                    and replicate them when found effective, a sort of “miscellaneous other”
                    category to give us flexibility. That was the substance of the strategy
                    framework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What areas did you and the Missions work in,
                        commonly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, we got into practically all of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have to do a democracy assessment in each
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. We helped the Missions with that. In fact, we prepared a draft
                    Assessment Handbook, got that done by 1992, which helped the consults and
                    missions ask the right questions under those different categories. It didn't
                    help decide which categories ought to be given higher priority than others.
                    There just wasn't any research that would enable you to do that. In fact, we
                    held a series of seminars with the National Academy of Sciences that coordinated
                    and brought in academics. This was global, not just for Latin America. We
                    engaged with each other and learned about each other, and it was helpful. One of
                    the seminars was devoted to the question, could priorities be created,
                    recognizing that what we had was a framework, but that was all it was. It didn't
                    enable you to recognize or sequence the activities and it didn't enable you to
                    know very much about the causality of problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reception to all this strategizing and
                        approach to strengthening democracy by the Latin American country
                        governments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Oh, I think they were eager to have it. In many cases you had strong
                    reform movements or even reformist presidents as a result of the wave of
                    elections that had occurred. In several cases the military had sort of given up
                    or been persuaded to go back to the barracks and let the civilians try, because
                    the military had done so poorly. So there was receptivity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any country that stood out as picking it up and running
                        with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it was strongest initially, in Central America, just because
                    that's where it had gotten started. There were significant resources to apply
                    there even after the later budget cuts. Most of our South American programs had
                    very little money to work with, but they did get into it also. There was a
                    special program in Colombia, dealing with training police and trying to help
                    them deal with their drugs problem. Guatemala was a program that comes to mind.
                    Not necessarily because they picked it up and ran with it any more than the
                    others, but because it was one of the early experiments, and we did quite a bit
                    to try to reform the judicial system. This really didn't work. You could achieve
                    all kinds of technical improvements and you could give them new desks and word
                    processors and air conditioners and cars and so forth, and get libraries set up
                    and organized, but</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose the toughest problem would be dealing with the
                        business of instituting values or changing values and so on. How did you
                        find that worked and what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, yes, that was the toughest challenge, because that's the
                    longest-term part of the program. You can't really expect to see too much impact
                    until you get to the next generation. But we were invited to help them revise
                    their curriculum in their civics textbooks, or whatever they were called. Most
                    of them that I saw were just hopelessly unrealistic. For example, in El
                    Salvador, which was practically like Vietnam, the books had shining, smiling
                    faces describing this ideal system. Nobody would find it credible. In Nicaragua,
                    the history books and texts had all been written by the communist-oriented
                    regime. So everything Communist was good and everything U.S. was bad. That had
                    to be revised and the new government invited us to do that. We had a major
                    textbook revision program there. In cases where we couldn't or didn't have the
                    resources in the Mission to penetrate the formal education system, we tried to
                    do informal courses. There was a PVO program that we got started with Partners
                    of the Americas that was a pilot effort in a few countries to start working on
                    civic education with local NGOs and anybody else they could find to work with.
                    That was very hard to get approved, because again the conservative element in
                    the Bureau felt it was messing with people's values, “social engineering” a
                    pejorative term, and didn't think that such a program would be well received.
                    But, in fact the pilot program caught on like wildfire. The last time I talked
                    with the President of the organization...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Partners of the Americas. The initial small grant that started them, a
                    million or two, had already resulted in over four million dollars in mission
                    add-ons. And that was quite quickly. So there was a need for it and a demand for
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do particularly in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I don't know, other than develop civic education programs. In many cases,
                    I'm sure it was integrated into things that they were already doing with these
                    local NGOs. You're familiar with the Partnership program: they had extensive
                    contacts in every country. You could go right to work..</p>
                <p>So the strategy paper, although formally never approved, was I think successful
                    and useful, as was the Assessments Handbook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you want to consider adding it as an annex?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I can attach whatever you want. [See Annexes B and C.] But, these
                    are not short pieces. One other thing that happened was that the Caribbean
                    countries, the British Commonwealth countries who had not been included in the
                    Latin American strategy, asked for their own strategy paper. This was because in
                    terms of generalities, Haiti was a part of the Latin American strategy, and so
                    was the Dominican Republic, but the Anglophone countries had much stronger
                    democratic traditions and very different cultural and historical backgrounds.
                    They were much better functioning democracies. We had Missions in Jamaica and a
                    Regional Mission in Barbados and they both said, hey, what about us. The Latin
                    America strategy is good for all these other countries, but it doesn't apply to
                    ours. So that gave me the opportunity to make a nice trip to the Caribbean with
                    one of my favorite political science consultants. We did a proposed strategy for
                    them which was not nearly as extensive or intensive as the first paper, and
                    didn't really contain any new elements, but tried to narrow them down a bit and
                    place them in the context of democracies that were already thriving for the most
                    part. Although there were some that were a little shaky, like Grenada. So, we
                    did that strategy paper, in a ridiculously short period of time. [See Annex
                    D.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that picked up and supported?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, the Missions liked it and I'm sure they used it. Since it was for
                    the Missions, it didn't have to be approved in Washington. No one raised the
                    kinds of issues that had been raised with the first paper.</p>
                <p>So, other than the strategy work, I was functioning as the office's Program
                    Officer, which they really hadn't had before I arrived. And consequently they
                    had been kind of the laughing stock of the Bureau when they got to their program
                    reviews, because they didn't have the numbers right. They would sit there and
                    argue with each other about what the numbers were and just generally didn't
                    present themselves as being organized at all, which they weren't. So I just put
                    in the procedures that one needs to put in to get submissions on time and get
                    the Director to make it clear that he wants material prepared on time, which
                    they really weren't use to doing. And analyze basic financial concepts such as
                    making sure that your estimated expenditures didn't add up to more than the
                    project authorization level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were project proposals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right. In some cases, we were developing new regional
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had your own funds, as well as Mission funds?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>SELLAR: We did. A number of our activities had started regionally, and it made
                    sense to do a number of them regionally, to provide expertise and resources.
                    Human rights, for example, is one area that comes to mind, where we could have
                    one regional project instead of having a whole bunch of little mini bilateral
                    projects. It was much more efficient to manage. The journalism project was
                    regional, a pretty substantial project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then the Missions would draw on it for particular country
                        activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Exactly. And they would all have buy-in provisions, so if the Missions
                    wanted to do something larger than the regional project would allow they could
                    just use it as the framework to create their own activity. This was particularly
                    helpful to the Missions that were attempting to start democracy programs with
                    very limited staff time and expertise. We really didn't run into any difficulty
                    while I was there in terms of the usual tension between regional or global and
                    bilateral programs in competing for funding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I was there until I retired, which is to say from 1990 to 1993.</p>
                <p>I might also mention another paper that I wrote while I was still in DP, but that
                    had to do with DI. Jim Michel needed something that he could use on the Hill to
                    defend his democratic initiatives and to promote the idea of strengthening
                    democracy in the region, so he asked for a paper that would describe our
                    experience to date. I wrote that, based heavily on input from Norma Parker and
                    Roma McKnee, who were veterans in the DI Office. Norma was the Director and Roma
                    was one of the Project Officers. Of course, we put a positive spin on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an attempt to show that the programs were
                        working, that they were having results?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. Not in every case. I mean, we were reasonably honest. Also, I think
                    we conveyed that it was still too early to say definitively, but the early
                    results were encouraging in different ways, and that we were learning lessons
                    about how not to do things as well as how to do them. We gave some examples of
                    that. So that made the paper appear to be objective, and gave it credibility.
                    Jim Michael was very happy with that paper and used it on the Hill, and said
                    that it helped a lot. He was a very persuasive guy, with or without a paper, but
                    the paper was something you could read when he wasn't around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe it's also something we would like to
                        attach.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Maybe so, since it's not as thick as the others. [See Annex E.] According
                    to Michel, it was significant in terms of persuading the Hill not to object to
                    and even to support the democracy initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any particular thrust or was it just covering
                        the whole range of programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It covered the range of programs that we had been doing up to that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What worked and what didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Right. I went back and started as early as '61 and talked about Title IX
                    a little bit, how that was the precursor to the Initiative. Then the programs
                    from '78 to '96. There actually was an earmark from Congress in '84 for one
                    million dollars for administration of justice in El Salvador, so obviously there
                    was Congressional as well as executive branch interest.</p>
                <p>In the three years that I was there, doing the things that I described, I also
                    managed the AIFLD Program, which had about six or eight million dollars a year
                    going into 20 countries when I got it. Much too much money really in
                    relationship to the total program. And we didn't know anything about what was
                    happening or being accomplished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Labor Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Right. They had never really been asked to justify themselves. This was
                    because President Kennedy had reportedly made a commitment in 1963 to a certain
                    annual level of support. So it just went on year after year, with little if any
                    AID influence over it. But in the new environment that we were in, in terms of
                    resource scarcity, and with the winning of the Cold War in particular, a
                    situation had been created in which Labor knew that, since their program was
                    very much to counter Communist influence in the unions, they were probably going
                    to have to take some reductions, and the opportunity existed for me to
                    rationalize their program. So I worked on that, and we actually developed the
                    first logical framework (log frame) for the program, on a country basis, that
                    had ever been done, and we agreed on a slow reduction in their annual funding
                    together with some targets and objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the logframe change the purpose of what they were
                        trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I don't know that it really changed it, but it clarified it, and I
                    think it forced them to do a lot of thinking about what they were doing
                    themselves, that probably changed things to some degree, just in terms of
                    clarifying and possibly narrowing the scope of their activities. I mean, the
                    very act of doing this, as you know, is often helpful to the person doing it, as
                    much as to the person it is being done for. So we got that done, and included
                    targets for increasing local cost contributions, which they had never bothered
                    to try to do. This was all worked out and we were getting compliments about it
                    from the reviewing officers, and everybody was happy with it. Unfortunately, I
                    think in about the second year it just all fell apart when the Bureau's funding
                    dropped precipitously. That was after I'd left.</p>
                <p>I also worked on developing some projects. One was the civic education and
                    citizen participation project with the Partners that I mentioned. I also worked
                    on developing a civil-military relations projects as a follow-on to the initial
                    activity, which was just basically a couple of seminars. I also developed a
                    technical support project, which was something that I'd learned to do in the
                    Near East Bureau. This was extremely useful. It's not really a project, it's a
                    pot of funding for a collection of activities. It enables you to do studies,
                    evaluations, all the kinds of things that you have to do, and pay for them with
                    program funds. We threw everything but the kitchen sink into it. Limited
                    training, limited preapproval project activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a common pattern in many Bureaus at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, and we did it for our program as well. It was helpful in enabling us
                    to get people out to the field more quickly. Contract people and so forth. And
                    provide more rapid response time. We used it to do a comprehensive evaluation of
                    the AIFLD program, the first time that had ever been done in 32 years. Out of
                    that we formulated a labor development strategy jointly with them.</p>
                <p>Those were my main activities. I was also the LAC representative to an agency
                    working group that became known as the Tuesday Group; it met every Tuesday to
                    try to bring some semblance of coordination and similarity to what the different
                    Regional Bureaus were doing in this new sector, democracy. There were all sorts
                    of debates and things that had to be thrashed out. That was fun. We also wrote
                    an Agency policy paper for Democracy and Governance, as it was called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, your work was as a pioneer, providing a basis for the
                        overall agency strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SELLAR: It was. Ours and the Asia Bureau strategy. The situation was very
                    different in the different Bureaus. Africa was particularly resistant to getting
                    into democracy work. They felt that, my God, they were dealing with terrible
                    problems of poverty. They didn't have enough money even for that, and they felt
                    one needed to reach a certain level of development before you started concerning
                    yourself with democracy. People had to eat first. There was some justification
                    to this viewpoint in the African context, I thought. Then, of course, Eastern
                    Europe and Russia and the former Soviet Union countries came along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the kind of strategy that basically you had laid
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: I expect it is, although I'm not sure. I saw something the other day that
                    described a different document as being the basis, an agency strategy paper or
                    something. If so, it has been redone and I haven't seen it. But, I would doubt
                    that it changed too much, because I used to also do training sessions at the
                    Development Studies Program (DSP). They incorporated a democracy and governance
                    section into their overall development studies program. I would go over and do
                    that sometimes, or get two or three people and we'd go over and do it as a
                    panel. I also did a couple of consulting jobs for AID after I retired that were
                    both democracy-related, in 1994, and then stayed in touch a bit beyond that; and
                    whenever I'd see anybody, they'd say that nothing much had changed. In fact, one
                    of them called and said, “We had another major issue between a so-called
                    political scientist and a political economist, and their approach was quite
                    different.” Ours was a political science approach. The political economists were
                    looking at things in a much shorter term, but they had the virtue of taking into
                    account what the political economy of the country was, perhaps to a greater
                    extent than we did. It would have been a good idea to merge the two approaches,
                    except that their conclusions were very different in terms of what program
                    priorities ought to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they deciding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, having said that, now let's see if I can remember. For some reason,
                    I don't know why it was, they didn't believe in doing civic education at all.
                    They didn't believe that values could be changed, even with a new generation. I
                    don't understand why that was, but I felt that was a real limitation in their
                    perspective. Their perspective was also shorter term, more focused on doing
                    things that would immediately affect the political economy of the situation.
                    That debate never got resolved. I was invited to come and sort of redo the
                    debate for the benefit of one Bureau at a conference for democracy officers, and
                    I said, “Well, I've been gone for three years.” The person calling me said,
                    “Don't worry, nothing has changed at all.” Now I've been gone for five and a
                    half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you retired in 1993?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SELLAR: That's right.</p>
                <p>Post USAID activity</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do any AID-related work after retiring?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, I did a couple of consulting jobs, and wrote a paper on the first
                    ten years of AID's experience with the democracy program. I was also the
                    candidate of a couple of contractors for chief of party for long-term AID
                    contracts, but we did not win either of these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the consulting job you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: They were both in 1994. I served on a three-man team in Guyana that
                    prepared a draft Project Paper for a democracy program there. I served as the
                    quote institutional development specialist unquote and developed a program for
                    strengthening civil society: community development, NGOs, the media, the
                    university. My second job was in Nepal, where I served on a two-man team to
                    review USAID Nepal's democratic development strategy, recommend any changes, and
                    develop benchmarks or indicators for measuring the progress of the democracy
                    program there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the consulting work as compared with
                        being a direct-hire AID employee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: It had both pluses and minuses. The main plus was that the work was
                    almost entirely substantive and hence extremely stimulating. It was also nice to
                    be focused on just one task. Also, it paid very well. The negatives were the
                    marketing that one had to do to get the jobs, and the utter unreliability of AID
                    in scheduling the work or even confirming until the very last minute that I was
                    going to be hired. In the case of the Nepal job, for instance, it was not until
                    I got a call from the desk officer at the airport, after having made my way
                    there through a blizzard, that I knew whether or not I was authorized to board
                    the airplane. This made planning one's life around consulting jobs very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the two long-term contract jobs that you didn't
                        get?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>SELLAR: The first was to be the Chief of Party (COP) for the regional component
                    of a very large - $75 million, I think - project to improve the rule of law in
                    Russia and certain former Soviet Union countries. I was neither a lawyer nor did
                    I have any experience at all working in Russia, but my associates put me forward
                    as their proposed COP because they felt the most important qualification was
                    understanding how AID worked. They found a brilliant young man who had come to
                    the U.S. from Ukraine when he was 14, who was bilingual and a lawyer, to serve
                    as my deputy. Between us we had all the necessary expertise. ABT's proposal got
                    us into the “best-and-final” interview but we lost by two points to another
                    bidder. We had a very strong consortium and organizations to carry out the
                    program, yet we lost to a much weaker contractor. Later, I learned that the real
                    reason we lost was that ABT had already won a major health contract in the
                    region and AID wanted to spread the work around a bit. In retrospect, given what
                    happened in Russia with the growth of lawlessness, it's probably fortunate we
                    didn't win.</p>
                <p>The second job I didn't get was as COP of a team to provide staff and advisers to
                    AID's Office of Private and Voluntary Cooperation. This was the same office I
                    had worked in for four years back in the '70s. The Director, a friend who had
                    been in my intern class entering AID, assured me that there would be a totally
                    open competition despite the fact that there was an incumbent contractor. I was
                    the candidate of Princeton Associates, a minority-owned firm that was bidding
                    together with Louis Berger. It was a minority set-aside contract. We lost out to
                    the incumbent. The AID review panel said that I and other personnel I had
                    recommended were overqualified for the job. Later I learned that AID thought the
                    incumbent was doing a good job and probably had no intention of hiring anyone
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sound a bit caustic about both of these
                        experiences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. In the second case I got sucked into spending quite a bit of time
                    helping the contractors recommend personnel and develop the proposal. Since in
                    both cases the decisions seemed to be made on other than the merits, I became
                    wary of wasting more time on other candidacies. Also, AID would often cancel or
                    defer signing of contracts at the last minute, so you never knew when or whether
                    a job would materialize. So I decided after 1994-5, when all this was going on,
                    to abandon the AID contracting world and go in an entirely different
                    direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Financial planning. That's what I did until 1997, when I retired
                    completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about the paper you wrote on AID's first 10
                        years working on democratic development. [See Annex F]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I wrote it for two reasons: as a thesis to complete my Master's degree at
                    the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy; and because I wanted to document the
                    issues and problems that AID had encountered, and make some policy and
                    operational recommendations that might influence AID to do a better job in the
                    future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you summarize the paper very briefly and indicate what
                        your recommendations were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: The paper is 86 pages long, so it will be hard to summarize it very
                    briefly. What I did was track the development of the democracy program from its
                    early beginnings in Central America through the point where every AID Regional
                    Bureau was doing it, albeit in very different ways given the different regions,
                    circumstances and viewpoints, and given the lack of any central AID leadership
                    in this sector. I pointed out the major issues and differences encountered in
                    developing this brand new program. One of the biggest problems was that AID had
                    virtually no staff with substantive expertise in this field, and was very slow
                    to develop it. Then I made about eight different recommendations involving
                    policy, program, staff development, how to prioritize activities within the
                    sector, and tasks for the new global office for democracy that was in the
                    process of being created as I wrote the paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the paper have any impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I got a letter from the Senior Advisor to the Assistant
                    Administrator for Program and Policy, thanking me for the paper and stating that
                    a number of my recommendations were being or would be adopted. To what extent
                    this happened or not I don't know. I suspect the letter was written in hopes of
                    keeping me quiet, since the paper in effect said that AID had really developed
                    the democracy program without knowing what it was doing, and it would have been
                    embarrassing to have this spread all over the Hill and elsewhere. The general
                    impression I have is that the recommendations may have had some useful impact,
                    but that for the most part AID was too understaffed and underfunded to really
                    carry out most of them fully.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's take a few minutes to wrap up the interview.
                        How do you assess your overall experiences in AID work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I thought it was, as Kennedy said back in 1963, “a proud and
                    lively” career. At that time, like others, I felt very involved and idealistic
                    about turning the world around in short order. Certainly the work we did was
                    important, and certainly it was interesting. There were always different sectors
                    that one had to try to master to some degree or other. To me, as an intellectual
                    dilettante, I never got tired of that, and I particularly enjoyed things like
                    working with the academics on the democracy strategies. There were arid spells
                    along the way, of course. Certainly I should not have stayed in Near East DP for
                    nine years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a problem with the way the personnel system
                        operated, constantly having to move on in the earlier days before you really
                        got established. You had nine years in one place, but you were locked in
                        there and in the other cases you weren't there long enough. So, you said in
                        one sense that the personnel system was not very effective in using its
                        talented people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I don't think anybody's ever had anything very good to say about
                    the AID personnel system, but at the same time, they were just responding to
                    pressures that came from elsewhere in terms of RIFs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RIFs and the Obey Amendment and one thing or another. And
                        reorganizations and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. I don't think that the personnel system had much to do with
                    reorganizations. That would be a new Administrator or a new theory coming from
                    somewhere. My career certainly does not look like the average Foreign Service
                    Officer's career, where he spends two to four years in one country and then goes
                    to another country for about the same time, interspersed with assignments in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your assignments were all very different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, but I didn't mind that. The Joint Commission job was an interesting
                    one, but I have no passion for the Middle East really. I was happy to move to
                    Latin America when I was moved. I was sorry to have to move out of it and I was
                    glad to get back to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any universal lessons which stand out in your mind after
                        all this time working on all these different kinds of programs in different
                        parts of the world? In terms of what leads to effective programs and so
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SELLAR: If you're asking particularly about my thoughts on what leads to an
                    effective program, that would have to be a long answer, because there's so much
                    analysis that really needs to go into a development project or program before
                    you can have any assurance that it's going to be effective, especially in the
                    long run. I think the agency itself went through a period of education where it
                    started out really just worrying about project feasibility analysis,
                    particularly in the capital projects, and then moved into the more heavily
                    technical assistance, the softer sides. There were always issues in
                    institutional development: whether one could achieve any lasting change by just
                    taking a piece of the government, one ministry, and making it sort of a shining
                    example of how things should work for a while, but meanwhile you're going to see
                    pervasive incompetence and corruption everywhere else. Eventually that is going
                    to drown out that one shining example, particularly since in many cases,
                    although there would have been provision for indigenization of the project,
                    after a certain point local capabilities tended to diminish. In many cases we
                    put returning participants into jobs too quickly and unrealistically expected
                    that we could withdraw senior, experienced people too quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially, are you saying that you needed a much more
                        long term approach and perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes, but we never really got to test that in too many cases, because of
                    some unwritten rule that a project wasn't supposed to be more than five years
                    long. Although it was common that there would be a follow-on project. I think
                    that the agency at one point realized that it was missing out somehow on
                    analyzing the local situation, and at that point hired a bunch of socialists and
                    anthropologists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To learn more about the local setting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Exactly. I think that was a step in the right direction. Although the
                    anthropologists, I think, were a lot less useful than the sociologists, because
                    they tended to plunge into one village and say that I need to stay here for five
                    years before I really understand anything, and then it will probably be
                    different in all of the other villages anyway. So, although there may have been
                    some truth to this, it wavery hard to build a program on that. The thing that I
                    think we failed to do, most of the time, was to really take into account how
                    ineffectual and corrupt the governments were. That was something I think was
                    brought out by writers like Robert Klitgaard, who was writing on Africa. His
                    most famous book is Tropical Gangsters. That book really laid it out. Those
                    problems are being addressed to some degree by the democracy program now, but in
                    most cases we cannot do full-fledged civil service reform projects. We have to
                    leave it to World Bank, and sometimes they do it and sometimes they don't. I
                    think that's a very important constraint that we did not address early on. I
                    think the projects did work better, certainly if they had local involvement and
                    awareness of the local culture. There was a time when we just dropped things on
                    them from on high.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I remember seeing one project that was particularly bad on my first trip to
                    Central America. It was a training program to teach people, I guess it may have
                    had something to do with sanitation skills. They had a modern American kitchen
                    in there with electric ranges and running water and all the things that 98
                    percent of the people in the country didn't have. One rather dazed looking
                    Nicaraguan stood in the middle of it trying to explain what it was all about.
                    That was egregiously bad project design, and AID, I think, fairly quickly moved
                    beyond that in terms of sophistication. But it's hard for me to say, because I
                    never looked back at anything I'd been working on, five or ten years later.</p>
                <p>I did have a chance to look back at what we'd been doing in Nepal for 20 years in
                    that one evaluation I told you about. But, normally I didn't do that sort of
                    thing, so I honestly can't tell you how much of our program worked and how much
                    of it didn't. Certainly in the human development area the training has to have
                    done some good. Although there's a funny story about how we set up a crackerjack
                    statistical unit to work in Iran when we still had an Iran program, to improve
                    the data that everybody always assumed we had, but which in fact we didn't have.
                    Then Iran had its revolution and the statistical unit disappeared, only however
                    to emerge virtually intact in Turkey. So, our objective was to improve the
                    statistic capability in Iran and wound up being in Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the people just moved over there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Yes. Our objective was accomplished, but in another country. Was this
                    success or failure? Also, I don't know how many of the people that we trained
                    were actually able to use their skills and did or did not become part of the
                    problem themselves. I've heard people, even very recently, talk about that
                    problem. I went to a session over in Rosslyn at the Tulane Graduate School's
                    program here. They had some of their students there. One guy from Africa was
                    saying quite candidly, what choices do I have? Do I try to stay here or in the
                    developed world? Do I go back to my country and if I do, you know, I'll just
                    have to become part of the system. So I guess your question initially was, what
                    was my assessment of what had worked and hadn't worked. I'm giving you a sort of
                    jumbled answer, but it's the best I can do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are so many issues that are involved and you can
                        expand on it. Would you say, looking back over the AID and the Foreign
                        Assistance Program, that it made a difference in international development
                        or would you say, as some people say, that the money just evaporated and it
                        didn't do anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>SELLAR: I think it made a difference. I mean, you look at the World Bank
                    statistics on improvement in human welfare over the past three decades: Health
                    indicators, education indicators, per capita GNP, and so forth. There definitely
                    has been a significant improvement in most parts of the world. I guess Africa is
                    kind of the laggard, but there's even some improvement there in some cases now.
                    Nobody knows how to disaggregate how much of the improvement is attributable to
                    the IBRD, to the U.S., to other donors, to the host country and so on, but as
                    one of the major donors, I don't see why we can't take our share of the credit
                    for the improvements. I don't think that our program was noticeably worse than
                    other donor programs. I think it was much better than the U.N. program and
                    different from the World Bank program. They're sort of a big battleship, if you
                    will, or aircraft carrier type program. Huge, but very hard to turn around or
                    change. We are more of a light cruiser or a destroyer and had more flexibility
                    and more agility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what areas do you think AID has been most innovative,
                        if any, over the years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, certainly we got an awful lot of credit for the Green Revolution. I
                    think that's deserved; we supported a lot of the research that was done at the
                    International Rice Institute. That had, of course, a very major impact in terms
                    of grain production in India and Bangladesh, and turned them around from being
                    heavy importers to being at least self-sufficient, even exporters in good years.
                    I think that the claims that were made for the child survival program as it was
                    publicized under Peter McPherson, were justifiable. This package that we
                    developed of oral rehydration saved millions of lives, and certainly other
                    medical programs that we did saved more millions of lives in terms of smallpox
                    eradication and huge reductions in measles and some of the other diseases that
                    killed so many children. Those are the two that come to mind. And we certainly
                    have contributed through our family planning programs to reductions in
                    population growth, a very important matter. Then, there are many other smaller
                    examples.</p>
                <p>I know that the democracy program, which is much more recent, has had some real
                    impact. There are other donors doing it, but I think we did lead the way. The
                    paper that I wrote on our experience, although used on the Hill to great effect,
                    was actually written for the Development Assistance Committee at the OECD,
                    because they were getting interested in democracy aid and wanted to know what
                    we'd learned. One job I had as a consultant after returning from AID was to
                    assess the validity of the Nepal democracy strategy and recommend any changes,
                    and also to set up indicators for measuring progress of the program. That
                    obviously involved finding out what the other donors were doing, and the Danes
                    had a pretty substantial program. So you would find some other countries doing
                    it. Of course, once the World Bank got over its hangup about political
                    interventions, they were doing things that contributed to democracy. I think it
                    got picked up on by most of the Regional Banks, and private organizations were
                    supported and able to do more than they had done before in human rights and a
                    whole number of areas.</p>

                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you have any final concluding remarks you want to
                        add to this in wrapping up your experience or your thoughts about
                        development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SELLAR: Well, I think that my experience was, on the whole, a positive one. I
                    look back on my career and I feel that I was lucky enough to be at various times
                    on the cutting edge of something, particularly with the PVOs and with the
                    democracy program, which made it very rewarding. Even the routine work of
                    reviewing projects and programs and trying to get them approved was interesting
                    most of the time. I would have preferred to have spent less time in Near East DP
                    and more time in some other places. I think that the Obey experience did affect
                    my career and my attitude somewhat adversely. But I feel that I was moderately
                    successful and have some accomplishments I can point to. I also feel that, when
                    I decided in graduate school that development was going to be one of the great
                    tasks of my generation, that I was right. In fact, I felt we might be done by
                    now, but obviously we're not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, that's a good thought for us to conclude with.
