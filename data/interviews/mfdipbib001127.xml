                <p>AMBASSADOR MICHAEL E. STERNER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 2, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about your
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well my childhood was spent both on the East Coast of the United States
                    and the West Coast. I came back and went to boarding school in Newport, Rhode
                    Island, and then Harvard College, and when I got out of Harvard —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get out of Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That was 1951. When I got out of Harvard, I got a job with the
                    Arabian-American Oil Company in Saudi Arabia and that really was the beginning
                    of a life-long interest in and specialization in Middle Eastern Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I went to Dhahran in the first instance but I also spent about six
                    months in as Ra's at Tannurah which is where the refinery is located. Then I
                    spent about a year on the pump stations on Tapline which takes oil from the
                    eastern part of Saudi Arabia to a port near Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aramco is a very important factor in American foreign
                        relations. It's a unique organization—I might add just for the record, that
                        I served myself on my second tour from 1958-1960 in Dhahran, so I'm familiar
                        with some of this. Could you tell a little about your staffing and how you
                        related to the Saudis at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>STERNER: It was a fascinating first job for me. This was a period when there was
                    the largest American presence in Aramco because shortly afterwards the company
                    began to, Arabize its labor force, to bring in both qualified Saudis who were of
                    course very hard to find for many jobs, but also Palestinians who were refugees
                    at the time and therefore some of them very well qualified. But when I was
                    there, there were about 15,000 Americans doing just everything. They were the
                    geologists, of course, the refinery managers, but they also were the clerks, the
                    maintenance people, the air conditioning people. My own job was on the
                    government relations staff. Our job was to conduct the company's business with
                    various elements of the Saudi Government. At the top level it was conducted by
                    people like Floyd Ohliger and Tom Barger who were responsible for concession
                    affairs and dealings with the King and his ministers. At my level as a junior
                    employee of the company it was clearing things through customs and later on when
                    I was on the Tapline, keeping the affairs of the little pump station amicable
                    with the local Saudi governor in that area. That consisted of building water
                    wells for the tribes, keeping the local amir supplied with certain things we
                    were obligated to do, making sure that he provided police protection and that
                    kind of thing. It was a wonderful first job. Looking back on it, I was a
                    bachelor at the time, therefore without responsibilities, and we worked seven
                    days a week in those days because there wasn't much else to do on your day off,
                    and every six weeks you got a week off, which meant you could travel anywhere in
                    the Middle East. So I went to Baghdad, Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut, and took
                    trips up into the mountains of Lebanon many times. It was just a wonderful
                    experience. I ended up feeling that though I probably did not want to go back to
                    spend a career in the oil company, where one tended to keep going back to just
                    Saudi Arabia, I was very interested in the Middle East and wanted to pursue a
                    career somehow in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question about the attitude as you saw it, of
                        Aramco, the upper echelon of Aramco towards the Saudis, because it struck
                        me, and I'm going somewhat ahead to my time— that Aramco had the idea that
                        let's turn this over—we're going to lose out if we get into a nose to nose
                        confrontation with the Saudis and let's give them as much as they can absorb
                        whereas when you talk about British Petroleum or any of the other companies
                        that were dealing in the area the whole idea was no, no, never ever. And, of
                        course, these all ended up with nationalization. It was a much bumpier road.
                        Did you feel that? Were you under instruction or why did they have this
                        idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I didn't realize it fully until later on when I had a broader
                    perspective of oil affairs in other countries. The extent to which Aramco was
                    perceived by other people in the oil industry as being very forward in granting
                    concessions to the host government—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or seen as a wimp—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STERNER: Or seen as a wimp—however you want to describe it. I got there shortly
                    after the deal for a fifty-fifty split which of course set a precedent for
                    people like the British who had equity oil interests all over the Middle East.
                    It was very hard for them to maintain much tougher earlier type arrangements. I
                    got the full flavor of this when I subsequently got into the diplomatic service
                    and then was sent as my first post to Aden and the place was full of colonial
                    Brits who still held Aramco responsible for the erosion of their interests, as
                    they saw it, in places like Iran. It even affected my personal relations, their
                    knowing that I had a background with Aramco. There were a lot of hard
                    feelings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into the Foreign Service? You worked for
                        Aramco until 1953.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: When I came back I was subject to the draft. This was the tail end of
                    the Korean War. I finally was drafted in 1954. I spent two years in the U.S.
                    Army as an enlisted man. While I was in the Army, I looked at various career
                    alternatives and decided that the diplomatic service interested me. I took the
                    exams and fortunately it was a period when I had plenty of time. I was stationed
                    in the United States which helped. I was, in fact, right across the river in
                    Fort Myer, Virginia for much of my time. So I took the exams and when I got out
                    I guess I'd done the written but still had the orals when I was discharged from
                    the Army. My Army career had nothing to do with the Middle East, but I did have
                    an interesting job. I was loaned as a political officer, so called, to Air Force
                    intelligence who were involved in targeting H-bombs all over the place which was
                    a new experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not the first man. Robert Duemling who was later
                        ambassador to Suriname was a Naval Officer targeting nuclear weapons strikes
                        against China in Japan at the same period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: An awful lot of it was going at the time. My job was to figure out how
                    to position the bomb blast so as to wipe out the communist party apparatus in
                    various Eastern European countries. At the same time, we were supposed to jiggle
                    the zero point so that it wouldn't break all the stained glass windows in some
                    famous Cathedral. The job had its Strangelovian features.</p>
                <p>When I got out I wanted to pursue my Middle Eastern interests and go back out
                    there. I therefore came into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize the junior officers? You went into
                        a class didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1956. Could you characterize the class you came into?
                        What kind of people were they? What was their outlook? How did they approach
                        the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: It was a hopeful and enthusiastic period for foreign affairs. Looking
                    back on my college classmates, quite a few came into the Foreign Service and the
                    CIA, and the Junior Management Program of the Civil Service and otherwise
                    entered government service. Public service was in high regard at the time,
                    certainly in comparison with later periods. I think that enthusiasm was
                    reflected in my entering class. It was a rather large class as I remember it, 35
                    or 40 or something like that. I was on the whole regarded with quite a bit of
                    interest because very few of my classmates had anything in their background as
                    exotic as having lived in Saudi Arabia. I knew what I wanted to do, I was
                    interested even then in language training. They were much more uncertain what
                    shape their career might take. But I was age-wise in the median I guess, 27. I
                    still see some of those fellows. Some of them are still in the Service. Bill
                    Brown is our ambassador in Israel at the moment. He was one of my classmates.
                    Jim Lowenstein got of the Service about when I did and is now a consultant here
                    in town. Also one of my classmates, Walt Cutler, is now President of Meridian
                    House—one of your interviewees I see. I think the mood was very good in that
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a career you were going into, not a job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That was very much the feeling for everybody. And it was an interesting
                    period from another point of view because it was really the beginning of the
                    consciousness of the Third World emerging out of World War II. Instead of the
                    pre-war pattern of training you in French or Spanish and then expecting you to
                    go almost anywhere, they were beginning to be interested in people who wanted to
                    focus on a given part of the world, and were willing to learn some of the
                    difficult third world languages. It was a new dimension which increased the
                    enthusiasm for the Service. When we came in we had two major world crises, which
                    also provided a lot of excitement. The Soviet invasion of Hungary occurred while
                    our class was in training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the fall of 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: It was in the fall of '56 and there was also the second Middle East
                    crisis, the Suez crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell us about your first assignment and what you
                        were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>STERNER: I was sent to Aden. It was a small two-officer post. Bill Crawford was
                    the Consul and I was the Vice Consul. It was very much a straight consular
                    consulate for that period of time and I did all the consular work. You know, we
                    got drunken American seamen out of jail, and we repatriated people, and so
                    on...but it had some interesting political dimensions to it. We covered Yemen
                    because nobody else did. We had no post in Yemen in those days. Nothing much had
                    happened for a long time in Yemen. It was one of those remote places in the
                    world that nobody ever got to and nobody had any perceived interest in. But all
                    of a sudden, there was a sort of mini-crisis in the Eisenhower Administration
                    when it became aware that the Soviets were interested in the place. This was
                    peak cold war period and people got interested in areas where the Soviets were
                    making any kind of inroads. At the time the Crown Prince of Yemen, Badr ibn
                    Ahmad, began to consort with the Soviets, invited a Soviet delegation to come
                    and look at oil concessions possibilities, got some Soviet engineers to come
                    down, and made a trip to Moscow, as I remember. Well, this all astonished
                    Washington, and made them realize that Yemen, a place they'd never heard of
                    before, was indeed one of the most strategic countries in the world. Bill
                    Crawford began to get instructions to go up there and cultivate these Yemenis
                    and try to point out they were doing the wrong thing. So the Cold War sort of
                    came to the Consul in Aden and Yemen. We also had at one point responsibility
                    for British Somaliland. That was almost entirely consular in nature—just to
                    visit every now and then, make sure our citizens were all right, issue
                    passports, visas, etc. Aden itself was rather a large territory if you wanted to
                    take it seriously. There was the city of Aden, which was a British Crown Colony,
                    and beyond it you had both the Western Protectorate and the Hadhramaut, sizeable
                    areas to roam about in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Aden and around, because I've
                        never really fully understood it, and also why that area remains a hard core
                        Marxist regime? Why in the Arab world which seems so impervious to this sort
                        of business, and how did it happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That's a very good question. I have no satisfactory answer for it, and
                    certainly my experience in Aden at that time would not have suggested a colonial
                    background that was very different from many other parts of the Arab world. When
                    we were there, it was an early stage in the growth of Arab nationalist movements
                    in the colony itself. But Gamal Abdul Nasser was at the peak of his popularity
                    at the time. This naturally had an impact even in far off Aden. The British were
                    beginning to have to cope with nationalist pressures and movements. There was
                    quite a bit of political ferment in those days but it was all peaceful and only
                    later became violent. When Curt Jones was Consul ten years later it was really
                    dangerous. He had to go around with guards and there were grenades going off in
                    restaurants. It was quite serious. That was not happening when we were there.

                <p>STERNER: William R. Crawford. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are several Crawfords.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: He was later our Ambassador in Yemen and Cyprus. He tried to be in touch
                    with some of the Adenese who were beginning to become nationalists and
                    opposition leaders. This caused a bit of heat at times between ourselves and the
                    British. They felt we should not have contact with some of these people because
                    we were giving them enhanced credence and respectability, and we had to sort
                    that out with the British and make it clear that we had a responsibility to
                    Washington to keep them informed about what was going on. On the whole our
                    relations were really very good with the British Government down there. Aden is
                    a magnificent natural harbor. It had a large British Petroleum refinery. There
                    was a lot of sea traffic. The port was always full of ships that had transited
                    the Suez Canal, were refueling and picking up supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Suez Canal open at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: The Suez Canal was indeed open at that point. It was the '67 war when it
                    had a prolonged blockage. Unlike the Aden Colony where there was a very direct
                    and immediate British rule, the British in the Protectorate areas relied on a
                    loose structure of advisors and tribal rulers who were linked to the British
                    individually in protectorate treaties with the understanding that they were not
                    to deal with foreign powers, that the British had commercial rights and
                    privileges, and in return for that, they offered the Sheiks protection . Every
                    now and then the British would feel that one of the rulers was consorting with
                    the wrong people—Yemenis, or going off on his own and required a bit of
                    punishment, at which point a Lancaster bomber would lumber off from Aden airport
                    and usually after a warning so the little town could be evacuated, they'd drop a
                    few bombs to blow up the Sheik's palace. That was the manner of British control
                    which had been going on for a long while.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Sure. That was the way to get the tribes in line. On the whole it worked
                    and it was not the hinterland that ended up posing a problem for the British. It
                    was the underground movement in Aden itself.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>STERNER: In our time the movement in Aden was not strong enough to be seen as a
                    threat to British rule, but all of us could speculate from the impact that
                    Nasser and other Arab nationalist movements were having. You remember the Qasim
                    revolution in Iraq happened about this time as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was July 14, 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Quite right. We were down there about that time. The British and
                    American intervention in Jordan and Lebanon, respectively, also in the summer
                    and fall of 1958. It looked as if western interests were on the run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you had the same thing we saw in Dhahran and
                        Bahrain that is, the marketplaces were filled with pictures of Nasser on
                        thermoses, on cups, on pictures, everywhere you went, Nasser was the
                        equivalent of a sort of God. This was in the marketplace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Absolutely. I remember walking through the streets of the bazaar in
                    Aden, and when Nasser was giving a major speech you could walk from place to
                    place in town and not miss a word because every radio in the entire town was
                    tuned in. He really had the power to stir these people up. So one could
                    speculate, coming back to your question, that this would be a tide that would
                    affect western interests in a far-off place like Aden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also at the time, and I'd like your feeling on this, as
                        Americans who were interested in foreign policy, we saw nationalist tides as
                        being the wave of the future and we were not sure what was going to happen.
                        We were both for and against them, sort of an ambivalent feeling. One, they
                        might louse up our problems in some areas, but at the same time we were for
                        anti-colonialism and wanted these people to emerge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I think that was very much it. We thought this was something wholesome,
                    a new phase of welcome self-determination in the world, providing they didn't
                    start consorting with Moscow. That was a big proviso because I think
                    subsequently we lacked confidence that these people had the ability to make
                    deals with Moscow and not become the creatures of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you went into Arabic training. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, I left early since it was short of the normal two-year junior
                    assignment in a post. I spent eighteen months in Aden, then went up to a class
                    that was opening in Arabic in Beirut. I'd indicated my interest in this. I had
                    learned some Arabic during my stay in Saudi Arabia but not very systematically
                    because I had not had any training opportunities there. The FSI course had
                    recently moved from Washington to Beirut, which was an enormous asset. It was
                    great to be in the spot, and Beirut itself was a fascinating place. It was just
                    coming out of the crisis of 1958 when I arrived. I got there in October of 1958
                    and the marines had just withdrawn. The Chehab Government had been installed,
                    but there were still the occasional explosion going off somewhere in the city.
                    But once it quieted down it was great being a student at that time. In contrast
                    to the embassy officers who were very busy with day to day political
                    responsibilities, the students had an opportunity to look into the causes of the
                    conflict, to talk with the Lebanese in a way that political officers could not.
                    On the other hand, we were constantly meeting with the political officers
                    because we were a resource that they could draw on. We had leisure to get to
                    parts of Lebanon that they simply didn't have time to get to. So we could travel
                    around a bit, and had a great time, learned some Arabic apparently. Looking back
                    on the tragedy of Lebanon, it was a sort of wholesome period too. Both the
                    Muslims and the Christians who had gone through this period seemed to derive a
                    healthy lesson from the 1958 experience, and to be determined that this sort of
                    thing would never happen again. Of course, they were so wrong about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time of unity. You did not see this thing as
                        being the next Belfast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: No, it was hard to predict that it would go in that direction. Of course
                    we were all conscious of the deep divisions in Lebanese society, which had been
                    exacerbated by the Nasser phenomenon and by Chamoun's stubborn effort to
                    continue in office when it was quite clear it was against the constitution.
                    There was much blame on both sides. The Nasserists were very aggressive, did not
                    have the Lebanese interests primarily in mind. They were Arab nationalists;
                    didn't care what happened to the Christian minorities and other people who
                    didn't share their enthusiasm for Arab nationalism. But when Chehab came in,
                    there was a moment of hope that the Lebanese, Muslim and Christian, would see
                    that this involvement in broader Arab affairs would end up being a tragedy for
                    Lebanon, and that somehow they had to preserve the comity of their own little
                    nation. Their prosperity, their political health depended on that, and for a
                    while they did that. Then it of course broke down later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could talk a little about the people
                        taking Arabic with you? You're an Arabist, and the Arabists in the Foreign
                        Service are often accused of being a particular breed. At that time, how did
                        you see it and how did you see Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STERNER: It's hard to tell exactly who was motivated to get into the course. Most
                    of the people in the course had by this time either had a post or like myself, a
                    job perhaps concerning the Middle East, or post-graduate study in the Middle
                    East. Arabic training represented a rather major investment. Arabic is perhaps
                    not the toughest language in the world for westerners but it certainly harder
                    that your average European language. You not only have to spend a good bit of
                    time to get your teeth into it, but then you have to make a commitment to work
                    at it after that. And you can't really do that unless you go to Arabic-speaking
                    countries and that requires a career commitment in that direction. So we had
                    people who were interested in either the Middle East as a culture, or,
                    motivating many of us, including myself, what looked like a good career path
                    from the point of view of professional challenges. After all, you study Amharic,
                    and there's only one place to go to speak Amharic. Arabic had the enormous
                    advantage of having a dozen posts you could go to in those days, and even more
                    now, where you could speak the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also it was rather an exciting time as far as the Arab
                        world was concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Very exciting. All these things were happening that we've been talking
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FSO's like to go where the action is. We work better, and
                        usually move ahead faster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That's right. There was much of that spirit. In my class there were only
                    three students. That was a bit smaller than average. But there were plenty of
                    candidates in those days. Now, on the Arab-Israel problem, you've got to bear in
                    mind that we were neophytes at this point, all young folks, who had not had
                    concentrated experience in dealing with the Arab-Israel issue. As one who had
                    never visited Israel, and who had a private sector job in one Arab country, and
                    a diplomatic assignment in another Arab country, at a time when Arab nationalism
                    was a fever particularly among youth in the Arab world, and particularly at
                    Aramco where I had made friends with many Palestinians, I was, I'm sure,
                    sympathetic to the Arab point of view about the Arab-Israel problem. I frame it
                    in those terms because, having subsequently spent a large part of my
                    professional career on this issue, it's hard for me to remember exactly what my
                    feelings and attitudes were at the time. But, I certainly must have felt that
                    the Palestinians had had a grave injustice done to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might break in here to emphasize the point that so many
                        of our intellectual and professional element we were dealing with were so
                        often Palestinian, because these were the best educated people throughout
                        the Arab world. It would be almost equivalent to working in California with
                        the Armenians, and you didn't have a chance to hear the Turkish side of the
                        Armenian-Turkish thing. As far as you were concerned you were hearing one
                        side, which had a very good case. Both sides have a good case, but these
                        were people who had been kicked out of their homes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>STERNER: Absolutely. To give you an example of how vivid that sort of thing can
                    be, I was in Aramco at one of the pump stations where there were only a handful
                    of people there on the Tapline. Each of those stations had a little hospital and
                    the hospitals were run either by Lebanese or Palestinians. The station where I
                    was at for quite a bit of time, the hospital doctor was a Palestinian who was a
                    wonderful guy, and to this day remains a personal friend. I spent many an
                    evening with him talking about the Arab-Israel problem and, his experiences. He
                    owned a house in Jaffa, which he was no longer free to go to and which an
                    Israeli had just moved into, and there was enormous bitterness. Some of that
                    certainly conveyed itself to me as a vivid experience. Another example is that I
                    wanted to make a trip to Jerusalem which I'd never seen. My interpreter—I didn't
                    have enough Arabic in those days to deal with the tribes, and I had a Sudanese
                    interpreter assigned to me—and I took an overland trip to Jerusalem through
                    Jordan. In fact we hitch-hiked for most of the journey. We got a tanker truck
                    that was rolling along on the IPC line that stopped...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just want to switch tape sides.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, you were saying...</p>
                <p>STERNER: We were hitchhiking to Jerusalem. Somehow we got there. Since my friend
                    didn't have much money, we stayed in a very simple hotel in Jerusalem—no
                    westerners—just other Arabs. It was this kind of immediate experience that you
                    have as a young man that wouldn't happen to you at a later stage of life, that
                    made terribly deep impressions on your way of thinking and on your emotional
                    outlook at that time. So I'm sure I was sympathetic to the Arab cause. One thing
                    that tended to give me a little balance, perhaps two things, I was brought up in
                    New York City. Therefore, as a matter of course I knew many Jews. I put it in
                    those terms because if you come from Omaha, Nebraska it would have been a
                    different experience. I therefore had a consciousness of what the creation of
                    the State of Israel meant to the Jewish community. But I would say that it was
                    not nearly as vivid and immediate as this experience I was living in the Arab
                    world. But I wanted to visit Israel. In those days you could take your car and
                    drive down to Israel from Lebanon. You went through the border point at Ras
                    Naqurah. It was not long afterwards that the border was closed and you could no
                    longer make that trip. We had a little Morris Minor convertible and so we...</p>

                    border in those days was an eerie experience. There was a four kilometers
                    stretch of no-man's land between the Lebanese outposts and the Israelis. You
                    couldn't drive in Israel with Lebanese diplomatic plates so you went to a
                    Lebanese garage and you rented a set of American plates. You could drive in
                    Israel with American plates. Then in the middle of this no-man's land—you could
                    feel the binoculars from both sides peering down at you—you got out with
                    screwdriver and pliers and unscrewed the Lebanese diplomatic plates, threw them
                    in the trunk, put on the other plates, and drove on. This was the beginning of
                    an awareness of how effective the Israelis were in public relations. We checked
                    into our hotel in Haifa, and the next morning the phone rang and it said, Hello,
                    I'm Shlomo, or whoever, and I'm part of whatever government agency it was to
                    welcome tourists, and we understand you are down here from Lebanon. We hope you
                    have a very good time and we don't want to impose in any way, but would you in
                    the course of your trip like to be invited into the homes of some Israeli
                    people? We said of course we'd enjoy that very much. And so we were. We met
                    people who were genuinely warm and hospitable, and, of course, we got an
                    exposure to the other point of view. Certainly we came away with the impression
                    that Israel was an extraordinarily vibrant, and in those days, a very strong
                    place. There was enormous conviction that they were a frontier land and it was
                    imbued with idealism much of which unfortunately has faded. Today Israeli
                    society is deeply polarized. That was not the case in those days. We went to a
                    couple of kibbutzim which were very interesting, and that visit, although
                    lasting only two weeks, also had a good deal of impact. I was glad I did it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I was in the political section. I think I may have been the only
                    language officer at the time. I covered the press, did a daily report on what
                    was important in the press, which was good for keeping my Arabic up. I also
                    covered internal affairs which was not very active since there wasn't a great
                    deal of political opposition to Nasser, but there was the Arab Socialist Union,
                    labor union affairs, and I developed contacts in those areas. I was also asked
                    to cover the Arab League, and follow the intra-Arab. I did not have any
                    responsibilities for U.S.-Egyptian relations. The political counselor handled
                    that and other things were handled by other political officers. African affairs
                    for example were very lively at that time because Cairo had welcomed the exiled
                    nationalist movements from several African countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wearing both an Arab and African hat at the same

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>STERNER: That's right. And you had these leaders—for example, a major part of the
                    Algerian revolutionary leadership was in Cairo at the time, and we had an
                    officer assigned to stay in touch with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first embassy. Could you give an impression
                        of your idea of how it seemed to be run? The Ambassador and some of the
                        personalities there? This is an important era we're dealing with—the
                        Egyptians who were important players at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I had the pleasure of serving under two very competent ambassadors who
                    were also very different ambassadors. The first was Fred Reinhardt, a career
                    generalist who was not experienced in the Arab world but who had risen to senior
                    rank. I think he had been Counselor of the Department before coming to Cairo. He
                    later was Ambassador to Italy. He came at the end of the Eisenhower
                    Administration, and as it turned out had a very short assignment in Cairo,
                    really no fault of his own. It's just that Kennedy came in with the idea of
                    taking distinguished area specialists and putting them in as Ambassadors.
                    Galbraith went to India, Reischauer to Japan, and we got John Badeau, who was
                    really a remarkable man. He started out as a Presbyterian Minister as a young
                    man in the Middle East and then had been for years the President of the American
                    University of Cairo. He spoke fluent Arabic and knew Arab culture as really few
                    people did. Many of us as professionals were worried that John would prove to be
                    a sort of dreamy academic type who leave classified telegrams in the taxicab, or
                    something like that. And we worried about parochialism. In fact, I think Badeau
                    was superior Ambassador from a professional point of view as well as knowing
                    everything about Egypt. He had a very broad view and had respect for and
                    confidence in the Foreign Service officers who were manning the Embassy. He well
                    knew, as I well knew, that he knew much more about Egypt than I did, but he
                    didn't try to do the internal political reporting on Egypt. He let me do that.
                    So it was professionally a good experience and I think we had good leadership in
                    those days. Looking back on it, I think we were going through a period
                    where...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the 1960-64 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That's right, in Egypt. As a career service and a foreign policy
                    mechanism, we had too many people following too many things. Our political
                    section was really quite large. There were people assigned to do nothing but
                    follow the Algerians, to follow what the various African Liberation movements
                    were doing. I was doing telegrams each day on what the press was saying. I think
                    in retrospect that we overdid it in that period, and that our staffing could
                    have been about one half of what we had to cover adequately what was important
                    from the point of view of real American interests. The inflation of personnel
                    during that period caused a lot of problems later on when we attempted to shrink
                    the service and it caused, as we all remember from our respective careers, a lot
                    of unhappiness and grief and management problems about what you do about this
                    big bulge of senior people.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm afraid we're doing somewhat of the same thing. We're
                        having vast changes in Eastern Europe and we seem to be throwing people from
                        the Foreign Service into those posts. I'm not sure what more people
                        reporting are going to do. This is looking from the sidelines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: You may be absolutely right. In some areas such our commercial
                    section—that's a legitimate area expansion—but I think you're absolutely right
                    that beefing up the political section ought to go real slow. There will
                    certainly be more to report, but you don't need six times the number of people
                    that you had formally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were reporting on internal politics. How did you find
                        Nasser—fully in charge, or were there problems? Or was there much to report
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: You could basically satisfy the requirements of a Presidential view of
                    American interests in Egypt by saying Nasser has got this place under wraps and
                    it's not likely to change any time soon. That was the long and short of it. But
                    of course there were numbers of people at lower echelons who were interested in
                    the fascinating detail as it were, perhaps too much so. There were too many
                    people back here in Washington creating a demand for all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nasser stood like a colossus there. How did you view
                        Nasser yourself? Here you are, a junior officer, but also what were you
                        absorbing from the Embassy? Because there was a tremendous amount of concern
                        about him and the Soviets and feeling that he was really a menace to our
                        interests in some ways, and at the same time there were other feelings. How
                        did you all feel about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well, I think during my period there, 1960-64, which was nearly five
                    years, I witnessed a major change in attitude. In 1960 our feeling about Nasser
                    was really quite positive and hopeful. We had actually pulled his bacon out of
                    the fire in 1956 as you remember.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Suez Crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, and more than that, when Kennedy came in 1961, there was even more
                    of a positive spin imparted to U.S.-Egyptian relations. He and his advisers,
                    Walt Rostow, McGeorge Bundy, were all saying, “Let us select important regional
                    countries, even though these leaders have given us problems in the past and make
                    an effort to work with them.” For example, our economic assistance programs
                    began in a big way, particularly PL 480 Food Assistance. We tried to play a role
                    in the World Bank and IMF that was favorable to Egyptian interests. All of that
                    gave a positive flavor to relations in the beginning. We made a major effort to
                    work with Nasser during this period. Then it gradually soured. And it soured
                    over a variety of issues. We disagreed with his attempt to destabilize other
                    countries with which we had close relations—Saudi Arabia for example. He was
                    openly calling for their downfall. In the case of Saudi Arabia, he welcomed to
                    Cairo some dissident princes who were openly advocating the overthrow of the
                    House of Saud. That was one issue. Secondly, there was the more immediate
                    problem of the Yemeni revolution which took place during this period. The Saudis
                    immediately launched an attempt to destroy the revolution. Nasser launched a
                    counter effort to make sure that it survived and there were some close
                    encounters between Egyptian forces and Saudi forces. At one point we sent a
                    squadron of airplanes based in Saudi Arabia to patrol the border, the northern
                    border of Yemen, and to warn Nasser that if he sought to extend his influence
                    into Saudi Arabia, he would come up against American determination to defend
                    Saudi Arabia. At the same time, the Arab-Israel problem was gradually heating
                    up. There had been a good period on this issue for quite a time. We had
                    enforced, as you remember, the Israeli evacuation from Elat and Gaza which
                    created a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations. Much to Eisenhower's credit he
                    didn't allow the Israelis to acquire any territory as a result of that war. That
                    impacted very well and the shadow of those things that the United States had
                    done served is well for quite a bit of time. But, slowly but surely our
                    relations began to unravel on this front as well. There were incidents in Gaza,
                    for example, mainly Palestinians trying to run across the border, and both on
                    Israel's eastern front and the demilitarized zone and in Gaza, there were
                    increasing incidents. The Israelis were periodically retaliating across the
                    borders, and in doing so, occasionally killing Syrians and Egyptians. Things
                    were heating up. I remember the Egyptian Ambassador back here in Washington
                    saying, “We've got to keep this problem in the icebox, keep it in the freezer”.
                    That was something that would have been good for U.S.-Egyptian relations, but it
                    couldn't be kept in the freezer. So by the time I left in 1964, we had a lot of
                    problems and there was a different tone to U.S.-Egyptian relations. We no longer
                    had confidence that Nasser could play the kind of stabilizing role that the
                    policy planners in 1960 envisioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back in 1964 to see just the other side of
                        this, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes. I came back to Washington and served on a number of country desks
                    in the old Near Eastern Division. To begin with, I worked on the UAR desk as it
                    was called then, reflecting the period of Syria-Egypt union, and then I worked
                    for Bill Brewer for a while on the Arabian peninsula desk, but did most of my
                    work in and around the Arab-Israel problem. I worked for Harry Symmes when he
                    was head of the NE division, when Roy Atherton came in as Deputy of the Near
                    Eastern Division I worked for him, and then when we all changed to a Country
                    Director structure I worked for Roy Atherton, who was Director of Israel and
                    Arab-Israel affairs. I was a sort of utility infielder in those days on
                    Arab-Israel issues—refugee affairs, Jordan water problems, the problem of
                    Jerusalem. It was an interesting period, but basically one which was completely
                    static as far as the Arab-Israel problem was concerned until 1967 produced the
                    new crisis. Quite clearly Nasser's prestige had begun to run down. He had to
                    think of something new to put himself back on the map. What better than a
                    repetition of 1956 which had served him so well a decade before. I think that
                    was a major factor in the new crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk before the '67 war. Let's talk about the period
                        that— In an interview I did with Dick Parker who was at our Embassy in Cairo
                        during part of this time talked about even there he could see the
                        relationship that President Lyndon Johnson and Nasser— I mean there was
                        almost something chemical there—that they really—the way they were two
                        similar figures—I mean in both size and looks almost—but there was
                        tremendous antipathy. Did you feel any of that where you were or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, we became conscious of the fact that. I would say that during the
                    Kennedy Administration we were essentially neutral on Arab-Israel affairs.
                    Kennedy certainly was not anti-Israeli in any way but on the other hand he
                    wanted to make a legitimate effort to resolve some of the problems in
                    Arab-Israel affairs and who prepared to put some U.S. muscle behind these
                    initiatives. Kennedy didn't have long enough for us to know how tough he might
                    have been. There was a change when Johnson came in but not one that was
                    immediately apparent but which became apparent in slow degrees. For one thing,
                    the back door connection between the White House and the Israeli Embassy became
                    much more important under Johnson. It partly had to do with personalities.
                    Johnson liked the Israeli Deputy Chief of Mission, Eppie Evron, who was with
                    this unofficial relationship with the President and his top White House
                    advisors. This had been going on under Kennedy, but it wasn't as prominent as it
                    became in the Johnson period. We became aware of it in the State Department. We
                    were not informed about these meetings, but knew they were taking place and you
                    could see the evidence. Certain things that we wanted to do were simply not
                    getting done and our senior people in the State Department were equally puzzled.
                    Johnson, had close relations with some big fund-raisers in the Democratic Party
                    who were Jewish—that's one aspect of it—but I don't think that was the main
                    thing. I think he found American Jews and Israelis sympatico and also had a
                    genuine sympathy for the Jewish experience in Israel. Johnson wasn't anti-Arab
                    but there just wasn't anyone in his entourage or among his friends who made him
                    feel the Arab point of view. I remember that Levi Eshkol, the Israeli Prime
                    Minister at the time, turned up in this country in the mid-sixties with a
                    shopping list which included Phantom aircraft which represented a quantum leap
                    in the level of armament we had provided Israel. The State Department's view was
                    that there were important things that we wanted in return, such as assurances on
                    Dimona...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dimona being the nuclear facility?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, which was of increasing concern to us because the Israelis would
                    not let us in to see the facility and there was a good deal of evidence that
                    they were surreptitiously importing uranium ore and not accounting for it. We
                    wanted them to sign the Non-proliferation Treaty, to put the Dimona facility
                    under IAEA safeguards, and to be more cooperative on the Jordan waters problem.
                    I can't remember the entire catalogue of things but these were what we wanted
                    done and our feeling was that aircraft should not be granted until we got some
                    of these things in return. But in essence we got very little. Eshkol came over,
                    went down to Johnson's ranch in Texas and they had a cozy meeting and the next
                    thing we knew the Israelis hadn't given us a damn thing on any of these fronts
                    but went home with Johnson's okay to provide phantoms. That began unfortunately
                    a pattern where we simply did not have the stick-to-itiveness and toughness and
                    endurance to stand down the Israelis in negotiations in which we had legitimate
                    interests that we wanted them to be responsive to. It was the beginning of a
                    pattern in which subsequent administrations—any administration which started to
                    take a hard line with the Israelis—the Israelis had total confidence that if
                    they just persisted and used their assets in Congress, that the President would
                    cave in four months, six months, eight months, whatever it took. And they've
                    been proved right for the most part over the years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I was a Desk Officer on the Arab-Israel problem and so was one of the
                    first people involved in setting up a Task Force on the seventh floor. Before
                    war broke out on June 5, 1967, there was a three-week period of diplomacy to try
                    to head off this conflict. You remember the sequence of events.</p>

                <p>STERNER: We were saying that the sequence of events right prior to the '67

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Nasser ordered troops into the Sinai about May 15, as I remember it, and
                    about three or four days later called on U Thant, then UN Secretary General, to
                    withdraw the UN buffer force that had been in the Sinai and keeping the peace
                    there. Then about the same time, or a few days later, Nasser announced closure
                    of the Strait of Aqaba to Israeli shipping. At that point I think almost
                    everybody felt that unless this thing could be defused very fast conflict was
                    inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Strait of Aqaba was where they were getting their
                        oil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Exactly. I can't tell you exactly what percentage but over the years
                    about 60 to 70 percent of Israeli oil requirements came from Iran and certainly
                    all that oil was coming into Elat. We were seized with trying to get the
                    Egyptians to stand down and to think of various face-saving ways where it might
                    be possible to prevent the conflict. We were, of course, worried about the
                    implications of a conflict. No one at the time that this thing was brewing had
                    any assurance that the Israelis could win this war in six days time. The
                    Egyptians seemed very confident and for all we knew could give the Israelis some
                    real trouble and we saw emerging out of that a very serious possibility of
                    U.S.-Soviet confrontation, the Soviets being committed to Egypt at that time and
                    ourselves to the Israelis. Even if we did not have such a confrontation, we saw
                    the possibility of regional conflict unraveling our interests in much of the
                    Arab world. So this was a really serious crisis for the United States. We of
                    course had intensive diplomacy with the Egyptians but not to much avail.
                    However, the Egyptians claimed that on the eve of the war, one of their top
                    people, Zakaria Mohieddine was on his way here and had the Israelis not attacked
                    might have defused the crisis. I tend to disbelieve this thesis because Nasser
                    was too committed in the eyes of his own people and the eyes of the Arab world
                    to the course of action he had taken. I think he wanted a conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an important point. Sometimes it is claimed that
                        this was some kind of bluff on the part of Nasser to posture, but at least
                        in your impression and the people you were dealing with, you didn't feel
                        that this was a bluff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: No, I don't think it was a bluff. Of course if he had been lucky enough
                    to get the Israelis to accept Egyptian control over their shipping and the right
                    to determine who used the Strait of Aqaba and the disbandment of the UNEF Force
                    in Sinai as a fait accompli and the reoccupation of Sinai with a large Egyptian
                    Army...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was never in the cards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: But this was never in the cards. And I think he had to know it. The real
                    error in judgment was what his military capability was in Sinai. And here I
                    think Abdul Hakim Amer, the Defense Minister and Commander of the Egyptian
                    Forces, probably oversold the Egyptian ability to stand up to the Israeli
                    offensive. No one knows exactly how Amer died. The official version is that he
                    committed suicide. Some people think he was poisoned by Nasser. My own feeling
                    is that he had plenty of reasons to commit suicide about, so that we need not
                    feel that explanation is totally implausible.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The other thing that we worked on during that period was to get the Israelis in
                    Tel Aviv to hold off from taking unilateral military action. We were telling
                    them that the international community could take effective action to protect
                    Israeli interests.We attempted during this period to form an international naval
                    squadron that would in effect patrol the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba
                    and insure freedom of shipping. Our own position of course was that the Gulf of
                    Aqaba was High Seas and the Egyptians had no right whatsoever to exclude the
                    Israelis or anyone else from transiting the Strait of Tiran. We didn't have many
                    takers among our allies and at the time war broke out we had commitments from
                    only the Netherlands and Costa Rica, if my memory serves, for contributions to
                    the naval force. Our European allies were not rushing to join us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't want to upset their interests because of oil
                        particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: That certainly, and also because they didn't like Washington's
                    pro-Israel policies. In the end, of course, the Israelis decided, number one,
                    that our diplomacy was not going to succeed and, number two, the longer he was
                    allowed to hold these positions, the tougher it was going to be to dislodge him.
                    And also, I think, they decided it would be much more beneficial to them to be
                    the ones to assert Israel's rights rather than the international community. They
                    had something to prove there and they certainly did prove it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having contact with the Israeli Embassy and the
                        Egyptian Embassy during this period of time? And how were they talking to
                        you and were you sitting in own meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: The Israelis were at first completely shocked that this had taken place.
                    Secondly, very determined that we should take action and do something about it.
                    The Egyptians on the other hand were full of bluster about the fact that they
                    had the rights to do this. This was Egyptian territory, the Sinai was Egyptian
                    territory, they waited eight years for the international community to do
                    something about the Arab-Israel problem, and this force had been there all this
                    time, and it was an unnatural phenomenon to have an international force. It was
                    the expected argumentation to support their positions. We were not at all
                    persuaded at any point of the legitimacy of what the Egyptians were doing and
                    did not think they had a good case in international law. In my opinion, Nasser
                    was the aggressor in this war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any pressure or any great demands for

                <p>STERNER: Yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>STERNER: We were making almost daily trips to the Hill and I was often the
                    sidekick of some senior official who did the testifying. I remember having my
                    arms full with maps and documents. Congressional committees were very worried at
                    this period, as was the Executive Branch, and very impatient to know what the
                    Administration was doing to resolve this crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see the Six Day War and its outcome? As you
                        were involved in these various groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: We were enormously surprised by Nasser's action, initially very worried.
                    We were also disappointed with the Israelis, that they had not given us more
                    time. We thought at the time, maybe unrealistically in retrospect, that we had
                    something going in terms of this international flotilla and our diplomacy. Once
                    Israel attacked we were intensely worried about the conflict itself, about the
                    potential for confrontation with the Soviet Union, and we were relieved when it
                    became apparent in the third and fourth day of the conflict that the Israelis
                    were scoring victories all over the place. We realized we were off the hook in
                    terms of prolonged conflict and its impact on American relations elsewhere in
                    the Middle East. There were many people who thought we might have to send troops
                    and certainly would have to send massive supplies of military equipment at the
                    time. But it happened so fast, you could hardly keep the shaded areas on the map
                    moving as fast as the Israelis were taking over these areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, even at your place, was there a feeling of by this
                        point, I'm speaking of personal feeling, that well, Nasser's got his
                        comeuppance. I say this because I was sitting in Yugoslavia at this time and
                        I felt-Well, he asked for it. I mean this is just a personal view of a
                        foreign service officer and I think this was reflected by people who were
                        watching these events from some distance away, in an essentially hostile
                        country, including I might add, the Yugoslavs. Not the Government, but the
                        Yugoslav people were very impressed by this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, until this time—You asked earlier how I felt about Nasser, and as a
                    young man in those days I dealt mainly with young Arabs, and they were all so
                    imbued with the spirit of Arab nationalism at that period, and he embodied that.
                    And then they would say things like, well, you, know, Nasser makes his mistakes;
                    after all he's a human being but at bottom he's the great leader we need. And I
                    remember feeling that Arab nationalism and the kind of reform Nasser represented
                    might be a positive force, one that did not necessarily have to clash with U.S.
                    interests. I was at odds in this with some of the senior people in my own
                    Embassy who were not Arab specialists and who were justifiably more skeptical.
                    My line of argument got harder and harder to sustain as Nasser took actions more
                    and more inimical to American interests during the sixties. The '67 War was the
                    final disillusionment. And it was a watershed in U.S. policy. If you look back
                    before that time, our policy really was that whoever is victorious in any
                    Arab-Israel conflict should not profit by territorial aggrandizement. In terms
                    of basic principle, we had the same view in '67, but with a very important
                    difference, which was that Israel was entitled to stay in the territories it
                    occupied until the Arabs were prepared to come forward and make peace with it.
                    In other words, Israel was entitled to use its forcible occupation of Arab
                    territory as bargaining chips to achieve its objectives. We were all so
                    disillusioned with Nasser, and so relieved by Israel's victory that I don't
                    remember anybody feeling that this was an unjust policy. I was by this time
                    fully supportive of the view that Nasser had seriously let the United States and
                    the world and his own people down, and that he was going to have to pay the
                    price. Unfortunately the Arabs are still paying the price politically for
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: No. I went to the War College in the 1969-70 period so there was a bit
                    of a hiatus in my coverage. I came back as Director of Egyptian Affairs. I was
                    supposed to go overseas after the War College, but this job came up. This proved
                    again to be interesting timing because I checked in just three months before
                    Nasser died and a completely different chapter in Egypt's political history
                    opened.</p>

                <p>STERNER: Yes. One interesting thing to say just as a prelude. When I was in Egypt
                    I got to know Anwar Sadat, a man who at that time no one took very seriously.
                    His job was Chairman of the National Assembly, Egypt's rubber stamp legislature.
                    I used to go and occasionally attend debates, mainly to polish my Arabic, and
                    when I didn't have much else to do. The diplomatic gallery was not full of
                    people in those days because debates were going on in Arabic, and very few of
                    the diplomats spoke Arabic. Sadat must have noticed me, because one day I was
                    invited to tea at his house. That's how I got to know him. Shortly after that, I
                    was transferred back to Washington. When he was invited on a leadership grant to
                    tour the United States...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: This was 1966, February 1966. I was made his escort officer because I
                    was one of the few people in the Government who knew him. Sadat turned out to be
                    an enthusiastic and genial travelling companion and we had a very good time. It
                    may have been partly that he did not have high-level responsibility and I don't
                    think ever dreamed he was ever going to succeed to the mantle of leadership in
                    Egypt. We spent some time here in Washington, quite a bit in Congress because of
                    his parliamentary role, and he called on President Johnson. We went to Los
                    Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, and then ended up in New York. Except for
                    one untoward incident, which consisted of Mayor John Lindsay canceling a dinner
                    party that he had agreed to host because of pressures from the Jewish community,
                    the visit went very well. Sadat's exposure to the U.S. seemed to have genuine
                    impact and I really think that some of his confidence that things could be
                    different in Egypt and that he could work with the U.S. derived from this visit.
                    When I met with him subsequently in Egypt, he just could not stop talking about
                    his visit to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is interesting because here is an Arab leader,
                        although at a lower level, coming to the United States, being taken around
                        and the Jewish community violently, maybe not violently, certainly strongly,
                        anti Nasser, strongly anti-Egyptian at that time. How does one work within
                        this situation and at the same time make the man aware of the depth of
                        feeling within the United States and to understand the politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well, we tried to do that. I mean the people who designed the visit. I
                    remember, for example, a long discussion on this when we called on Pat Brown,
                    who was then the Governor of California in Sacramento. Brown after all had a
                    large Jewish community in California, and the conversation about this was very
                    forthright. They got along marvelously together. He invited Sadat to attend one
                    of the sessions of the legislature and he invited him to join him when he gave a
                    talk to a group of high school students. It was a vivid example of
                    American-style democracy in action.</p>

                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you explaining this to him? Were you trying to give
                        him or were you trying to coat it over, or be diplomatic, or using this as a
                        lesson time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I thought on the whole that the best thing to do was to let this come
                    from people other than his escort officer. Indeed it came from them in one form
                    or another. I remember feeling that I thought I ought to be neutral and
                    facilitating in my role and that I shouldn't seem to be shaping the visit, or
                    being a pedagogue. I think I was right about that because he drew his own
                    conclusions from the experience. He must have met with two dozen Congressmen and
                    Senators during his Washington visit. He had a meeting with Johnson. Of course,
                    other Executive Branch officials. He met with community leaders in California
                    and New York. So he got the full flavor of American life. I think the big
                    impression he went back with— here's a man who had never been to the United
                    States before; he'd been to Europe and to Moscow and to Third World
                    countries—was an impression of dynamism in the United States. It's not that he
                    ended up liking our policy more but I think he respected our society more,
                    particularly in contrast to what he had seen in the Soviet Union and in Third
                    World countries. Something here, strange as this government was over here,
                    something had released the energies of the American people in a creative and
                    productive way. What was the key to that? Because it was what, as he looked back
                    on two decades of rule by Nasser, he felt his own country desperately needed. In
                    that sense, rather than in any specific policy sense, I think he went back
                    feeling that he wanted something of what the United States had. He associated
                    openness, more open political systems, economic free enterprise and less state
                    control over economy as part of the American success story. Even if the seeds of
                    these ideas had already previously been planted in Sadat, and they probably
                    were, I think the American visit gave them a considerable boost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the accession of Sadat? You were Country
                        Director at that time. Not only you but the people who were dealing with
                        this. I mean, a towering figure had left—one who had already been tottering
                        but Sadat, but this time we were more committed to Israel—how did we feel
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: It was hard to get anybody to take Sadat seriously for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was considered an interim figure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>STERNER: He was considered an interim figure and a weak one. He was a question
                    mark for a long time. For nearly a year, until Sadat would against them, it was
                    assumed that Nasser's lieutenants who were still there would control him and
                    might indeed even choose to dump him a little bit later and install one of their
                    own as the real leader of Egypt. Therefore we could expect no major policy
                    changes and had to be prepared for an Egypt that continued to be an adversary.
                    That was very much the mindset in the American Government. It was the mindset in
                    the State Department coming out of the 1967 War and the war of attrition period,
                    and it was also the view of Henry Kissinger, who had come in as Nixon's National
                    Security Advisor. And certainly it was a mindset in Congress. I didn't know how
                    strong Sadat would be and certainly didn't go around saying, “Listen, this is
                    the man of the future” but I did send up memoranda to the Secretary of State
                    saying, keep an open mind about this guy; I've spent some time with him and I
                    think he thinks differently from Gamal Abdul Nasser. That's not to say that he's
                    going to survive because I didn't know that, but if he did he might be a guy we
                    could do business with. At the same time over the winter 1970 to 1971, Don
                    Bergus, who was head of our Interests Section Cairo, was beginning to get
                    some...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might point out at this time that we did not have full
                        diplomatic relations. It was broken off in '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>STERNER: That's right, It was broken off in 1967 as a result of the conflict and
                    ever since that time we had an Interests Section in Cairo which at this time was
                    headed by an experienced careerist by the name of Don Bergus. Bergus was being
                    called up by Sadat and invited to come and talk to him and was beginning to get
                    both directly from Sadat and through various intermediaries a different flavor
                    from the Nasser line. There was a former army fellow who, I can't remember his
                    name now, who was coming directly from Sadat and putting forward these ideas.
                    And as I said, Sadat himself very cautiously in direct meeting with Bergus began
                    to outline some of these ideas. In April of 1970, still fairly new to the Desk,
                    I made just a routine visit out to my area of responsibility. I didn't even
                    expect to be granted an interview with Sadat because after all I was a Country
                    Director and he was the President of a major country, and I expected my contacts
                    to be limited to people in the Foreign Ministry. While I was there an invitation
                    came from Sadat to meet with him. Bergus and I went out and met with him at one
                    of his rest houses at the Barrages, the Dam across the Nile north of Cairo at
                    the head of the Delta. It was a lovely spring day. Sadat had a large
                    topographical relief map of the Sinai tacked up on a board and without many
                    preliminaries—he was happy to see me and so forth—he began to outline a deal for
                    partial Israeli withdrawal in Sinai and a reopening of the Suez Canal. Bergus
                    had some of these ideas before, but not as clearly or in as much detail. We had
                    certainly never heard anything like this from Nasser. Still, there was the
                    question of how stable Sadat was. This was clarified about a month later when
                    there was an attempted coup by Nasserists like Sami Sharaf and Minister of
                    Interior Guma. Sadat moved against them before they could move against him and
                    chucked them out. And that was the end of Nasserist influence in the Sadat
                    regime. At the same time Washington was troubled when Sadat shortly afterward
                    concluded a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. So I was sent out again
                    in July of that year with a set of questions to pose to Sadat to get
                    reassurances. He gave us very good reassurances about this, that this did not
                    indicate that the Soviets would have any more influence, that this did not
                    detract in any way from the ideas he had previously discussed with us, etc. With
                    this in hand we thought we were on the road to a major new opportunity in the
                    Arab-Israel issue. Assistant Secretary Sisco's trip in August of that year was
                    an effort to make further progress. But unfortunately we were up against some
                    serious obstacles. One was Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir who was a very
                    tough and suspicious old lady about these developments in Egypt. She really did
                    not believe there had been any significant change in Cairo. The Israelis were
                    skeptical that he meant what he said, that even if he did, that he had the
                    ability to follow through on it, etc. Essentially the Israelis contributed
                    nothing to this diplomatic dialogue and we were constantly going back to Cairo
                    and saying Now what more can you do for us to help persuade the Israelis you're
                    for real, and Sadat was getting increasingly impatient with this performance.
                    There was just no reciprocity messages coming from the Israelis. The second
                    obstacle was the fact that Sadat himself was not very methodical. He was good at
                    these big concepts, but down the line he didn't have good foreign ministers or
                    advisers who could translate these ideas into smart negotiating tactics. This is
                    a lack that plagued him, throughout his career. Even in the Camp David period
                    later on, we were bedeviled by the same lack of capability. And the third
                    problem was an emerging split over all this between the White House and the
                    State Department. The State Department really thought we had something promising
                    here. Kissinger at the White House was much more skeptical, much more of the
                    Israeli view. He tended to see things in terms of the U.S.-Soviet chessboard on
                    which Israel was our pawn and Egypt was the Soviet Union's pawn. It was just a
                    different optic from the one that we regional specialists tended to have. In
                    this particular case, I think, Kissinger was wrong and we were right. The events
                    of history demonstrated it. Had Israel responded in 1970 and 1971 they could
                    have been spared the 1973 conflict.</p>

                        interviews I have gotten people who have dealt with Henry Kissinger on
                        various things— that often, because he had his own policy on the
                        Soviet-United States chessboard conflict, that he was undercutting other
                        policies by going around and maybe telling the Israelis to hang on tight, as
                        long as you're with us , we're with you. I've gotten this, not in the
                        Arab-Israeli, but in other contexts. Did you have any feeling of this? I
                        don't want to put words in you mouth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Yes. I have mixed feelings about the Kissinger legacy. In some ways, he
                    brought to American foreign policy a needed corrective. We were coming out of a
                    period of excessive bilateralism all over the world, with desk officers rushing
                    up to the Secretary of State and saying, “I'm the Desk Officer for Tierra del
                    Fuego and you've got to realize, Mr. Secretary, that Tierra del Fuego is one of
                    the most strategic places in the world and therefore we have to have this
                    enormous bilateral aid program”. I think Kissinger is to be respected for having
                    brought a more systematic evaluation of American interests-where they were
                    vital, less vital, important, semi-important, some kind of scale of values to an
                    assessment of American interests around the world. He lent a sense of
                    architecture to American foreign policy, as well as accomplishing some very
                    important things like the China opening and getting us out of Vietnam and some
                    major arms control agreements as well. So leaving aside Middle Eastern
                    parochialism for a minute, his contribution was a major one to American foreign
                    policy. Unfortunately, in the Middle East in the 1970-1973 period, his influence
                    was deleterious in my view, and unfortunate. He was undermining an effective
                    policy to avoid yet another Arab-Israeli conflict and to start a negotiating
                    process. He consistently underestimated the importance of regional actors and
                    overestimated the importance of the superpower rivalry and superpower control
                    over events in that part of the world. After all, as we all know, Sadat went to
                    war on his own in '73. The Soviets had very little to say or do about it, and
                    there was plenty of evidence that they were taken almost by as much surprise as
                    the United States was.</p>

                <p>STERNER: Yes, and the Deputy, and the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. I
                    mean those are the people who dealt basically with Kissinger. But relations were
                    already very strained between Rogers and Kissinger at this time, and the strain
                    had a lot to do with the Middle East in specific terms. At my level, I was
                    constantly getting directives, think pieces, national security decision
                    memoranda, that struck me as being wrong. My first action would be to try to get
                    Joe Sisco's attention. He didn't always see it the way I did, but sometimes did,
                    and try to get him to do something about this latest policy distortion. You
                    would see it in many different forms. For example, in the period right after
                    Nasser's death, we had a major problem with Egypt over the commitment it had
                    entered into in the so-called cease-fire-stand still agreement that brought the
                    war of attrition to an end in 1970. The Egyptians had agreed that they would

                <p>STERNER: Not disassemble but cease construction. That was the so-called stand
                    still part of the agreement and to monitor that we had frequent flights of a U-2
                    airplane to conduct aerial photographs which had been agreed to between the two
                    sides as part of the monitoring arrangements, producing very good photography of
                    what was and was not being done in this defense zone. Within days it became
                    quite clear that the Egyptians were cheating. There simply were changes, in
                    ramps being built, enclosures being completed, structures being completed, that
                    had not been completed on the day that the treaty went into effect and which was
                    recorded in that initial photography. Don Bergus in Cairo was instructed over
                    and over again to see Nasser. Nasser would simply deny that anything was
                    happening or say that the photography must be in error. That kind of thing. We
                    realized we had a major problem on our hands. The interesting thing however,
                    coming back to Kissinger-State Department differences, was the different
                    perception of who was responsible for this. It didn't affect our instructions,
                    because we and the White House were both agreeing on instructions saying, “Go to
                    the Egyptians and get them to stop doing this thing”, but from the White House
                    we were constantly getting assessments to the effect that “It's Moscow and the
                    Soviets that are really putting the Egyptians up to this and we ought to be
                    making this a major issue between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                    Kissinger believed Nasser was crippled by the 1967 war and had no personal power
                    any longer. The Soviets are propping him up and of course he's taking orders
                    from the Soviets. It was not however, my perception, having lived in Egypt for
                    five years, but not knowing much about the global perspectives. So, who was
                    right? I can tell you what my speculation is.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: On this cheating business. On why the missiles were being built. I think
                    Nasser was indeed weakened by the 1967 conflict, but not vis-a-vis Moscow. I
                    think he was weakened in terms of his own military. His own military had been
                    extending these missile sites under Israeli bombardment into this zone to
                    protect Egyptian territory from Israeli air attack. All of a sudden, unbeknownst
                    and unconsulted, I suspect the Egyptian generals, air defense generals, are
                    taken by Nasser's agreement with the Israelis and the United States that freezes
                    their activity at a stage that leaves them in a vulnerable position militarily.
                    Should the cease-fire break down as they thought it certainly would at some
                    time, they would be caught with their pants down. They wanted to get these sites
                    done. I think they put it to Nasser in those terms. Nasser probably thought I
                    better not fight them on this one. The Americans are just going to have to
                    accept this, and eventually the activity will come to a stop. No one can prove
                    this, but that's what I think happened. The episode in itself is not all that
                    important, but I cite it as an example of the kind of disagreement that was
                    going on between the State Department and the White House exacerbated by the
                    personal differences between the Secretary of State and the National Security
                    Advisor, and the fact that the President was clearly relying more and more on
                    his National Security Advisor for advice and Rogers was increasingly a Secretary
                    of State who was just meant to continue to manage this bit of machinery called
                    the Department of State and Foreign Service, but have relatively little input on
                    policy matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Mr., Ms. Middle East on the National Security
                        Council whom you would talk to or was Kissinger doing this really from
                        personal conviction? Was there much information going up to him from
                        somebody who knew the Middle East on the National Security Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, I think there was good information. Hal Saunders was over there at
                    that time. He is a very sound man, and probably would not have shared many of
                    those views. You see, Kissinger started out in 1969 saying to everybody the one
                    area I don't want to have anything to do with is the Middle East. The reason is
                    I'm Jewish and even if I were completely impartial which I'm sure I'm not, I
                    would be suspected of not being. So I'm going to leave this area to the State
                    Department. For a while that seemed to be the case, but slowly but surely, as
                    this cease-fire and stand-still agreement took place, as there was a change of
                    leadership in Egypt, as the State Department began to get engaged in this
                    diplomatic effort and to see new opportunities, Kissinger began to feed the
                    President memoranda which took a contrary point of view. I don't think that the
                    people on the National Security staff had much to say about those things because
                    it was not systematic. And their brief in a way was to stay out of the Middle
                    East. But privately some of these memoranda were going forward in effect saying,
                    “Look Mr. President, don't get sucked in entirely by the State Department's
                    views on this matter. Israel is our ally. As long as Israel is strong, the Arabs
                    do not have the ability to make a new war in this part of the world and we
                    should be very very reluctant to discard that policy which has served us quite
                    well over the years for something new and uncertain when we don't know how
                    stable this guy Sadat is, when it's going to cause a ruckus down in Congress,
                    when the Russians will see it as weakness, and so forth. This began to lessen
                    the President's confidence in what the State Department was doing. At about the
                    same time we were running into great problems in trying to move the thing
                    forward, because Golda Meir was having none of it, and Anwar Sadat was so
                    unsystematic that he couldn't take advantage of the situation. We were not going
                    anywhere and Kissinger on the other hand was gaining the President's increasing
                    respect because of his ideas about China, about how to get out of Vietnam, and
                    so forth, and suddenly we turned around and Kissinger was not only calling the
                    shots everywhere else, but calling the shots on this one as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now I wonder if you'd talk about another player there,
                        although in a subsidiary role. And that was Joseph Sisco who became a very
                        close collaborator with Kissinger at a later date. But this time you're
                        talking about him being, what was he like working for him? After all he's a
                        controversial person. This is somewhat different role from what you see
                        later. Could you talk about him and working with him and how he
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Yes. As assistant secretaries in NEA go, Sisco was a particularly strong
                    bureaucrat, and I don't mean that in any invidious sense, I mean it as a
                    compliment. He could get things done more effectively than most other assistant
                    secretaries that I've seen and most people with foreign service background. He
                    was very good at seizing the initiative and at retaining control over affairs.
                    Indeed, we saw this happen in a very vivid way. He moved from Assistant
                    Secretary in IO to NEA ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IO for International Organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>STERNER: International Organization Affairs. And when he was there he had control
                    over several issues that might have been construed as Middle Eastern issues.
                    Such things as the refugee problems, Middle Eastern issues that were handled by
                    the United Nations. Joe wanted to run those and he did while he was Assistant
                    Secretary. The minute he came over to NEA he brought with him all those issues,
                    so we realized what a powerful Assistant Secretary could do for you. I found him
                    effective in this way. He also lent a new cast to our whole operation as a
                    bureau. Let me speak about that for a moment. Traditionally many of our
                    Assistant Secretaries of State had come up through the ranks as Middle Eastern
                    specialists in one form or another. There had been a few exceptions to this.
                    Phillips Talbot, for example, who was John Kennedy's appointment was an outsider
                    who came in. But the others, Parker Hart, Ray Hare, for example, were area
                    experts. And it meant this was a place where you could at least expect a
                    dispassionate view of American foreign policy interests in the Middle East to
                    prevail. In many other quarters of the U.S. Government you had to expect that
                    the judgment would be affected one way or another by domestic political
                    considerations, or at least that they would not put up a big battle to resist
                    domestic political pressures. And in general, we expected, whether our Assistant
                    Secretaries were Arabists, as they occasionally were, or if they were people
                    brought in, we expected that kind of view to prevail at the Assistant Secretary
                    level. Joe Sisco brought something different. He did not perceive his job as
                    being one to speak up for Arabs, or our interests in the Arab world. And in that
                    respect, I think he was a disappointment to many of the Arabist officers or the
                    Middle East specialists in the Bureau. He was much more interested in getting
                    something accomplished and believed that the way you did that, rather than just
                    standing up for a policy interest point of view, was to understand and work
                    within domestic policy constraints to get something done. It was only through
                    that type of attitude and that viewpoint that you could effectively relate to
                    the seventh floor, the Secretary of State, and the political levels of our
                    Government. Sisco was success-oriented. What good, he would have asked himself,
                    does it do to stand on principle if you can't accomplish anything? And he saw
                    accomplishing something as the only way to approach the big objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, we're talking about domestic
                        politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: We're talking about domestic politics. But also about the global as
                    opposed to regional viewpoint. Joe usually saw which way the wind was blowing.
                    In order to get a few points won and a few things done for the State Department
                    he knew he was going to have to take into account and maybe meet half way the
                    Kissinger point of view. He was really fundamentally different in attitude. Now
                    was it more effective or less effective? There were times when I felt it was far
                    more effective, and operational, than what had gone before. At other times I
                    thought Joe was being too tactical and sacrificing too much of what should have
                    been policy firmness for the sake of achieving short-lived tactical
                    advances.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give some examples now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: No, it's really...I would have to review notes to do that, to be fair to
                    Sisco. I can just at this stage, give you my impression that I reacted, maybe on
                    several occasions, saying Joe, you're giving too much for tactical reasons here
                    and you're eroding an important point of policy that ought to remain firm. And
                    that of course had to do mainly with giving in to the Israelis at various times,
                    with what they wanted. You know, give them those aircraft, don't fight them on
                    there settlements, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the October '73 War play out from your
                        perspective? How did we react to it and what were you doing at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well, again, I happened to be back—I mean, I was still back. It was six
                    years later, or whatever, from the '67 war and I was still in the Department.
                    This time I was a couple of notches up the line. But there I was setting up
                    another Task Force. This was a much more interesting, difficult and of course
                    less decisive war. To Kissinger's credit he saw about midway through the
                    conflict that there were major diplomatic opportunities that could be seized, if
                    you could bring this conflict to an end in a way that preserved those diplomatic
                    opportunities. And he charged in. He had just moved over from the National
                    Security position to the State Department as Secretary, so he was in a position
                    to do that. He had all those loyal folks over at the White House still working
                    for him in effect. Brent Scowcroft had been there as his Deputy, and saw
                    eye-to-eye with him on most issues. And now he had all this machinery he could
                    mobilize as he saw fit within the State Department. He negotiated the terms for
                    a cease-fire with the Soviets that set the stage for negotiations. He fought the
                    Israelis down when they wanted to persist in the war so as to complete the
                    encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army in the Sinai. He knew if that whole army
                    was captured or destroyed the Egyptians would be so humiliated and so defeated
                    that it would detract from post-war diplomatic opportunities. And in this case
                    the Israelis backed down. In essence, the war ended on a no-victor, no-loser
                    note which was important for what transpired. Kissinger got talks going at
                    Kilometer 101 in Sinai, which led to a more stable cease-fire. Then talks began
                    under U.S.-Soviet auspices in Geneva. The Soviets were then firmly moved out of
                    the picture and Kissinger took over the negotiations himself. He achieved three
                    agreements: the first Sinai agreement, the agreement for disengagement on the
                    Syrian front, and finally the Sinai II agreement for a further stage of
                    withdrawal. So it was a notable achievement. But with the Sinai II agreement the
                    potential for further progress along these lines was exhausted. You could not
                    carry this slice-of-territory for slice-of-peace concept any further. The Sinai
                    II agreement was a victory but it had its costs for American policy in the form
                    of an ill-considered undertaking never to deal with the PLO which plagued our
                    policy for the next ten years. Kissinger agreed to that. The Israelis got very
                    tough—said they were not going to agree to the Sinai agreement without this
                    assurance and he ended up giving them that. And then I went off to the United
                    Arab Emirates at about this point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Kissinger at this time use the Desk? Or the
                        Country Directorate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: It was frustrating. Kissinger really was his own show. It was
                    frustrating for me but if you talked to Joe Sisco who had by this time become
                    Political Under Secretary, and he reminisces accurately about this period, he
                    would admit to at least equal frustration. Kissinger was an exciting guy to work
                    for. I mean he was the man who was getting these agreements done, he knew how to
                    use power, he was a supreme diplomat, he had these Middle Eastern leaders eating
                    out of his hand. At the same time he was maddening because he wouldn't confide
                    in you completely and wouldn't delegate authority on any systematic basis, which
                    maybe a Country Director couldn't expect, but the Under Secretary had a right to
                    expect every now and then. He dealt behind your back with other intermediaries.
                    The end result was that you got used as a flunky of one kind or another. And if
                    you got upset about it, he sent you off as an Ambassador somewhere. He didn't
                    hold it against you, he just didn't find it very convenient to continue to
                    operate with you around. In fact, he may have thought these are the people we
                    ought to have as Ambassadors. He was frustrating. But there was a lot to do at
                    the desk level. We were emerging from a situation of severed relations with
                    Egypt. I had a very busy desk all of a sudden which meant without even messing
                    with high policy up there on the Arab-Israeli problem, I had a lot to do. We had
                    to reconstruct our entire embassy staff, get an aid mission out there to take
                    care of aid matters, and deal with debt problems. I helped negotiate a
                    debt-relief program and also spent a lot of time organizing the effort to clear
                    and reopen the Suez Canal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: You mean going to the United Arab Emirates? Right. Well, it was really
                    my second to last assignment because I came back as Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    later.</p>

                    office at about 1:30, and I think I'm just going to grab a bite. I don't want to
                    run out of time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Going from the policy maelstrom of the Arab-Israeli problem out to one
                    of the most remote parts of the world took quite a bit of psychological
                    adjustment. Mind you, I remembered this part of the Arab world having started
                    there many years before. But that was twenty years earlier. And I really wanted
                    to go back. I had a good time when I worked for ARAMCO and I liked those Bedouin
                    types. I was the first resident Ambassador in the UAE and the country had
                    achieved its independence only a few years before, after more than a century, as
                    a British protectorate. There was much to do. There was first of all a lot of
                    question as to whether this rather shaky federation between the emirates...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there seven or five of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Seven of them, a couple of them so tiny one could hardly spot them on
                    the map. The Sheiks were nevertheless rulers who were dealt with as rulers of
                    territory by the British. Maybe sovereign is too strong a word for that in legal
                    terms. In any case, when the British made the decision to withdraw east of Suez
                    in 1969 they had to work very fast to put these people together. They knew they
                    couldn't survive as individual entities and they finally stitched something
                    together in which the seven agreed to form a kind of confederation with a
                    federal government responsible for banking and currency and foreign policy. So
                    you had an unusual situation which was like dealing with the American States
                    under the Articles of Confederacy. The individual Emirates had a great deal of
                    authority, particularly over economic matters. If for example you were
                    interested in an oil concession in Dubai, you didn't waste time by going to
                    anybody in Abu Dhabi which was the Federal Capital, you went directly to speak
                    to the ruler of Dubai, and he had an exclusive say as to who would get that oil
                    concession. He maintained his own armed forces. So one question was whether the
                    Federation would hold together and who was on top; who would emerge as the
                    effective leaders. And that gave you scope for a certain amount of political
                    reporting. Another major commission was commercial work. The area had been, as
                    you remember Stuart, from your own early days travelling there, totally
                    dominated by British companies. That was part of the deal. The Sheikdoms got
                    British protection, but in return they didn't deal with foreign companies. The
                    oil companies were the Iraq Petroleum Company, a British-run consortium that had
                    the oil concessions down there, and all the big engineering and infrastructure
                    projects were carried out by British companies. I saw it as one of my tasks to
                    try to get some American commercial activity going down there. There was a
                    desire to diversify on the part of the rulers but it was a difficult process.
                    They were very used to, for example, British consultants and British engineers,
                    which drew plans that favored British construction companies. So a major part of
                    our battle was to say, Listen, give us an even playing field here commercially.
                    Gradually they did. Fortunately, I had a very effective economic and commercial
                    officer...</p>

                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Dennis Finnerty. He did a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let me ask, because I speak as someone who was a
                        very lowly Vice Consul was the commercial officer for the Persian Gulf back
                        in '58-'60. We couldn't get American firms to give the time of day to make
                        bids and to look at this. Now I assume this had changed? Had you found
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Oh, it has changed completely now. But at the time I was there it was in
                    the process of being changed and relatively early in the change. So the
                    situation you knew was much the reality that we were fighting against. As you
                    say, the British just had it locked up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also the American firms weren't giving much time or
                        trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well, they weren't for good reason, because they knew if they were
                    invited down there at all it was generally as a stalking horse to enable some
                    British firm to prove that it was really the lowest bidder. They thought, and
                    with good reason, that the contracts down there were cooked in favor of British
                    companies. Gradually it changed though. Nowadays I think American companies have
                    a good crack, at least in some areas. Of course, in some areas we are simply not
                    competitive. Like road building and bridge building and that sort of thing. The
                    Koreans can do these things so well and so much more cheaply, but now even the
                    Koreans are being undercut by Turks, Paks and Yugoslavs. The third area which
                    was so interesting at the time was oil affairs. Abu Dhabi and the United Arab
                    Emirates as a whole was the sixth largest oil exporter of the world at the time.
                    And one of the countries that have major reserves, unlike Libya, for example,
                    whose reserves are not expected to last very long. So there was a good deal of
                    interest on the part of Washington in oil policy , in OPEC, in the United Arab
                    Emirates role within OPEC at the time, in concession affairs, who was getting
                    the concessions. We had a small staff, but a pretty busy staff working all these
                    fronts. When you got tired of the people in Abu Dhabi, you could travel to one
                    of the other Emirates and get a completely different set of characters with a
                    different set of problems that you could deal with. Of course some of these
                    places were the smaller and poorest Emirates that had no oil. You couldn't spend
                    much time there and justify it.</p>

                <p>STERNER: It was not on the top of the list. That's right. The main work was in
                    Dubai and of course Abu Dhabi, which were the two biggest oil producers. The
                    rulers in my day didn't speak much English so I was forced to bring my Arabic up
                    to speed which I benefited from and enjoyed. I thought I was going to spend a
                    third year down there but I was summoned back to the Department again to work on
                    more Arab-Israel stuff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time was Carter in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I actually got back at the very tail end of the Nixon Administration.
                    But Carter came in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Ford.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I mean Ford. Exactly. The job I was brought back for did not as it
                    happened open up. It was to be the Middle East man on the NSC staff, but that
                    didn't pan out. Then one of the Deputy jobs in NEA opened up. It was back to my
                    old Arab-Israeli specialty, but the timing was very fortunate. I took the job
                    only a few months before Sadat made his famous trip to Jerusalem, and what had
                    been in doldrums the whole time I was in Abu Dhabi, suddenly became the
                    liveliest thing in town. Originally the job was to cover geographic
                    responsibilities, several desks that had Egypt, Israel, the Levant, as well as
                    Arab-Israeli negotiations. But the Arab-Israel negotiations side of it proved to
                    be so time consuming that they split the job off, and I took over that
                    responsibility. I went along on all of Vance's shuttles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Cyrus Vance.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>STERNER: Yes, the Secretary of State. Under Hal Saunder's direction, who was the
                    Assistant Secretary, I was responsible for preparing all of the staffing for the
                    trips and the paperwork that had to be done. I was expected to come up with
                    ideas on how to move this thing forward. Later, when it was decided to use a
                    special emissary, first Roy Atherton, then Bob Strauss, and Sol Linowitz, I had
                    a sort of double role. I was a Deputy to them and made trips with them while
                    still holding the Bureau responsibility. I did an awful lot of travelling in
                    those days.Working both for the Secretary of State and for the special
                    emissaries was interesting and sometimes a bit difficult because there were
                    frequent differences of view about how to proceed. It ended as we know with
                    Jimmy Carter summoning everyone to Camp David in September of 1978. I then had
                    the professionally rewarding experience of being on the American delegation
                    which supported the peace treaty negotiations at Blair House and at the Madison
                    Hotel, that finally resulted in the Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt. We
                    thought the Egypt-Israel negotiations would give us a good start on doing
                    something about the Palestinian issue, but unfortunately we were wrong. Before
                    the day was over, I must have spent thousands of man-hours trying to get the
                    so-called autonomy talks for the West Bank and Gaza off the ground. Bob Strauss
                    and Sol Linowitz were our leaders in that effort. We ran into the insurmountable
                    problem, which was the Israelis wanted their bilateral peace treaty with Egypt,
                    but did not want anything to happen on the West Bank or Gaza. They just stalled,
                    and Washington was not prepared to have a major crisis in U.S.-Israeli relatives
                    to break the impasse. So, the autonomy talks gradually ran into the sand. In my
                    final year in the Department, before I decided to retire, I had another
                    assignment coming out of the Peace Treaty, which was to set up the peace-keeping
                    force that is a buffer between the two sides in Sinai, between Israel and Egypt
                    in Sinai. The UN Security Council, not favoring what increasingly became
                    apparent as a bilateral peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, would not
                    participate, would not agree that this force should be constituted under a
                    United Nations mandate. So the three parties, Egypt, Israel with the United
                    States help, determined to set up their own peacekeeping force, outside of the
                    UN and I headed the negotiating team that helped the two sides fashion an
                    agreement. I had a good time doing this and it was nice to leave the
                    Department—instead of on a note of disappointment which would have been the case
                    with the autonomy talks, to leave on an upper, at the conclusion of a successful
                    negotiation and a professionally rewarding experience. I don't know how much
                    time you want to go spend on this, Stu.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go into it. But first I'd like to go back one
                        and then come back to this. When you came back and you were dealing with the
                        Arab-Israeli problem once again, what was your impression of the Israeli
                        Government, particularly Menachem Begin and his Government? How did we view
                        it and how did we deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>STERNER: Anyone who knew anything about the background of the Arab-Israel problem
                    had deep cause to be worried about the implications of Begin's coming to power
                    because in 1970, if I remember correctly, Begin led his party out of the then
                    National Coalition Government on the issue of whether Security Council
                    Resolution 242 calling for Israeli withdrawal from territories in exchange for
                    peace applied to the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza. His
                    position was that the Security Council Resolution was all well and good for the
                    Syrian front and the Egyptian front but it didn't have anything to do with the
                    old mandated territories of Palestine. On this he parted company with Prime
                    Minister Golda Meir, whose government had agreed to the proposition that
                    Security Council Resolution 242 applied to all occupied territories. Now when he
                    reappeared as Prime Minister, head of the largest coalition in the Knesset, six
                    or seven years later, people who remembered his personality which was
                    single-minded and stubborn, could have made the reasonable assumption that he
                    was not going to change his views on that subject. On the other hand, Begin was
                    a bold leader. He'd after all created a party out of nothing. Herut was his
                    creation. And built it to a point that it had become the main challenge to the
                    Labor Party. I think there was something of that in his background, a
                    willingness to take chances; which made it possible to get the peace treaty with
                    Egypt. Unfortunately the present leader of Israel, Yitzhak Shamir, with whom
                    we're wrestling now, voted against the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, even though he
                    was a member of Begin's party. And I think one of the problems we're finding
                    with Shamir is that he has all of Begin's stubbornness and none of his
                    imagination and none of his boldness. Maybe imagination is too strong a term but
                    at least none of his boldness. So, we were mainly frustrated, and God knows so
                    was Anwar Sadat, but at least the leadership in Israel in those days was
                    strong.</p>

                <p>STERNER: And could deliver. Today you have a Government that's not strong and no
                    one knows what it could deliver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression? I mean, as time goes on, Jimmy
                        Carter seems to grow in my estimation; he's been involved in the tricky
                        business in Nicaragua and he's comported himself extremely well. This is my
                        own—but what is your impression of how he operated and how much he was in
                        control of this process, as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>STERNER: He was, the most effective President that we've had on Middle Eastern
                    Affairs, because at some point he got interested personally in the Arab-Israel
                    problem. And I think he genuinely felt, without any anti-Israeli feelings, that
                    some kind of redress should be done for the Palestinians, that they had lost
                    their homeland. He also felt a keen personal bond with Anwar Sadat, that Sadat
                    was a great statesman of the period. Carter just got involved in a way which was
                    unprecedented for an American President. A great deal of credit must be given to
                    him for his boldness in summoning everyone to Camp David. A lot of these things
                    are pre-cooked and you have these Presidential meetings, summit meetings, you
                    know exactly what's going to happen ahead of time. Quite clearly this was not
                    the case at Camp David. It was a high-risk proposition. He could have looked
                    very poorly if it had turned out badly, and it damned near did, if Sadat hadn't
                    gone the extra mile and saved his bacon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well, Sadat gave in, perhaps not wisely, on a number of key issues.
                    Jerusalem was one of them, the question of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
                    being another, the whole question of linkage between the bilateral peace
                    settlement between Egypt and Israel, and the Palestinian question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is whole other thing and I hope sometime we can
                        work something to go into this, maybe with Dick Parker. I wonder if you
                        could tell some of the problems you had with setting up this peacekeeping
                        operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: The first problem was to get the Israelis and Egyptians to agree on the
                    terms under which the force would be set up. I had no idea how complicated this
                    would be—establishing a peacekeeping operation de novo, outside of the UN. I got
                    good advice from Brian Urquhart, the UN Assistant Secretary General who had set
                    up so many peace keeping forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he British or Irish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: No, he's British, and a fine man. Incidentally, if you haven't read his
                    memoirs they're quite interesting. He also did a good biography of Hammarskjold.
                    He writes well. He had fascinating experiences in the Congo as well as the
                    Middle East. Anyway, to get back to the Sinai force, there was the question of
                    the size and composition of the force: the Egyptians wanted it as small as
                    possible, and the Israelis had no confidence in it unless it was considerably
                    larger than that. How should it be equipped? The Egyptians wanted very lightly
                    armed forces, the Israelis wanted heavy military equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? I mean why would there be this difference between
                        size and equipment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: The Israelis basically saw it as a force that might well have to fight.
                    The Egyptians saw such a large force as a derogation of their sovereignty
                    because of course the force was entirely stationed in the Sinai, on their
                    territory. And as they saw it the peacekeeping force had been imposed on them as
                    a condition of the peace treaty. It was not something they liked. There were
                    also problems about where these units should be stationed, about where the
                    observation posts should be placed. The Israelis made a determined effort to try
                    to get the Egyptians to agree that two large Air Force bases in Sinai that the
                    Israelis had built should be used exclusively by the force. The Egyptians didn't
                    want that because they saw that as a further detraction of their sovereign right
                    to reoccupy Sinai as they saw fit. At the beginning the two sides disagreed
                    about every provision and detail. There was the additional problem of creating
                    the zones, of how you staffed the observer mission to carry out the peace
                    treaty's provisions for the other zones in the Sinai. We also had a major
                    problem about American involvement. The Israelis wanted American troops in the
                    force. The new Reagan administration also liked the idea. You know, we must
                    reverse the Vietnam syndrome. Let's show them that we can send American boys out
                    there. But the Egyptians didn't want American forces there. They wanted
                    contingents from non-aligned countries. We had difficulties over such matters as
                    a status of forces agreement. What happens when one of these soldiers was
                    arrested for drunkenness in Cairo or Jerusalem. So it was a prolonged
                    negotiation, but I had the enormous advantage that both sides knew that unless
                    they came to an agreement the Peace Treaty would not be implemented. I had a
                    little delegation that consisted of a political officer, a military adviser—a
                    Colonel in the American Army—a legal adviser from the State Department, a couple
                    of other specialists brought in from time to time to help me out. And we had
                    excellent support from the Embassies and the Consulate General in Jerusalem. We
                    negotiated to have one session in Jerusalem, next session in Cairo and got to
                    know those places pretty well. I must have made nine or ten trips to both
                    places, occasionally shuttling between the two with the help of the Cairo Air
                    Attach�'s little Beechcraft aircraft. It was a professional challenge and also a
                    lot of fun. As your career goes along in the State Department, no matter what
                    position you reach, there's always somebody looking over your shoulder, so to
                    have almost exclusive responsibility with nobody between you and the Secretary
                    of State to just get something done, was very gratifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this really the order—Get something! I mean, rather
                        than we want it like this, I mean it was really let's get this thing
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>STERNER: No one cared what the details were, but they wanted this thing to be in
                    place by the time the peace treaty was supposed to go into effect. So I had a
                    deadline of about eight months to get it done. And we had a lot to do in this
                    period. For example, funding turned out to be a major problem. Both the
                    Egyptians and the Israelis started out saying we're not going to contribute a
                    penny to this. I had to go back and say to them, Uncle Sam sure as hell isn't
                    going to pay for the whole thing and you know, we had some tough sessions on
                    this point. I finally got Sadat to agree to put up a third of the money and the
                    Israelis — I said, if he puts a third, you've got to put up a third—and got them
                    to agree to that. I committed the USG to the other third, and to a financial
                    arrangement for the initial year, because there were some major start up costs,
                    for the U.S. to pay 60% of the costs, the Egyptians and Israelis 40%. We made a
                    hand-shake deal on this without even reporting it to the Department, let alone
                    Congress. I knew I had to get something done, and that time was limited. I said
                    this may be the end of my career but to hell with it. I then came home to face
                    the music in Congress. I went down there and said this is the arrangement which
                    I think will be real good if we can get it, if we can only sell it and Lee
                    Hamilton and others down there said, Gee, it sounds all right to me. Compared to
                    what Federal officials generally have to go through to get funding for projects,
                    I still can't believe it happened so easily. People tell me now, who are
                    involved in that part of the world, that the Sinai peace-keeping force works
                    well and that the agreement and all the details we negotiated provide a good
                    foundation for its operations. Much of that was not my doing but the doing of
                    Ray Hunt, who was appointed to be the first Director General of the
                    Multi-national Force and Observers, and was tragically assassinated in Rome
                    where he had his headquarters by Italian Red Brigade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it connected with it, or just...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: I think he was just a convenient target of some kind. You know, next to
                    the Ambassador who may have been better guarded, he was one of the prominent
                    Americans in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the other great power, the Pentagon, which was
                        going to supply the troops, how did you find dealing with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: It was difficult getting countries, including our own country, to
                    participate. At first the Pentagon really didn't want to have anything to do
                    with this thing. They were with the Egyptians. It ought to be a non-aligned
                    operation. But at a very high level the Israelis clamored for American
                    participation. The answer is they didn't have any confidence that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they'd already been through this other thing in
                        '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>STERNER: Exactly. And had a good reason to have some lack of confidence in
                    peacekeeping forces. So the State Department made up its mind that it was in
                    favor of American presence, and we after all had a Secretary of State at that
                    time who had been a military officer, who had considerable clout with the
                    Pentagon. And it was decided that the Pentagon should contribute an infantry
                    battalion and some support elements. The only trouble was these packages came in
                    much larger units than we wanted in the Sinai. For example, we got a Fijian
                    battalion that was 600 man strong. Self supporting American battalions don't
                    come at less than a thousand and we had already negotiated an overall manpower
                    limit for the force which had been very difficult to get because the Egyptians
                    had been so sticky about it, and then we had to go back to them and say, listen,
                    I'm sorry, but if we have to have American forces and we do, we have to raise
                    these limits. It was also very difficult to persuade any other countries to
                    participate. We finally got a battalion from Fiji, that great power out there in
                    the South Pacific somewhere, and Colombia, which was somewhat more respectable
                    or at least a country which people had heard of. And that was the initial force
                    along with the U.S. battalion. Then with that in place, our European and other
                    allies began to say that it was something we can participate in in a quiet way
                    and they contributed some support elements. The Italians gave us a couple of
                    frigates, well not frigates, but small naval vessels that patrolled the Sharm el
                    Sheikh area. The French gave us helicopters. The Australians and New Zealanders
                    gave us fixed wing aircraft. The British gave us an MP contingent. And gradually
                    it became a real international force. Since then the Canadians have come in with
                    something. So it's worked out well. I had several meetings with Anwar Sadat
                    himself, shortly before he was assassinated, and with Menachem Begin, so it was
                    a fascinating experience for me. And before I got involved with anything else, I
                    decided to retire and do other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are you doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STERNER: Well, I'm mainly earning my bread in a consulting company but I've
                    gotten involved in a couple of entrepreneurial things on my own. The consulting
                    company is international oriented with four partners who give it reasonable
                    global scope. I tend to look after Middle Eastern work when we have it. It's
                    mainly helping American corporations doing business overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one last question I'd like to ask. If a young man or
                        woman comes to you and asks, Mr. Ambassador, what about the foreign service
                        as a career? We're talking about today. How do you reply?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>STERNER: I tend to be a booster in spite of all the bad things we know about, and
                    perhaps the things that are weak in the Service since our days, Stuart. There
                    is, I think, lower morale generally within the Service. There are far greater
                    problems because the issue of distaff jobs, of double positions for married
                    couples, all that business. Nevertheless I started out in life as a private
                    sector person and am now back in the private sector and I feel two ways looking
                    back on it. First of all, I am grateful that I had the opportunity to spend the
                    bulk of my professional career in public service. Secondly, there are not many
                    jobs in the private sector that have as much day-to-day interest and fun as most
                    foreign service jobs. Of course that can vary. I may have had a particularly
                    interesting time during my career. Perhaps others have not been so rewarding.
                    Obviously you have cases of people who get diseases which isn't fun at all, but
                    I think on average, the Foreign Service offers more interesting work wherever
                    you are and whatever line you get into than most private sector careers that
                    I've seen. I have really no regrets, and I think furthermore that some kind of
                    low point has probably been reached in the Service. And it's likely to come up
                    as we adjust to many new things: a smaller overall Service; acknowledgment that
                    the United States doesn't have this enormous role in the world—has a more modest
                    role to play, but nevertheless, it seems to me a leadership role; adjusting to a
                    bisexual service; adjusting to affirmative action for minorities, getting rid of
                    the big bulge at the top. But if they can shape up on these things and get some
                    sort of stability it's bound to be once again a good career, and being an
                    American diplomat, although it may involve somewhat less status than it did in
                    the 1950's and 1960's when we were all regarded as Proconsuls of some kind in
                    many parts of the world, is still going to be a lot more challenging and
                    interesting than being a Turkish diplomat or a Danish diplomat. You have real
                    things to do out there, and the United States Government will be playing a lead
                    in developing a world mechanism for the new “global” problems—the environment,
                    world economic imbalances—to mention just a few. So I would say, if you're not
                    worried about living in foreign countries, and you are interested in foreign
                    affairs, I would place a Foreign Service career on the list of things you should
                    be looking at as a young man or woman.</p>
