                <p>CORNELIUS D. SCULLY, III</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: William D. Morgan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 16, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>SUMMARY: Cornelius D. Scully, III, holds the most senior legal position in the
                    Visa Office of the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs. Calling on and
                    his over thirty years of association with the visa function, he details in this
                    interview the major issues facing U.S. migration policy over the period. With
                    both Foreign Service experience, which he entered in 1960, and subsequent
                    domestic service, he probably has had more direct and influential involvement in
                    both the finely detailed as well as far-reaching aspects of immigration matters.
                    As a lawyer he gives advise, interpretations and just plain solid counsel on all
                    aspects of the various visa laws. In this interview he spells out clearly, and
                    in most human terms—at times amusingly, the whys and wherefores of the changes
                    in attitudes and the pressures from interest segments of American society which
                    caused Congress to change the immigration laws over the years. Mr. Scully is
                    most explicit in detailing all the principal issues operating in the immigration
                    laws of 1965, 1986 and 1990, and various amendments when important. He knows the
                    important players both in Congress and in the Department, and talks with zest
                    and personal insights on how they operated, and why. One of the most interesting
                    and insightful are his anecdotes about Abba Schwartz, for whom he was a staff
                    aide when Mr. Scully was a junior officer.</p>
                <p>BIOGRAPHY: Cornelius D. Scully III, born into a politically alert New Deal family
                    who moved to Washington when he was young, seemed destined by temperament and
                    background for the senior ranks of the U.S. government. After graduating from
                    the University of Virginia and serving in the Navy, he entered the Foreign
                    Service in 1960. His first tours were in the consular sections of Nice and
                    Montreal. Returning to a domestic assignment in the Visa Office, then part of
                    the Security and Consular Administration, later to become the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs, Mr. Scully worked in the Regulations and Legislation division. Evenings
                    he pursued his law degree, successfully. Therefore, highly equipped to move on
                    in the legal areas of visa law, Mr. Scully transferred to the Civil Service and
                    progressed upward in rank and responsibility. Today he is Director for
                    Legislation, Regulations, and Advisory Assistance in the office of the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Visa Services.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>This is the first in a series of ten oral history interviews conducted under the
                    Abba Schwartz Foundation Award granted to retired Foreign Service officers
                    Charles Stuart Kennedy and William D. Morgan. The interviews will focus largely
                    on the visa function as part of migration to the United States and how the State
                    Department is involved in adjudicating the laws of Congress as they relate to
                    interviewing aliens abroad to determine their eligibility to enter the U.S..
                    This is the counterpart function performed by the Immigration and Naturalization
                    Service at U.S. ports of entry.</p>
                <p>Cornelius Scully, known to some of us as Dick, has been associated with the visa
                    function for a goodly number of years. Dick and I worked together when I was
                    deputy director of the Visa Office back in the late seventies at a time when we
                    were just beginning to “manage” the visa function with modern technology, and
                    we're still trying to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First of all, Dick, give us something of your background
                        and what brought you into this work, both in the Foreign Service, the [U.S.]
                        Civil Service, and something of your background academically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Bill, my dad's family were all from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, very
                    political people. I grew up in a very, very political household, all very strong
                    New Dealers. As a strong New Dealer, my father had come to Washington at the
                    beginning of the Second World War and worked for the government. So I grew up in
                    Washington and I grew up in this very political environment. I also grew up in
                    an environment where government service was seen to be a good thing, a useful
                    thing, even a noble thing. My father used to say to me that as far as he was
                    concerned, there were only two really useful careers: one of them was teaching
                    and the other was government service.</p>
                <p>I had an uncle. My dad's sister married a very interesting man who was a Foreign
                    Service officer, or half of his career he was with the Foreign Service, the
                    other half he was with the Pan American Union. He eventually became deputy
                    director general of Pan American Union before he finally retired. I really think
                    it was my Uncle Will Sanders who turned me toward the Foreign Service as opposed
                    to some other government agency or government service in a broader sense, not so
                    much by lecturing or trying to overtly proselytize me for the State Department
                    or the Foreign Service, but just by his example and by knowing him, living
                    around him, and associating with him, I think I was turned toward the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we get a time frame here, Dick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: This was basically in the 1940s, 1950s, when I was growing up, going
                    through high school, went off to college in 1953, the University of
                    Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You lived in Virginia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: We lived here in the Washington area over in Alexandria for years while
                    my dad worked for the government. So I grew up in the Washington area. My Uncle
                    Will also lived in Washington when he wasn't overseas, and they were overseas a
                    few times. He was DCM in Santiago, Chile, at one point, and earlier during the
                    Second World War he had been on the Inter-American Defense Committee in
                    Montevideo, but other than that, he was in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your work at the University of Virginia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I was a history major and I was in the ROTC program. I was a rising naval
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the end of World War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, this was from 1953 to 1957 that I was at university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is the Korean period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Post-Korean War, yes. When I was on active duty in the Navy, we weren't
                    shooting at anyone. It was after Korea, but before Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what we might characterize these days as “government
                        wasn't too bad” a period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: It was not seen as bad; it was seen as good, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wish we could turn this interview into that subject, but
                        we can't. Now let's return to how you joined the State Department and the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SCULLY: After I graduated from the University of Virginia, I went on active duty
                    in the Navy because of my NROTC commitment, and I had three years during which
                    my career was laid out for me. Obviously, however, one thinks about what one
                    will do after that, and a point came when I decided to apply to the Foreign
                    Service. So I made my application to take the written examination, and when that
                    came through, I took leave from the Navy a few days, came to Washington, took
                    the exam here, then I was notified that I'd passed it, and I went through the
                    oral. This would have been in late 1959, early 1960. I had my oral interview at
                    the State Department, in the State Department building itself in early 1960, and
                    I was told that I had passed. I still had about six months left of active duty
                    in the Navy, but the processing for the Foreign Service was lengthy—the security
                    clearance, and you had to wait for an appointment and all that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>So I got out of the Navy in the summer of 1960, and I still hadn't heard anything
                    from the State Department; the paperwork was still going through. I got a job
                    teaching public school in Norfolk, Virginia, essentially as a holding pattern
                    until I would hear from the Foreign Service. In late 1961, I was notified that I
                    had been appointed to the Foreign Service and that I should report to the State
                    Department in January 1962 to go into the junior officer training class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was almost a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: It was better than a year. It was about eighteen months, actually,
                    between the time that I had my oral interview and the time that I actually
                    reported. It was about a year after that, that I was notified what the schedule
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you know that thirty years later, the same
                        complaint is still out there. I'm told it has been corrected, but I'll
                        believe it when I see it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I understand it may be even longer than that now, but in any event, that
                    was pretty much the timing. So in January '62, I came up to Washington, and on
                    the day after New Year's, I reported in and went into the A-100 class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A-100 being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The basic junior officer training course, which was then a four-month
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you taught the skills of the trade, including visa
                        adjudication?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Very little about visa adjudication or consular work that I recall. I
                    don't have that clear a memory of the classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't too impressive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, I don't think that any of us were all that impressed. It's not like
                    that classic professor in college that you never forget even fifty years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went off to the real Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Not entirely. During the A-100 class, everyone had to fill out a first
                    bid list, I guess you'd call it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The druthers list.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Your druthers list. Exactly. For personal reasons, I asked for a
                    Washington assignment, and, lo and behold, I got a Washington assignment. I was
                    assigned to a program that then existed, known as the junior officer rotational
                    program. They had it at posts abroad, but they also had a counterpart of it in
                    the State Department. I was told that I was being assigned to what was then
                    known as the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is central to the overall topic of the Abba Schwartz
                        Foundation study of visas. Tell us what that Bureau meant, how much security
                        was or wasn't part of it, and how it relates to the present Bureau of
                        Consular Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs had been created in 1952 by
                    the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It was a statutorily created
                    bureau. It had in it, and the law also included in it, the Visa Office and the
                    Passport Office. Those were the only two elements that the law actually
                    specified were required to be included in it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Protection of Americans in jails, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SCULLY: The Office of Special Consular Services was also part of the bureau, but
                    it was not statutorily decreed to be part of the bureau. As I came to know the
                    story—and at the time that my assignment was made, I didn't know any of this—the
                    bureau was created by the Congress over the protests of the Executive Branch. It
                    was created for the express purpose of creating a bureau in the department that
                    would be more under Congressional control than an administratively created
                    bureau. It was intended to have control not only over what we now call consular
                    work, but it also was intended to have control over the Office of Security,
                    which is where the name Security came from.</p>

                <p>SCULLY: Primarily, in those days, security clearances and protection of the
                    Secretary of State. The issue of international terrorism really didn't exist in
                    that form in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were bodyguards, and “Don't be a commie” sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because of [Senator Joseph] McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. A lot of this was related to the McCarthy period, and it must be
                    understood, in order to have a sense of what was going on and how this came
                    about, President Truman vetoed the Immigration and Nationality Act, and a
                    Democratic Congress overrode his veto. He was much vilified for this. He was
                    much admired in liberal circles for having vetoed it, much vilified by others
                    for having vetoed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did he veto it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He vetoed it for several reasons. First of all, he vetoed it because of
                    the national origins quota system which he objected to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the first time a quota was set up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, this was perpetuating quotas that had been set up many years before.
                    Truman felt strongly that the quota system should be abolished, that it was
                    racially discriminatory and unworthy of us and unsuitable for us in that day and
                    time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was sort of his liberal pleasure in his vetoing
                        it; he was speaking out for equity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. He also vetoed it because the '52 act codified and expanded upon
                    provisions excluding communists and other “subversives,” which had really had
                    their origins back at the end of the First World War, but which had not been as
                    all-encompassing, detailed, as tightly drawn as many of the people in those
                    times, in that period of extreme anxiety over communism, wanted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remind the reader, 1952, 1953.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Correct. So this was the bureau. The bureau was created as part of that
                    instrument. At the time I was assigned to it, I really didn't know anything
                    about it other than I knew two things. First of all, as Americans know, this is
                    a nation of immigrants. We all know that. We learned that in school. So I knew
                    that. I also knew, or thought I knew, that the 1952 act, which was referred to
                    as the McCarran-Walter Act, was a nefarious McCarthyite document that all
                    right-thinking liberals, especially people who grew up in the New Deal,
                    abhorred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You thought these thoughts because of your family
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. This is the intellectual and political milieu in which I had grown
                    up. So I must say I was a little bemused by the notion that I was going to be
                    assigned to this bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Act was fully in force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. Remember now, this is ten years after the enactment of the act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the boss then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: At that time, the Administrator, as the title was then called, was Abba
                    Schwartz, whose name I heard initially when I was first assigned to the
                    bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long had he been on board when you came on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Only a matter of months, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He succeeded whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He succeeded Salvatore Bontempo, and Mr. Bontempo had been Mr. Kennedy's
                    first appointment to this job. I was told that Mr. Bontempo lasted about six or
                    eight months, and then at Christmas of 1961, he informed his staff that he was
                    going home for Christmas vacation and would be back after New Year's, and never
                    returned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his qualifications in the first place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That I do not know. He was gone by the time I got there, but there was
                    some folklore about Mr. Bontempo. Apparently in the spring of 1962 or maybe in
                    the early summer of 1962, Mr. Schwartz was appointed to succeed him, so that by
                    the time I came out of the basic junior officers course, followed by French,
                    followed by the old consular course, and actually reported to the bureau to
                    start my two-year assignment in the summer, in July of 1962, Schwartz was
                    already on board. I don't know how long he had been there. I doubt that it had
                    been more than three or four months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a rotational officer in this bureau. What did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The schedule that I had laid out for me was that I would spend six months
                    in each of the four major constituent offices—the Visa Office, the Passport
                    Office, the Office of Special Consular Services, and the Office of Refugee and
                    Migration Affairs, which was then part of the Bureau of Security and Consular
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was it separated from that bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not too long thereafter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Not too long thereafter. So in July 1962, I reported to the Visa Office
                    for the first of what was supposed to be my four six-month stints in each of
                    these four offices to complete the two-year tour. I did several things during
                    those six months. I worked for a while in the telephone inquiries branch, which
                    was also public inquiries branch. It was in the north lobby of the main State
                    Department building. We received not only telephone calls from the public, but
                    walk-ins from the public, because there weren't any building guards and there
                    weren't any passes. There was a very nice receptionist who directed people to
                    wherever they wanted to go, but there was no security in terms of scrutinizing
                    your credentials for entry. People just entered.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We won't get into the changes that have taken place in
                        thirty years, but that's probably one of the more dramatic ones. What kind
                        of queries were these? Were these people who wanted their relative to get to
                        the United States faster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. They were all the standard kinds of inquiries. “How does my relative
                    get a visa?” “Why didn't my relative get a visa?” “What does this form mean?”
                    “What do I do?” “If I want my friend to visit me, how do I go about that?” “My
                    cousin would like to come and live with me in New York. What should I do?” “Why
                    won't the consul let my cousin from Italy come and visit me in New York?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or, “The consul has declared my cousin to be a
                        communist”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, we didn't get so much of that. Not so much in the telephone inquiries
                    and walk-ins. That tended to come in more by letter and through congressionals
                    and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressionals being our term for letters from members of
                        Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. One of the interesting things we did get, if you recall that period,
                    this was about a year after the Bay of Pigs invasion. The Bay of Pigs was in the
                    spring of 1961. This is now the summer, early fall of 1962, just before the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis. There was a very, very, very heavy outflow of Cubans from
                    Cuba still coming to the United States, and there was a whole series of special
                    rules that had been set up, and an awful lot of our inquiries were specifically
                    about, “How do I get my uncle from Cuba here?” One of the ironies was I had just
                    finished studying French and had come out with a 3+3+, and the language I needed
                    was Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which you learned quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I learned a certain basic Spanish vocabulary, because there were certain
                    repetitive questions and repetitive answers that you could pick up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel Abba Schwartz's presence in that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, not in that job. It was too far down the ladder for me to feel his
                    presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you knew he was the boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, I knew he was the boss. We all knew he was the administrator. But I
                    was only in the Visa Office from July until January, and I worked in that
                    division, I worked in the written inquiries unit for a while, answering letters.
                    I'll give you a little sidelight on that. The first thing that I was taught when
                    I went into the written inquiries unit was how to forge the signature of the
                    director of the Visa Office, because in those days congressional letters on visa
                    matters were signed by the director of the Visa Office, unless he felt they had
                    to go upstairs to the Administrator. They were not signed in the Office of
                    Congressional Relations. That's a change in the way the department does
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We should explain that now every letter that goes to a
                        congressman must be signed by the Office of Congressional Relations, not
                        that they especially understand what they're signing, but that is the
                        tradition which has been now for maybe fifteen years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Actually, that change was made in 1963, and I was collaterally involved
                    in the outcome of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to your final days in the Visa Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I had this six-month tour. I also spent a brief time during those six
                    months in what was known as the Cuban Visa Waiver Processing Office. This was an
                    office that processed applications for authorizing the entry of Cubans under
                    these special rules that had been set up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things haven't changed much, then, have they? Special
                        rules for special circumstances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. The players change, but the game doesn't change all that
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reality doesn't change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I spent my six months getting some experience in each of these three
                    things. Then in January, I went over to the Passport Office to start my
                    six-month tour over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, the Passport Office was headed by a woman of
                        great renown.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. She was a well-known public figure, shall we say. Frances G. Knight
                    was one of the more formidable political figures in Washington for probably
                    twenty-five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little bit more to the uninformed reader: Why was she so
                        formidable and how did she get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The Passport Office had a very interesting history. It was run by a woman
                    named Miss Shipley, generally known as “Ma” Shipley, from the 1920s till the
                    1950s, when Miss Shipley retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thirty years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. She was there from somewhere around '25, '26, '27, along in that
                    vicinity, up until '55. Frances Knight had started out, I gather, as a New
                    Dealer, and had come to Washington as a young woman in the 1930s, but like a
                    certain number of people who started out in the New Deal, they started veering
                    toward the right. She wound up, I am told, as a very close associate of Senator
                    Styles Bridges of New Hampshire, who was a well-known conservative Republican of
                    those days. In the Eisenhower administration, when the first Administrator came
                    to the job in 1953, Scott McLeod, the first administrator of the bureau, he
                    brought Miss Knight with him as a special assistant. So she was his special
                    assistant for a couple of years until Miss Shipley retired. Then he appointed
                    her director of the Passport Office to replace Miss Shipley. She was a woman of
                    great political acumen and wide political contacts, and she cultivated her
                    political contacts very, very carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just because it was part of her nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think it was part of her nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A political animal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was a very political animal. Her husband, Wayne Parrish, was a very
                    powerful man in the aviation industry. He published Aviation Week magazine. I
                    think at one point he was president of the Air Transport Association. He was
                    sort of an aviation pioneer, and was a very, very powerful man in the aviation
                    and travel industry. So she had quite wide political contacts and influences
                    through that. The Passport Office was a natural sort of companion to the travel
                    industry, etc., because, obviously, if you're going to travel abroad, you have

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To bring this up to date, we should say that Frances
                        Knight's husband has now died and she has had a series of serious illnesses
                        and strokes. My understanding is she is near her demise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I understand she, while still alive, is almost totally disabled and
                    unable to speak because of the stroke she had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had the good fortune of being assigned to
                        her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Again, I was assigned into the Passport Office in a very junior job, way
                    below her level. Again, you heard these various things, but they didn't really
                    mean anything to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I worked in the Washington Passport Office processing passport
                    applications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A line job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: A line job. I don't know what ever would have followed that, because
                    after I had been in that job for about three weeks, I got a telephone message
                    that the Executive Director of the Bureau, the chief administrative officer of
                    the bureau, wanted to see me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: A fellow named Sy Levinson, Seymour Levinson. He was a Foreign Service
                    officer. I believe he was an administrative specialist. He was assigned as the
                    executive director, or chief administrative officer of the bureau. He had
                    interviewed me once while I was in the Visa Office, and it was a very routine
                    interview, just, “How do you like it? Do you feel you're learning anything?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had responsibilities over you as a rotational officer,
                        for two-year training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. So I assumed that this was just another routine interview, and I
                    went up to his office at the appointed time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never trust an executive officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Executive director. That's right. So I went in, and he sat me down.
                    Instead of giving me a routine interview, he said, “Mr. Schwartz needs a staff
                    assistant and he doesn't have one. You're going to be his staff assistant. Would
                    you please go upstairs and see Mr. Mace, the senior deputy administrator, and he
                    will explain to you what it is he wants done and give you all the particulars.”
                    So he took me upstairs and introduced me to Charlie Mace, who was a career
                    Foreign Service officer, primarily an admin officer, I think, in his career, but
                    he was the senior deputy.</p>
                <p>I was introduced to Mr. Mace, and Mr. Mace explained that before Mr. Schwartz had
                    arrived, there had been a great reduction in force in the size of the Bureau
                    front office, the Administrator's immediate office staff, and that there was no
                    staff assistant, and they were in serious need of a staff assistant. It had been
                    decided that I should fill that job. He explained to me that my job was to
                    control the paper flow and see to it that Mr. Schwartz and he, Mace, and the
                    other deputy, Ed Lyerly, saw everything they needed to see, but were never
                    bothered with anything they didn't need to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he describe Mr. Schwartz as a person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, he didn't describe Mr. Schwartz as a person, as a matter of fact. I
                    was introduced to Mr. Schwartz later that same day, obviously. I subsequently
                    discovered why he perhaps forbore to describe Mr. Schwartz. I later discovered
                    that one of the reasons that I was picked for this job. I pieced this together,
                    because nobody told me this per se, but I pieced it together from other
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's part of the Foreign Service, isn't it? You're
                        supposed to be deductive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Right. I was in this junior officer rotational program, and, as such, I
                    was on the payroll, or on the staffing pattern, of the Personnel Bureau. I was
                    not charged against the personnel ceiling for the bureau in which I was
                    working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a “freebie”.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I was a freebie. You got it. That's exactly right. Mr. Schwartz, it
                    turned out, was in a big political fight with Frances Knight over a whole array
                    of things, and one of the things she was charging him with was waste and
                    empire-building and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was appointed by the president.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SCULLY: He was appointed by President Kennedy. You must understand that Miss
                    Knight's power transcended political parties. She was politically close to
                    members of Congress that ranged all the way from J. William Fulbright on the
                    left, to Carl Mundt on the right, passing through Hubert Humphrey somewhere in
                    between.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Congress, and then there are those who understand
                        that Mr. J. Edgar Hoover played a role in this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was very closely wired in to J. Edgar Hoover, and I'll never forget
                    the day that Abba &amp; Co. discovered that since she had come on board in 1955,
                    she had had a direct telephone from her desk to J. Edgar Hoover's, and no one
                    else in the Department of State knew that up until one day when Mr. Schwartz
                    accidentally discovered it and had the phone disconnected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was allowed into her office and he was allowed to
                        disconnect it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I don't remember how he discovered this. I can't remember the
                    circumstances of how this came to light, but I remember its coming to light, and
                    everyone, not merely in the Bureau front office, but I think even up on the
                    Seventh Floor, being stupefied at the thought that the director of the Passport
                    Office could pick up a phone on her desk and get J. Edgar Hoover to pick up his
                    at the other end. It was that kind of a direct, almost hot-line phone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you speculate they talked about on that hot
                        line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: They were both strong, visceral anti-communists. Frances Knight
                    controlled the issuance of passports for foreign travel. J. Edgar Hoover had
                    great investigative interest in foreign travel of people he considered to be
                    subversives. I think they collaborated on these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She would prevent passport issuance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Or feed him information about passport issuances and back and forth. I
                    think there was a very close exchange of information back and forth that flowed
                    between the two of them. At least that is the impression one has always
                    gotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Abba Schwartz's entry into this “tiger's
                        nest”.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SCULLY: In any event, I was essentially told that would be my job. I was not
                    given a secretary. Obviously I couldn't be given a secretary because I didn't
                    exist on the staffing pattern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also you were but a junior officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Nonetheless, I desperately needed a secretary, because I had the duty of
                    controlling everything that went into that office and everything that went out
                    of that office, both as to timing and making sure that the right people saw
                    things, that deadlines got met, that paper got vetted. I had 100 percent
                    responsibility for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it, then, that you were hired to this job, in fact,
                        worked with Abba Schwartz for a while. Let's now hear more about it. Tell us
                        what you did there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: If you know the complex of offices that makes up Room 6811, it's a series
                    of offices that run laterally. At one end is the now Assistant Secretary's
                    office, then called the administrator's office, and it runs from that point in a
                    westerly direction, and there are about six or seven offices that make up that
                    complex. Initially, I was put in an office down at the far end, all the way at
                    the other end from the Administrator's office, with some people who had been
                    held over from the prior administration. By that I mean from Bontempo; I don't
                    mean from the Eisenhower administration. I mean from the prior regime. Very nice
                    people who were very helpful and very friendly, but who were basically just
                    sitting there until they could be placed elsewhere. As is customary when you get
                    a new Assistant Secretary, the people who have worked for the old one very
                    frequently move on or are moved on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are political appointees or career people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Some were political and some were career. One of them was a fellow named
                    Lawson Moyer, who was a career officer, whose primary involvement was with
                    security matters and things like that. Another one was a man named Michel
                    Cieplinski, who started out as a political appointee, but, interestingly enough,
                    is still around the Department of State. I see him still, even though he is in
                    his middle eighties. He was Acting Administrator in the interim between the
                    departure of Bontempo and the arrival of Schwartz. When Schwartz came, he was a
                    fifth wheel and he was only there for a few months until they got him placed
                    elsewhere. His primary function was liaison with the East European ethnics in
                    this country and also the care and feeding of Congressman John Rooney. Mr.
                    Rooney was chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee of the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee in those days, which controlled the State Department
                    appropriations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was “Mr. Power”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: “Mr. Power.” That's correct. I stayed down there at the far end for about
                    three or four months until one day I was informed that Mr. Schwartz couldn't
                    operate effectively with me that far away from him. Therefore, I was going to be
                    moved into what is now the Consular Affairs Bureau conference room, which is
                    immediately adjacent to the Assistant Secretary's office. In those days, it
                    wasn't a conference room; it was an office that was shared by me and a very nice
                    black man named Frank Better, who was the messenger. He delivered mail, and
                    since I handled the mail, it worked fine for the two of us to share an
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us your impressions of Abba Schwartz over the period
                        you were with him. What was the period? Tell us how you saw him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I went up there in January of 1963. I spent several months down at the
                    other end of the complex, as I indicated, so this was probably the spring of
                    1963 that I moved down to this office immediately outside his office which had a
                    communicating door. I was there from that point until the summer of 1964, when I
                    was assigned overseas. In those days, I was a Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Waiting for your first foreign assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I had this two-year tour to complete in Washington. Then in the summer of
                    1964, I went off to France. So I was down there immediately next to him for
                    probably fifteen months. I saw him every day, a number of times every day. He
                    was a very, very pleasant and affable man. He could not have been kinder to me.
                    He had two characteristics, I think, that caused him serious problems as a
                    government bureaucrat, even as a political appointee.</p>
                <p>First, his work habits were very disorderly. He flitted from thing to thing; his
                    attention was easily diverted. He simply did not fit well into a bureaucratic
                    system which had highly standardized routine and channels of communication. He
                    would, for example, pop into my office—next door to his—and go through the
                    incoming mail on my desk. If something caught his attention he would simply take
                    it away with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>He once did this with a memo from one of the regional bureaus, before I had even
                    seen it or had a chance to record its arrival. Later, the regional bureau called
                    to ask when they would expect and answer. I had no idea what they were talking
                    about, of course. I asked everyone in the office, including Schwartz himself,
                    about the memo. Everyone, including Schwartz, denied ever having seen it or
                    heard of it. Only several days later, after much additional to-ing and fro-ing,
                    did Schwartz recall that he had indeed taken the memo off my desk, walked down
                    to the office of the Legal Adviser with it and passed it on to a Deputy Legal
                    Adviser for comment.</p>
                <p>His other problem in that position was his unwillingness to coordinate with other
                    interested offices—obtain necessary clearance, in our in-house jargon. Now,
                    anyone who has ever worked in a bureaucracy, wherever it might be, has faced
                    this problem and been frustrated by it. One hates to be told that one's
                    carefully developed plan will have collateral effects which one hadn't seen,
                    etc. And, of course, the process can be carried too far—degenerate into mindless
                    word games or interminable theological disputes. Nevertheless, one must come to
                    terms with this, if one is to function effectively in a bureaucratic structure.
                    Schwartz wouldn't.</p>
                <p>Once, for example, he had personally drafted a telegram on some important issue
                    or other. It was also important to the European Bureau and the Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs, Ambassador Tyler Thompson, was listed for
                    clearance of the telegram. Thompson's office called to report that he wanted
                    certain changes. The secretary informed Mr. Schwartz of this and he instructed
                    her to delete Thompson's name from the telegram and send it as he had drafted
                    it. His attitude was that, if Thompson wouldn't agree with him on the matter, he
                    would ignore him.</p>
                <p>These characteristics inhibited his effectiveness and, I think, also contributed
                    to his political downfall in 1966.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: As I understand it, it was. He had been in the Navy during the Second
                    World War, but I don't really think that counts in the same way we're talking
                    about being a bureaucrat. He had been very political. As I understand it, he had
                    been a prot�g� of Eleanor Roosevelt before the Second World War. After the
                    Second World War, he had been much involved in refugee matters and worked with
                    the International Refugee Organization, but I don't think he ever had a regular
                    bureaucratic position, even politically appointed, before he took this
                    particular job.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SCULLY: That I'm not quite sure. I've read some books on Mrs. Roosevelt and the
                    Roosevelts, and I've read Joseph Lash's books. There were a lot of young men who
                    came out of college in those days who were greatly attracted to the New Deal, to
                    the Roosevelts, to things like the National Youth Administration, and a number
                    of these other organizations. Mrs. Roosevelt was sort of the sponsor and patron
                    of a lot of these organizations, and I think she attracted people who were
                    young, just out of college, liberal, looking for ways to improve the world. I
                    think she attracted people like that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he associated with a company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, he was associated with a firm at one point. There was a guy named
                    Jim Landis, who was very well known in the New Deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, in Washington. There was also a firm called Surrey &amp; Kavasih here
                    in Washington that he had been associated with at one point. I think Walter
                    Surrey was, again, much of that same generation, much of that same political
                    philosophy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I'm not quite sure how he became connected with the Kennedy family, but
                    he was personally connected with the Kennedy family. He knew Bobby Kennedy
                    personally. I think he probably knew President Jack Kennedy as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His appointment obviously came through a Kennedy

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Perhaps not entirely. Because of his association with Eleanor Roosevelt,
                    he had maintained a relationship with her. He was a prot�g� of hers, or well
                    known to her, and also I think because of his work in refugee matters, he had
                    become quite well known and very much connected with Congressman Walter of
                    Pennsylvania, who was one of the authors of the 1952 Immigration Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Liberal Democrat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Mr. Walter was not that much of a liberal. He was a Democrat, but he was
                    not that much of a liberal Democrat. Mr. Schwartz knew him, knew him quite well,
                    and seemed to be on extremely good terms with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got the appointment as the administrator, and there you
                        were as his staff aide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: As I say, he was a very affable man, always in a good humor. He was very
                    kind to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Always in a good humor? He never blew up at you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Not at me nor in my presence. He may well have had moments when he became
                    highly exercised and infuriated about things and become seriously angered, but I
                    don't recall ever experiencing that. He was a man of very good humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his motivations? What drove him the most, as you
                        saw him as his staff assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SCULLY: I think what drove him, in a political/philosophical way was a very
                    strong liberal motivation. I think he wanted to open up our immigration system,
                    he wanted to overcome a lot of what were perceived to be very narrow views and
                    approaches that the 1952 Immigration Act and its predecessors reflected. He had
                    two major accomplishments in the field of immigration. Under the Immigration
                    Act, aliens who were members of, or affiliated with, communist organizations
                    were excluded from admission. Now, when for an alien who was seeking to enter
                    temporarily, the law did authorize that ineligibility, that excludability, to be
                    waived. Throughout the period from the enactment of the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act in '52 up until the advent of the Kennedy administration, that
                    provision was implemented narrowly—a waiver would not be recommended to permit
                    the temporary entry of someone who was excludable because of a communist
                    affiliation unless there was an affirmative reason, unless the government could
                    find an affirmative reason to do so. This meant that the majority of application
                    waivers were never granted, because if there had to be an affirmative reason to
                    support permitting someone to enter, it was much easier and much simpler just to
                    say, “Well, there isn't any affirmative reason. Therefore, we won't.” One of the
                    things that President Kennedy wanted done, and which Mr. Schwartz achieved, was
                    to absolutely reverse the whole approach to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel Kennedy really wanted this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I'm given to understand that this was one of the things that President
                    Kennedy instructed Schwartz to bring about—a change in that perception. It was
                    not possible at that time, I think, to change the law, but it was possible to
                    change the way in which this waiver provision was applied, the approach that was
                    given to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this really now bring us towards the subject at hand,
                        the visa function, how visas are granted or denied?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is the administrator of the visa issuance process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. It was at Schwartz's direction that in 1963 the instructions on
                    that issue were rewritten 180 degrees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Attorney General, as I understand the law, is the
                        real mentor of the interpretation of the act.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SCULLY: That, of course, is true in the sense that all the State Department can
                    do, for example, in this particular aspect of the law is to recommend that the
                    alien be permitted to enter in spite of his ineligibility. Only the Attorney
                    General can ultimately approve that recommendation. Remember, the Attorney
                    General in those days was Bobby Kennedy, the president's brother. So the two of
                    them were working on this quite closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Mr. Schwartz was not doing this willy-nilly under
                        instruction of the president; he knew that there was the other part of the
                        triangle or angle that it was going to work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. He was obviously a close personal friend of Attorney General
                    Bobby Kennedy. I had occasion to observe him in his office talking to Kennedy on
                    the phone. One of the more wonderful incidents that occurred, it doesn't have
                    anything to do with the waivers and ineligibility, but it does say something
                    about power and how things get done and Mr. Schwartz's relationships. On a
                    certain day, the Countess Tolstoy, who was a granddaughter of the famous writer
                    Tolstoy, came to see Mr. Schwartz with a very sad story about what she referred
                    to as the Old Believers. These were ethnic Russians who, in the seventeenth
                    century, had resisted a reform in the Russian Orthodox Church and had been
                    persecuted for resisting this reform. This small group of perhaps a few hundred
                    or a few thousand, it was a small group of sort of die-hard resisters in the
                    face of the persecution by the Orthodox Church for their refusal to accept the
                    reforms, had left Russia and had moved into a remote area of Turkey, where they
                    had lived relatively peaceably, I gather, for nearly three centuries. But they
                    had reached a point at which in their isolation in this Muslim country, they had
                    intermarried to the point that they were faced with either perpetuating
                    themselves by marrying within prohibited degrees within the church or marrying
                    amongst the local population and, therefore, being absorbed into the Muslim
                    population and disappearing as a group.</p>
                <p>The countess was most anxious that something should be done for this remaining
                    group, and she proposed that they be granted admission into the United States,
                    and she would resettle them and they would be able to maintain their community
                    and there would be other Russians that they could marry, etc., and it would
                    preserve this group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they couldn't come under normal visas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: They couldn't come under the normal immigration system at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SCULLY: They weren't actually refugees either, in the proper sense. They were a
                    category that really simply didn't quite fit. They didn't fit under the normal
                    immigration system, they didn't really quite fit properly as refugees because
                    they weren't threatened by the Turks. They were threatened by something else,
                    not by political persecution, not by religious persecution, or any of the things
                    that would normally make one a refugee, but they were threatened with extinction
                    because of the situation in which they found themselves. They were threatened
                    with extinction as a community, as a distinct community, not as individuals. So
                    it was one of these situations that you couldn't really properly categorize
                    anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe like the Armenians felt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, perhaps. In any event, the countess came to see Mr. Schwartz and
                    made an impassioned plea for some assistance from the U.S. government. So
                    Schwartz decided that he was going to respond to this, and I'll never forget it.
                    The first thing he did was to call Congressman Walter, to explain this problem
                    to Congressman Walter, and to say that he recommended that they be granted
                    parole, to be paroled into the United States for humanitarian reasons, which is
                    a legally permissible thing to do. Mr. Walter's response was that he would have
                    no objection to it as long as the Attorney General agreed to it. Mr. Schwartz
                    assured him that the Attorney General had, in fact, agreed to it, whereupon Mr.
                    Walters said, “In that case, it's fine with me. I have no objection to this
                    being done. That's fine.”</p>
                <p>The next call Schwartz made was to the Attorney General, and he gave essentially
                    the same story to the Attorney General. The Attorney General said to him, “I'm
                    perfectly willing to do this as long as it's okay with Congressman Walter.” And
                    Schwartz assured him that, yes, indeed, it certainly was okay with Congressman
                    Walter, so Bobby Kennedy said that was fine with him and he'd go along with it
                    and would approve it. Schwartz completed the transaction.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking at the time that this was sort of high-rolling, high-risk
                    game-playing, but I guess Mr. Schwartz knew what he was doing because he knew
                    his people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought you said you came from a political family.
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: [Laughter] Well, I got some real insights into how the game was
                    played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there as a junior officer trying to learn the
                        realities of being a good public servant. Mr. Schwartz, you're saying to me,

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SCULLY: I've thought back on those days, and I have had occasion to think that I
                    learned things working for him as a very brand-new junior officer that probably
                    it would be better if one learned incrementally over a much longer part of your
                    career. Remember that I'd only been in the Foreign Service about a year when I
                    went up there to become his staff assistant. I'm not sure it's necessarily a
                    good thing when you're twenty-five, twenty-six years old, in your first year of
                    government service, to learn all those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My first assignment was staff aide to our ambassador in
                        Paris, where I learned a lot of these things, too. Maybe it's good to learn
                        it early. I don't know. Do you think he was dishonest? Did you walk away
                        from that situation and, in retrospect, do you think he was dishonest,
                        immoral, or unethical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Oh, no, indeed. That's not at all what I'm saying. I think there are
                    certain realities of the way the political game is played that are perhaps not
                    consistent with an idealistic notion of the way the political game is
                    played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His instruction was from the president of the United
                        States, with the agreement of the Attorney General, the president's brother,
                        to get on with some changes that were necessary to the 1952 Act, which the
                        president of the United States, duly elected, felt were wrong. Secondly, he
                        had an obstacle out there that he felt was a veritable obstacle to
                        accomplishment of that, and that was Frances Knight, albeit a different part
                        of the argument. So what I'm hearing is that Abba Schwartz stepped in there
                        under instructions with obstacles and proceeded, ethically, to do what he
                        thought was correct.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, I think that's right. I think that's a fair statement, Bill. It
                    caused him some fairly serious political problems at a lower level. For example,
                    the change in the policy on waivers, there were people in the Visa Office who
                    strongly, strongly opposed that. Frank Auerbach, who was Deputy Director of the
                    Visa Office, in his day he was a legendary figure. He died in 1966, I think,
                    quite suddenly of a heart attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wrote the book.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SCULLY: He wrote one of the books. He contributed to writing the 1952 act. He was
                    a special consultant to the Immigration Subcommittee before he came over to the
                    State Department. He was a very strange man, but a very powerful man and a very
                    conservative man. He and some of the other people in the Visa Office, I think,
                    felt that Schwartz was betraying the security of the United States. Again, this
                    is all part of that McCarthy thing. I don't know this firsthand, but I'm led to
                    believe, and I think it's almost certainly true, that Auerbach and a couple of
                    the other people who were like-minded in the Visa Office went and took their
                    tale of woe to one Jay Sourwine, who, again, in his day was notorious. He was
                    the chief staffer for the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. He was
                    connected with Senator Eastman. He had been connected with Senator McCarthy and
                    Senator Jenner, and some of the better-known pro-McCarthy senators of that
                    earlier period. Jay Sourwine took out after Schwartz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he do him in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, he did not do him in. He was not able to do him in, but he made life
                    difficult for Schwartz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stop for just a moment and jump to 1992. In looking
                        back, with that as an example. We have policies given to us by our
                        presidents, by our administrations. We, as public servants, follow those
                        instructions, guidance. But we might not agree with each and every one—take
                        the consular area, for example. We have differences. Would you like to give
                        a few words of philosophy, if you will? As someone who has gone through this
                        for thirty-plus years, of different administrations, different ideological
                        beliefs, with different methodologies, including running up to the Hill and
                        ratting on a boss, would you like to philosophize a bit on this now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: It's a difficult subject, Bill. I've seen this go on. I was too junior at
                    the time to be really directly involved in the things that were going on with
                    Schwartz. I was a minion. I've become more senior since, and I've gotten
                    involved much more operationally and substantively in things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In different administrations, with different leaders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. I think the first thing that you have to try to do as a bureaucrat
                    is make sure that people are given to understand clearly, “These are the things
                    you legally can do and these are the things you legally can't do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Legally, under the law.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Under the law. Laws have certain limits, and depending on how carefully
                    the laws are drafted, the limits are broader or narrower, but there's always
                    some outer limit beyond which you really can't go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mr. Auerbach, for example, go beyond that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, I don't think he did. His was a philosophical question. I think the
                    way the law was written there, it was legally permissible to interpret it
                    narrowly, it was legally permissible to interpret it in a broad sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The law was written that way on purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think the law perhaps was written that way, yes. Whether it was done by
                    design or whether it just came out that way is sometimes quite difficult to
                    ascertain. One of the things I've found over the years is that in many cases
                    what might appear to the outside observer to have been intended by the Congress
                    and very carefully thought through by the Congress, in fact, wasn't. So that's a
                    very difficult question to say whether it was purposeful or not, but the fact
                    is, the net result of their drafting was a provision which gave one very broad
                    latitude. It essentially said, “You can recommend and grant these waivers in
                    your discretion.” That's very, very broad. The policy that had been adopted,
                    that had been followed up to the Kennedy administration was to use that
                    discretion very narrowly and have a very rigorous test.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically to exclude people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: To exclude people and only to admit them with a very strong affirmative
                    reason. Someone had to come forward with an affirmative argument, “We really
                    must let this bad communist in, even though he's a bad communist, because it's
                    affirmatively in our interest to let that bad communist in.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're using the word “communist,” but there were other
                        exclusions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it generally a negative period? “Keep people
                        out”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SCULLY: I'm not so sure it was generally a negative period if you had somebody
                    that might have had a criminal record ten years before or something like that,
                    but certainly with respect to people whose excludability derived from communist
                    affiliation, it was very negative.</p>
                <p>Schwartz had, as a goal—and I am told that this did come, in fact, from the
                    President—to change that policy and open it up. In fact, he did that. Now, Frank
                    Auerbach and some of his other people strongly disagreed with the propriety of
                    doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this guidance from Schwartz, interpreted by a
                        subordinate, giving out instructions to the field, come to the field? What
                        did the Consul General in London do with this apparently contrary...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: In 1963, there was a rewrite of the instructions on this, and the revised
                    instruction said that where an alien is excludable because of a communist
                    affiliation, the government will ordinarily grant him temporary entry under this
                    waiver unless there is an affirmative reason to keep him out. That was the
                    instruction that was written and distributed to the field at that time pursuant
                    to Schwartz's orders. Auerbach strongly disagreed with that. He couldn't do
                    anything about the fact that the instruction had to be sent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director of the Visa Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The director of the Visa Office was Allen Moreland, a very fine man whom
                    I knew slightly at the time, and have come to know much better since. He was in
                    a very awkward position, because he was carrying out Schwartz's instructions and
                    he himself was being sabotaged by his deputy, Frank Auerbach, who had very
                    powerful Capitol Hill connections and was not somebody you could just summarily
                    dismiss. Mr. Moreland has said to me subsequently that he was in a very bad
                    position because Schwartz became convinced that Moreland was part of the
                    problem, and didn't really understand that Moreland was trapped between
                    Schwartz, on the one hand, and Frank Auerbach, on the other hand. Schwartz
                    tended to perceive Al Moreland as part of the problem, and Moreland has always
                    said to me—and I believe it, because Moreland is an extremely honorable man, he
                    really is one of the most honorable men I've ever encountered—that that was
                    simply not the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds to me, in our business, in the Foreign Service,
                        in the State Department, that this is one of those wonderful opportunities
                        where you got transferred overseas. Is this a good time now to go overseas?
                        Tell us what you did next.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SCULLY: There were many adventures and “backings and forthings” in that fifteen
                    months. I had a great deal of fun with Mr. Schwartz. If we weren't focusing so
                    much on visas, I would talk a little more about Frances Knight and some of the
                    machinations there. But the time did come, obviously, when the two-year period
                    that I was assigned to spend in the Department expired.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1964, I was informed that I had been assigned to the American
                    consulate in Nice, France, as the vice consul. So in July of 1964, I and my
                    first wife departed and went to Nice. At that point, I sort of lost track of
                    what was going on in detail in the bureau, and became much more involved in life
                    in France and my function as a vice consul there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Princess Grace and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is a separate story, but let's keep the visa thread.
                        You issued visas in Nice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. Nice was a small post, only a two-officer post. We did not issue
                    immigrant visas, but we did issue non-immigrant visas. We had a small, but
                    relatively regular flow of non-immigrant applicants, obviously primarily
                    tourists, but the occasional student and a few exchange visitor visa applicants.
                    We had the headquarters of IBM France in the Nice consular district, in a little
                    town about fifteen miles to the west of Nice, and they had a very active
                    exchange visitor program that they ran within their company for transferring
                    junior executives over to IBM headquarters for various kinds of management
                    training and that sort of thing. So we used to get those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But none of this heady stuff that you'd been engaged in in
                        Washington really applied to your non-immigrant visa work in Nice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, not really. We also had an absolutely wonderful visa clerk, Foreign
                    Service national employee. She was the Countess Olga Filatiev. She was the niece
                    of the last head of the Imperial Russian Army Officers Association in Paris, who
                    was murdered by the KGB in 1937, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she certainly knew how to handle any communist
                        applicants who would come in the front door. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SCULLY: She once said to me, we were discussing Kerensky, the last premier of
                    Russia before the Bolsheviks took over in the fall of 1917, and I made the
                    comment to her that Mr. Kerensky was living in New York or in the United States,
                    in any event, and she looked at me with a very gentle smile and she said, “Well,
                    you know, we believe that he's the one that brought the communists in.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The Countess Olga Filatiev was at the other end of that spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She, Auerbach, and Frances Knight might have had a lot in
                        common. Then you went on to Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: In 1966, yes, I went to Montreal. There I was assigned specifically to
                    the visa section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there you could get a direct feeling for what
                        Washington's policies and machinations meant to the field. Tell us about
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: It was very interesting. I arrived in Montreal in the fall of 1966. The
                    post was preparing for Expo '67, the World's Fair, which was held in Montreal
                    from April of 1967 through the fall of '67. I was assigned to the visa section.
                    There was much concern about volume. It was clear that there was going to be an
                    immense international attendance at Expo '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to now we've spoken mostly of substance of the visa
                        function, the admissibility issues, the details; the minutiae, if you will.
                        Now we're talking about the other half, which has become today an
                        overwhelming issue, and that is volume, the number of people moving to the
                        United States and wanting to come. You were struck by it in Montreal for the
                        first time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: For the first time it became an issue, because it seemed clear to us,
                    from everything the Canadians were saying about their expectations of attendance
                    at the World's Fair, there were going to be millions upon millions of
                    international visitors to Canada from all around the world, and we fully
                    anticipated that we were going to wind up with a major, major surge of visa
                    applicants from among all those people who would decide, “I'm already in Canada.
                    I want to go to the States.” They would not have gotten a visa in their home
                    country for whatever reason, and the expectation was that there was going to be
                    a gigantic avalanche of visa applicants.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all, they'd come all the way to Canada, and the
                        United States is only thirty, forty miles to the south.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Just so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe that's a good way to “sneak in the back door.” We
                        must remind the reader that Canadians do not need visas. We're only talking
                        about other nationalities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That was one of the problems that we faced, was that since Canadian
                    citizens didn't need visas, the normal flow of visa applicants in the consulate,
                    while there and meaningful in terms of people passing through Canada or
                    non-Canadian residents of the country, was radically smaller than it would have
                    been if Canadian citizens themselves had had to get visas. So the post was
                    staffed around what would ordinarily be a workload that was way below what the
                    population base in the district might normally have created if it had been a
                    country other than Canada.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The visa section in Montreal being maybe three officers
                        and ten Foreign Service nationals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Probably not more than that. I think there were two immigrant visa
                    officers plus a supervisor. So you had two non-immigrant visa officers, two
                    immigrant visa officers, and then the visa chief, and then maybe ten or so
                    Foreign Service nationals, ten to twelve. That's not really a very large staff.
                    It was quite appropriate for the volume that they had had without the influence
                    of the World's Fair, but this was the issue that we faced—what to do with this
                    anticipated huge surge?</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: We were downtown in the Stock Exchange Building. That had happened just
                    before I arrived in Montreal. They'd moved out of the Victorian complex up on
                    McGregor Avenue and they'd moved downtown to Pl�ce Victoria, which was the stock
                    exchange building. Only the visa section. The rest of the Consulate General was
                    still up the hill on McGregor Avenue, but the visa section was down at Place
                    Victoria on the ground floor of the stock exchange building. I think, in part,
                    that move had been made in anticipation of the World's Fair.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. One of the things that I encountered when I got to Montreal has
                    always fascinated me a bit. We were the second post in the Foreign Service to
                    receive the Automated Visa Lookout System, AVLOS. The first post was Toronto,
                    and that was because of the influence of the man I mentioned earlier, Mr.
                    Moreland. Mr. Moreland, while he was Director of the Visa office, had been one
                    of the pioneers in automation and was really the father of the AVLOS. When he
                    left the Visa Office, he became consul general in Toronto, so Toronto became the
                    first pilot post for AVLOS. We became the second post that went on line with
                    AVLOS, and Montreal was chosen as the second post precisely because of the
                    World's Fair and the idea that having an automated lookout system would
                    facilitate the processing of all these people.</p>
                <p>I remember Neal Parks, who was chief of the visa section, and I used to sit and
                    sort of fantasize about all the wonderful things we could do with AVLOS, and how
                    we could send administrative messages and we could send in requests for advisory
                    opinions and do this and do that and all the various things that one could do
                    with it. In fact, for a while we persuaded the Visa Office to let us do things
                    like that, so we were sending requests for advisory opinions by AVLOS messages
                    and all this sort of thing, until we got caught at it. Something happened, one
                    message went awry, and a congressional inquiry didn't get a response back, and
                    there was much storm, and then the people in the Communications Division
                    suddenly realized that here was this post abroad that was sending messages to
                    the State Department outside of normal communication channels, and they issued a
                    dictate that you couldn't do that anymore. So a lot of our wonderful plans went
                    right up in smoke at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you've given us the first example of the
                        difference between the field and the home office, and how the field has to
                        make things work, and not always is the home office satisfied with that. And
                        we're going to get you transferred after Montreal back to the home office,
                        where all kinds of behind-the-scenes things happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But first, more impressions of Montreal. This is your last overseas assignment.
                    What did you gain from this influx of visa applicants or other experiences in
                    Montreal you want to share with the reader?</p>
                <p>SCULLY: One of the things that struck me, as we were in the end of 1966 and
                    beginning of 1967, we were struggling to get sorted out and get ourselves
                    prepared for what we felt was going to be an onslaught, there was a series of
                    very strange triangular communications between Montreal and Ottawa, the embassy,
                    and the department over staffing, what staffing we would get, how many officers
                    we could expect, what we needed, and this kept going around and around. At a
                    given point, it finally became apparent that we were talking off different
                    pieces of paper.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The problem was the department was looking at a staffing pattern that they had
                    and saying, “There are already X number of officers assigned to the consular
                    section in Montreal.” Neal Parks and I were looking at the number of bodies that
                    actually reported to work every day in the visa section, and it was noticeably
                    smaller than what was on the staffing pattern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People were out sick, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, the slots were there, but the people weren't there or they were
                    slotted against the consular section, but actually were in other functions, or
                    maybe Ottawa had grabbed the position for something, and although the department
                    staffing pattern showed there was a slot in the consular section in Montreal, it
                    wasn't. I'll never forget, this finally came to the point that the DCM from
                    Ottawa, Joe Scott, and the administrative counselor and Will Chase, who was the
                    counselor for consular affairs—I can't remember the administrative counselor. I
                    think it was Idar Rimestad, as a matter of fact. Came down to Montreal to meet
                    with us to discuss this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Count bodies and heads?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. The consul general, Richard Hawkins, and Neal Parks, the chief
                    of the visa section, and I met with these three gentlemen, and we spent some
                    little time discussing this. It became apparent to me, as the discussion wore
                    on, that nobody who was participating in that discussion had a clear fix on what
                    Montreal's complement was, as opposed to how many people were there. I use the
                    word complement. I don't know if the State Department does. In the military, the
                    complement is the authorized number of slots. A ship's complement is the number
                    of personnel authorized to be assigned to that ship, as opposed to the number of
                    people that are actually there.</p>
                <p>One of the problems was that nobody had a clear fix on what Montreal's complement
                    was, and, therefore, nobody could figure out how many slots were filled, what
                    percentage of the slots were filled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Therefore, how many new ones you needed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. We had been saying we needed five officers, and the department
                    kept insisting we only needed three at most, and it finally became apparent that
                    the reason was they felt we had more people than we had. It was one of the most
                    bizarre exercises I was ever involved in, and I think it's something that is not
                    altogether overcome, even today, twenty-five years later. I still see some
                    anecdotal evidence that there are these misunderstandings between posts and the
                    department about, “What is the complement?” And, “Where is Junior Officer
                    Smith?” Junior Officer Smith is supposed to be in the consular section. That's
                    what the staffing pattern says. But the chief of the consular section says, “No,
                    Junior Officer Smith is working as the ambassador's aide. He's not in the
                    consular section.” Only the personnel people in Washington don't know that.
                    There's a great deal of that even today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My experience, picking up from that point and paralleling
                        yours back here in the Department, is not only is that true, but it's
                        magnified by ten, twenty, thirty times. Today we are so “understaffed,” we
                        are bringing in substitutes (call them whatever you may) in order to solve
                        this tremendous continuing burgeoning of the population. What you saw in
                        1966-67, over the next twenty, twenty-five years has been exactly the
                        same—failure to count the bodies correctly—but maybe even avoiding counting
                        the bodies correctly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That may very well be. This may not be an accident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you've discovered on tour two in the field
                        something that has continued and is probably far worse, and often becomes
                        the pushing force behind decisions that really shouldn't be personnel
                        oriented. Maybe you remember, Dick, Barbara Watson's expression at one point
                        where she had to issue a certain number of visas, called the Silva case, in
                        which all of a sudden hundreds and hundreds of visas had to be issued, and
                        the answer from the administration, from the management of the State
                        Department, was, “We don't have the bodies.” To which I remember well she
                        said, “Well, then you go to jail, Director General, for failing to carry out
                        the requirements. I'm not.” Personnel staffing, as you know, is vital.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: A couple of other anecdotal things that I think reflect problems that
                    still exist today. We were very experimental with AVLOS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is just the beginning of a whole series of highly
                        computerized advances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. You had a data entry clerk who sat at a terminal, and every visa
                    applicant's name was entered into the AVLOS system, typed in by the clerk, and
                    then certain keys were pushed, and what, in effect, was being done was that name
                    was being matched against the database of names of aliens who had been found
                    excludable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It typed it out on a long teletype-like, primitive, holed
                        piece of paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. It was typed out on an old tickertape that was run through the
                    machine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clunkers!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The system was fine within certain limits. But I'll never forget, on a
                    certain day we had a Portuguese applicant whose name was Gomes. So the operator
                    who ran the thing cut the tape and put Mr. Gomes' name into the system. The
                    printer started typing out all the Gomezes that were in the system. Needless to
                    say, all of them were Spanish Gomezes with Zs, and this was a Portuguese Gomes,
                    with an S. But it didn't discriminate well enough. Forty-five minutes later,
                    while it was still printing, I simply said, “Turn the machine off. We'll all go
                    to lunch.” It was approximately noon. “Eventually it will stop printing
                    Gomezes,” but it completely tied the whole system up for nearly an hour. I
                    issued an order. I was chief of the non-immigrant visa section at that point,
                    and I simply issued a decree, “No more Spanish names are going into the AVLOS
                    system. They're all going to be looked up manually in the old visa lookout book,
                    because we cannot afford to have the system run for thirty or forty-five minutes
                    printing irrelevant names every time we enter one in.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was nothing in the law, nothing in the regulations,
                        nor instructions that gave you that authority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Well, we still had the lookout books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Common sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: But what that reflects, I think, is the limits of technology and the
                    necessity to refine the technology and for human beings to make thoughtful
                    decisions about how you're going to use the technology, because when you're
                    doing a name search like that and you're using as your basic elements the name,
                    the date, and the place of birth, you have to make certain decisions about the
                    scope of the electronic search or the computer search that's going to be made.
                    There's always a tradeoff between overloading that system with a very broadly
                    defined search and thereby making it almost impossible to use the system, and
                    making it so narrow that you're going to miss an entry that you really need to
                    get. Those kinds of things cannot be solved by the technology; they can only be
                    solved by people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those words are words I heard from you many years later in
                        the Visa Office, in a very responsible position, in which you said,
                        “Officers in the field are commissioned. They are commissioned to act as
                        sensible human officers, not as bureaucrats, but people with brains and
                        common sense.” You certainly learned that in Montreal. You carried it back
                        to Washington. Can we bring you back now to Washington, where some of those
                        practical experiences perhaps came from the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. My tour in Montreal was great fun both professionally and
                    personally.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Actually, it worked quite well. We were ultimately given additional
                    personnel. We managed to reconfigure the workspace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they weren't all Gomezes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: They weren't all Gomezes. The volume increased substantially. It never
                    increased quite as much as we had projected, based on some statistical analysis
                    with numbers that came from the World's Fair organizing committee and those
                    sorts of people, but I'd say it pretty close to tripled. We had anticipated more
                    than that, but it pretty close to tripled. Thanks to the fact that we did have
                    the AVLOS system and we did get extra personnel and did get some money to
                    reconstruct the section so that we could get a better workflow, we were able to
                    deal with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a lot of good common sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Although I have to say it was very amusing. We were a ground floor tenant
                    in the Montreal stock exchange building, and, needless to say, our clientele was
                    not exactly at the same socioeconomic level as the people that normally
                    frequented the stock exchange building. One of my comic memories is this
                    building manager in his uniform pacing back and forth through the lobby at about
                    ten minutes to two, anxiously waiting for us to open for the afternoon so that
                    this motley mob that was all out in his lobby could be taken in behind our
                    curtained windows and hidden from the lawyers and the stockbrokers and other
                    elegant people that were going through the rest of the building. But we managed
                    to make it work, and it was fun and it was a very interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And those experiences from Nice and Montreal you brought
                        back to the “real world.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: [Laughter] Well . . .</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned to the Visa Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, I was assigned back to the Visa Office in early 1968. Initially I
                    was supposed to go into the anti-fraud branch, which was then under the Advisory
                    Opinions Division under good old John T. McGill, who all the old-timers will
                    remember, who was a great character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Define “Advisory Opinions”.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Under the law, the consular officer's decision on the issuance or refusal
                    of a visa is final. It's not reviewable, it's not subject to review either
                    administratively by the secretary or anybody in the department or by the
                    courts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the ambassador can't tell the guy what to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: As a matter of law, no. As an operational reality, it happens, because
                    people's careers sometimes can be at stake. But as a matter of law, the answer
                    is no. One of the functions that the Visa Office performs is to give advice and
                    guidance to consular officers on interpretations of law, and we write
                    regulations. The Visa Office establishes the procedures, the forms to be used,
                    but it also has the function of providing interpretations of law for the use of
                    consular officers in making their decisions. An attempt is made to furnish as
                    much general instruction in your standing instruction manuals as you can, but
                    you can obviously never anticipate every case, every fact pattern that a
                    consular officer is going to encounter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So many of the officers on the line are new, first tour,
                        second tour, maybe not well supervised.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Right. The big problem is you can never anticipate every fact pattern, so
                    you can't write a standing instruction manual that covers every conceivable
                    situation that an officer might encounter. So there is a procedure under which,
                    if the officer encounters a situation that puzzles him, he's not clear on how
                    the law applies to these facts, what answer the law requires on the particular
                    facts, he can seek the department's opinion on the subject. It's referred to as
                    an opinion, as opposed to an instruction, because it is not legally binding on
                    him. It remains the officer's sole legal responsibility to actually determine
                    the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Visa Office can't say, “You're wrong”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SCULLY: We can say, “You're wrong,” as a matter of law, but on the facts it
                    remains the consular officer's final decision. The instructions on individual
                    cases of this kind are referred to as opinions, but they are essentially
                    guidance. “Given the facts that have been presented by the consular officer
                    about the particular applicant, this is the way the law comes out.”</p>
                <p>In any event, initially I was destined there, but by the time I got back to
                    Washington, I had been transferred to what was then known as the Security
                    Division, which handled all the communist, espionage, and sabotage cases,
                    possible ineligibility, questions about waivers. It dealt with vetting cases
                    through the intelligence community to find out what intelligence information
                    might exist about applicants, and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>So I worked there from early 1968 up until the summer. It was an interesting
                    experience. It gave me some good insights into what the dynamics of it are, how
                    our relationships were with the intelligence community, what the perspectives
                    were of people who dealt with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were not “advisory opinions” you'd give out, then?
                        These were instructions to the post, “No, you may not issue a visa”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, they were still couched in terms of opinions. Let us say you had a
                    Russian scientist who's applying. The embassy in Moscow would be under
                    instructions to refer that case back to Washington so that the applicant's name
                    could be checked through the intelligence community to see if there was any
                    intelligence information about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All Soviet citizens had to be checked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Basically all Soviet citizens, all East European citizens, and there are,
                    and always have been, other selected cases depending on situational things. In
                    those days, this was SOP for Soviets, East Europeans. Of course, we didn't have
                    people coming from the People's Republic of China in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before terrorism had gained an equal footing, if
                        you will.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: This was before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No PLO and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SCULLY: No, there was no PLO. The Irish Republican Army was not a big issue. You
                    didn't have the Western European terrorist groups—the Red Army Fraction, none of
                    these. These were just not issues. The issue in those days was espionage. If the
                    result of these name checks with the intelligence community came back with
                    derogatory information, let us say, identifying this particular Soviet as a KGB
                    officer, that was a sufficient basis for denying him entry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you would let the post know this person was
                        ineligible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That's right. Essentially it would be framed, “It is the department's
                    opinion that Soviet scientist X is excludable because he's been reliably
                    identified as a KGB.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What if we wanted him in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That issue only became an issue later. That was really not that much of
                    an issue, because the issue of wanting to let people in, even though they had
                    been identified as intelligence operatives, really didn't become a big policy
                    issue until d�tente. So this would have been really basically several years
                    later into the early 1970s, the Nixon administration and particularly the Ford
                    administration. But in 1968, that was really not an issue. “If he's identified
                    as a KGB or the Bulgarian or Polish equivalent, we're not going to let him in.
                    It's just not an issue. Goodbye.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A party member?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: By and large, party members were granted waivers with certain very
                    limited exceptions. It was generally policy that we were not going to grant
                    waivers to permit entry for party leaders from non-communist countries, for
                    example, the French Communist Party, the Swedish Communist Party, the Argentine
                    Communist Party. Senior functionaries of those parties typically were never
                    granted admission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, as well as subsequent days, that gave us
                        most of our heartburn. Shades of gray, shades of political gray.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Also, to a certain extent the waiver was used for what I would call
                    useful purposes. By this time there had been, dating back, I think, to the
                    Kennedy administration, the beginnings of some of these various scientific and
                    cultural and educational exchanges with the Soviets and other East European
                    countries. One of the things they experienced there was that there was a
                    terrific imbalance in that far more Soviets and Poles and Bulgarians and
                    Hungarians were coming this way than were ever being allowed to go there. So,
                    for every 100 Soviet/East European academics that came here, you might get three
                    that managed to get permission to go there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there pressures on us to stabilize this
                        inequity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, there were pressures, and I think there were pressures internally
                    within the government, but there were also, to a certain extent, outside
                    pressures to see to it that there was more balance. “Why aren't the Soviets and
                    the Poles and the Hungarians and the Czechs letting American academics and
                    scientists go there as researchers and scholars?” But, you see, what you could
                    do at that point, you could use the waiver authority as kind of a club, and you
                    could go to the Soviets and say, “Now, look. There have been thirty Soviet
                    academics who have come to the United States since the last time you let one of
                    ours go there. We're not going to let this one come in unless we see some
                    American academic going over there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I'm hearing that the visa function here is not black
                        and white. A person is not admissible or inadmissible. He is a direct
                        function of the political realities of how an administration, or an element
                        within the administration, wishes to use the visa function.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: You've got to be fairly careful there, Bill, because what we're
                    discussing here is a case in which, under the law as it stood, the applicant
                    you're talking about was inadmissible by reason of his affiliation, memberships,
                    whatever. But the law went on to say that even though he's inadmissible, he can
                    be granted temporary entry in the discretion of the secretary of State and the
                    Attorney General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Read that, “In our national interests”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That was the issue about how do you use that discretion. This is where
                    you sort of get into the policy/legal angle. Discretion is a very broad term,
                    and by and large, the courts have said, not so much in this field, but where you
                    have discretionary authority generally, the courts will not disturb a decision
                    about how to exercise discretion unless they are convinced that the bureaucrat
                    or the functionary who made that decision abused the discretion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this is always in the name of the Secretary of State,
                        isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Right. It's been delegated from the secretary to the assistant secretary
                    and on to the Visa Office. There's a direct line of delegation authority. The
                    law says the Secretary of State, but there are delegations of authority that
                    delegate that to the assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that delegated person better well know what he's doing
                        and know the Secretary's with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. The assistant secretary is the secretary's subordinate. All I'm
                    saying is that the case doesn't have to be personally looked at by the secretary
                    of State. It can be dealt with under a delegation of authority, but obviously
                    the person who has that authority is going to have to exercise it in a manner
                    consistent...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And knows the secretary's policy direction.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly.</p>

                <p>SCULLY: No. You're quite right. What you do, of course, is coordinate with the
                    political officers who are in the regional bureau that's concerned. You're not
                    making these decisions in a vacuum. Particularly on this use that I was
                    describing on the academic exchanges, that decision was not one, or would not
                    have been one that would have been made solely within the consular bureau; it
                    would have been made between the European bureau, the Soviet desk, more
                    specifically, and the consular bureau in terms of, “All right, we've now got an
                    application from this Soviet academic. Do you all have any objection? Is there
                    any reason why we shouldn't recommend a waiver?” The Soviet desk would come up
                    and say, “Well, we've concluded that it's time to send the Soviets a message.
                    They haven't been letting American academics in, and we think what we need to do
                    is ring their bell a little bit, make sure that they know that we're aware that
                    they're playing these games and they're getting a lot more benefit out of this
                    than our people are.” So we think maybe it's time. We're going to tell the
                    Soviets, “This academic is not coming. We're not going to let him come in.”
                    Maybe they might even have a particular individual American in mind, a professor
                    from a university who had been attempting to go there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The McGovern Amendment was the direct result of a very fascinating thing
                    that occurred in the late Ford administration. You will recall that at that time
                    Henry Kissinger was both Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. At
                    that time, there was a man named John Volpe, who was ambassador to Italy. Mr.
                    Volpe was a relatively powerful political figure, I think from Connecticut or
                    Massachusetts. He had been a governor, and I think he had been a member of
                    Congress, and he was quite a powerful political figure. He was the ambassador to
                    Rome.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>There was an election in Italy. In fact, there had been several elections in
                    Italy. This was a period of particular instability in the Italian government,
                    and they'd had a couple of elections in a two- or three-year period. Each time
                    the Communist Party percentage of the vote crept a little closer to the
                    Christian Democratic percentage. It was still below the Christian Democrats, but
                    the gap was narrowing, and there was much speculation in those days as to
                    whether either the Christian Democrats would eventually have to bring the
                    communists into the government, into a coalition, or whether, wonder of wonders,
                    the communists might become the plurality party, and what would happen. There
                    was much concern over this.</p>
                <p>Moreover, there was much interest in this in the United States, public interest,
                    academic interest. So various academic institutions began inviting functionaries
                    of the Italian Communist Party to come and speak in the United States on
                    Eurocommunism, etc. There was much anguish within the State Department over what
                    to do about these folks.</p>
                <p>Governor Volpe, who was the ambassador in Rome, expressed the view that these
                    people really should be granted admission, that denying them admission would
                    make a public issue of it, would make them look like martyrs, would enhance them
                    in the eyes of the electorate, and would probably result in their getting even
                    more votes in the next election, and that taking it all in all, they ought to be
                    admitted.</p>
                <p>Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Sonnenfeldt didn't agree with that perspective at all.
                    Sonnenfeldt was Counselor of the Department. Their perspective was that if we
                    granted admission to these people, let them come and speak and be feted at these
                    academic things, it would convey an impression to the Italian voting public that
                    we somehow approved of the Communist Party and letting them in would, in fact,
                    produce the results that Volpe felt would be produced by keeping them out.</p>
                <p>This resulted in what I can only characterize, I think, as one of those struggles
                    of the Titans, while we mere mortals down in the office sat and waited for which
                    Titan was going to win. I don't remember all the particulars, but I remember
                    being bemused by a series of cables flying back and forth with thunderbolts and
                    invectives and invocations and things in them. But Kissinger, indeed, was
                    secretary of State and Volpe wasn't, so ultimately Kissinger prevailed.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, much time passed while this struggle played itself out. The
                    academics who'd invited these people started becoming restive and writing
                    letters and making phone calls and asking members of Congress. The press became
                    involved in it, and it all became a great embarrassment, especially when the
                    objects of all of this were interviewed in Italy and were mildly saying, “Well,
                    I'm quite happy to go at any moment the United States is willing to let me, but
                    I guess I'm just too dangerous a person.”</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>So the net result of this was that Senator McGovern decided that we simply had to
                    depoliticize this, that this was an intolerable state of affairs, so he
                    introduced, as an amendment to one of our authorization bills, a provision which
                    said that whenever you have a visa applicant whose only ground of
                    inadmissibility is his membership in, or affiliation with, a proscribed
                    organization, which was our sort of in-house jargon for communist and terrorist
                    and other kinds of organizations...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Versus a member of the KGB or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, no. We're talking about mere membership or affiliation, and no other
                    derogatory evidence. The Secretary of State should, within thirty days,
                    recommend the admission of that individual or certify to the Congress that the
                    individual's admission would be prejudicial to our security interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This might be the first time we've identified the fact
                        that the Secretary of State is responsible for recommending to the Attorney
                        General. So the Secretary can't say yes or no for an inadmissible person; he
                        has to recommend it to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General can
                        say no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That's correct, but you have to understand that historically when the
                    Secretary made a recommendation, the Attorney General had rarely, rarely, rarely
                    ever refused to concur. There is no doubt but that legally he has the authority
                    and only he has the final authority, but over many, many years, the number of
                    cases in which the Attorney General denied a recommendation, you could
                    practically count on the fingers of probably both hands, probably more than one
                    hand, but probably not more than two hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if he did, he knew that the President was with him or
                        he had power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. It was not an unknown thing, but it was very infrequent. So the
                    reality was that in 99 percent of the cases, once the secretary or the
                    department as an institution made the recommendation, then it went through, and
                    the alien got the visa and came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the McGovern Amendment, it said that the Secretary
                        had to respond within thirty days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Again, I don't want to get too technical on it, but the Congress, in its
                    infinite wisdom, used the word “should,” as opposed to “shall.” If it had said
                    “shall,” as a matter of law that would have been absolutely crystal clear,
                    mandatory. The problem that we encountered, and I was much involved in it at
                    that point, because by that time I had gotten to the point where I was
                    relatively more senior...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned in the first place to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I was in the Security Division, handling the security cases. I was only
                    there for about six months. Then I moved over, after a brief detail back to the
                    front office for the summer to cover a staffing gap, I came back in the fall
                    from that and went into the Regulations Division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you spent the next twenty years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Where I spent the next twenty years. Right about that point, I started
                    going to law school at night, and over the next four years I earned my law
                    degree at night while I was working there. That was in September '68, the
                    beginning of that school year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And decided to leave the Foreign Service and work for the
                        [U.S.] Civil Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: In fact, I was approached on that. The chief of that division was a
                    wonderful woman named Hallie Mae Pryor, who had been in the Visa Office for
                    many, many years. She'd started out as a secretary and had gone to law school at
                    night herself. By the time I came, she was a GS-15, as division chief, a really
                    fine woman, a wonderful boss. She wanted to retire, so I was approached. “Hallie
                    Mae wants to retire and clearly will in the very near future. We are looking for
                    a new division chief.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other people in that division, lawyers, civil
                        service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Not in the Regulations Division. The people below Hallie Mae were all
                    Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they wanted continuity.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SCULLY: They were looking for continuity, and it was said, “We think you're a
                    likely candidate for it. You are going to law school and you've made a good
                    record so far. But we want continuity in that position and you'd have to leave
                    the Foreign Service and became a civil servant.” Well, that coincided with my
                    own personal feelings. Again, this was personal, not professional. But for
                    personal reasons, I was thinking about doing that anyway, so it was a perfect
                    match and I said, “It's done. I'm your man. I'm ready to convert.” In 1970, I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So from 1970 until 1992, you've been a GS in what was then
                        the legislation and regulations. Your present position is what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I moved up. I'm an office director. I was in the division from '68 to
                    '73. In '73 I became chief of the division, and I was chief of the division
                    until '79, when under the administrative reorganization they created this office
                    director slot, which I then moved up to, and that's where I've been since
                    '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, the definition of what you were doing for most
                        of that time involved congressional legal relationships and writing of the
                        regulations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, legal and technical, involved with the policy, dealing with the
                    Congress on policy issues because of my background in the legal and technical
                    side of it. The things have to coordinate. Of course, I'd had field experience,
                    so I had very broad experience. I'd been down in the trenches and I'd done this
                    and that, and there just weren't that many people around who had that variety of
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're now a lawyer who didn't talk like a lawyer. Now
                        bring the McGovern Amendment into what was then to be your present job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: When I moved over to the Regulations Division in the fall of '68, I
                    really pretty much left behind me the security side of things, except that there
                    were some things that needed writing to be incorporated into the manual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found yourself with a clear-cut new set of challenges.
                        A lot of those new challenges were not only just trying to figure out how
                        the job should be done, but also what kind of bosses you had. Put very
                        bluntly, the leadership. You had Abba Schwartz as a leader when you were a
                        junior officer. You learned a lot of things from him. Now you found yourself
                        as a Civil Service employee charged with some pretty heady stuff at a period
                        when maybe things were getting really very litigious and not only political,
                        as some of the things you have already cited, but also very legal. Tell us,
                        from a leadership standpoint, some of your impressions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SCULLY: When I came back in '68, the director of the Visa Office in those days
                    was a man named George Owen, and the Assistant Secretary was Barbara Watson.
                    Each in his or her own way was an outstanding leader, people who were unique,
                    and working for whom was one of those experiences that stays with you all of
                    your life.</p>
                <p>I want to talk about George first, because George Owen is a very little-known
                    man. He's almost forgotten, I think, by most people, and I think he was greatly
                    misunderstood when he was alive. He was a strange man, he was shy, in many ways
                    withdrawn, but in his way he was a great man. He was a lawyer, but he wasn't
                    merely a lawyer; he was a scholar of the law. He was a widely read man, a widely
                    learned man, and he was a man who was deeply in some profound elemental way
                    committed to the notion that the visa function was a matter of law, that it was
                    involved with rules of law, that there were limits to what you could properly
                    do, and that those limits were legal limits, and that we were bound, even though
                    the courts won't review our decisions, the decisions of a consular officer, that
                    we were bound to abide by the rule of law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like he was a man of ethics as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He was a man of the highest, almost superhumanly rigid ethical standards.
                    I think he was one of the most completely ethical men I have ever encountered
                    anywhere in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And yet knew the political realities of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He understood political realities. He didn't particularly like them, but
                    he did understand them. He had, for example, very, very strong ideas about
                    dealing with the Congress. He understood that you had to deal with the Congress.
                    He understood the way the political game was played with the committee staffs
                    and that sort of thing. He could not, however, bring himself to play it
                    directly, so basically he had B.J. Harper play it for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She had various positions. When I first came back from Montreal, she was
                    the deputy chief of the Regulations Division. The following year, she became
                    chief of the Field Operations Division, and either the year or two years
                    following that, she became one of the deputy directors of the Visa Office. She
                    subsequently spent a year as a deputy assistant secretary for Barbara Watson
                    before going to the Senior Seminar and going to Montreal as consul general,
                    where I believe she was your direct predecessor.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike Rives in between.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She ultimately came back to Washington and once again was deputy
                    assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she really knew the Visa Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She really knew the Visa Office, she really knew Capitol Hill, she really
                    knew the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was the outside man, then, for Owen. Did Owen not have
                        relations with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, he would talk to them. It wasn't that there was not a relation, but
                    George had very rigid ideas about how you did that. He was very formalistic
                    about it. He just could not bring himself to get too close.</p>

                        close and understood Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Barbara was a unique person. That's the only way to describe her. She was
                    a black woman lawyer from New York. Her family was West Indian, I believe
                    Jamaican in origin. Her father was, I think, the first black federal judge in
                    the history of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Customs judge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Her brother also was a federal judge. Her mother, I am told, was a very
                    powerful political figure in Harlem back in the old days. We're talking now the
                    period of World War I into the 1920s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Social leader of Harlem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Social and political leader in Harlem. Barbara was politically connected
                    with the Democratic Party, very strongly so, with John Rooney, whom we've
                    mentioned earlier. But she was also politically connected with Senator [Jacob]
                    Javits of New York, even though he was a Republican. She knew everyone in the
                    black community and black establishment in this country. She moved easily in
                    every circle of society.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was a lawyer by training, and she had a brilliant legal mind and an
                    incredible memory. She had the most sensitive political antennae of anybody I
                    have ever encountered. She was absolutely a genius at the politics of a
                    situation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She used to say, “I'll go down there to that hearing, and I'll bat my
                    baby blue eyes at 'em.” We used to go down to those committee hearings of the
                    Immigration Subcommittee, and she would walk into that room, and the first
                    fifteen minutes would be spent with all of the members becoming revoltingly
                    gushing about what a pleasure it was to have her appear and what an honor it was
                    for Miss Watson to appear before them. I mean, it almost made you ill, the way
                    they gushed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did everything except describe her enormous physical
                        presence. She was a very large woman who dressed like wise, large women do,
                        impeccably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The only thing I can compare her to, and I have compared her to this and
                    it's the mental image, if you've ever seen a great ocean liner, the Queen Mary
                    or one of its equivalents, a fully dressed ship, lighted, entering a harbor—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With ultrasuede.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Barbara Watson's entry into a room was the equivalent of a great majestic
                    ocean liner like the Queen Mary with all flags flying and brilliantly lighted,
                    entering a room. She had that effect on a roomful of people. People stopped and
                    turned and looked when Barbara Watson went into a room. Her mere presence
                    commanded attention.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leadership is George Owen and Barbara Watson. Together
                        they danced beautifully.</hi>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SCULLY: They really got along quite well. Barbara, I think, understood George
                    probably better than George ever understood Barbara. I think Barbara understood
                    that George was very useful and valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She knew her background would not be understood by

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: But at the same time, one of the things that was so incredibly impressive
                    about her was that she had the self-confidence to know when to rely on people
                    and how to rely on people. Since she commanded the spotlight merely by her
                    existence, she didn't have to insist upon it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People respected her. I know of no one who did not respect
                        her. They might not have agreed or might not have liked some of her methods,
                        but everybody respected her, and she was a leader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Sheer force of her being, her personality, and intellect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take that leadership from those two people,
                        principally, and see how it affects you in what you were doing over the next

                        change some of these things under that leadership, or certainly under
                        Barbara Watson's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I have to say that I was fortunate to the point of being blessed in being
                    able to work for these people, because they gave me opportunities to do things,
                    to learn things, to be involved in things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us some examples.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Immigration legislation. The 1952 act had been substantially amended in
                    1965, major amendments. One of my regrets is that I was overseas when that
                    occurred and I was not directly involved. Abba Schwartz was crucially important
                    to that change. Without him, I don't think it would have occurred. I am sad, now
                    looking back on it, that I left and went overseas at what was a very crucial
                    moment, because the process had started in 1963 and got going into 1964, and
                    culminated in 1965, but in the middle of 1964 I left, so I was not a participant
                    in the crucial time period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still, the act of '65 certainly was more liberal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Very much more liberal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More understanding, more human.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: It abolished the old quota system, it substituted what is basically
                    today's system, although it's been modified since then, but the basic conceptual
                    structure of the system originated in 1965, even though it's been modified and
                    tinkered with in a variety of ways.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Whatever. But by 1969, it began to become apparent that there were still
                    things that needed to be done. For example, one of the things that was clearly
                    defective about the 1965 act was its treatment of immigration from the western
                    hemisphere. They did not provide a preference system under the western
                    hemisphere limit. They didn't have the orderly structure under that limit that
                    had been established for the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this really racist, or whatever word you want to
                        use?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, I think it was just one of those cases where things hadn't been
                    thought through 100 percent. They'd been thought through 90 percent, but not 100
                    percent.</p>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SCULLY: They decided that there had to be a numerical limitation on Latin
                    America, but people didn't really think through that once you set up an overall
                    limit, you need to have some way of apportioning that limit among different
                    kinds of people in terms of relatives and workers. Once you set a limit, you
                    really have to decide how you're going to apportion it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We lumped them all together as Latinos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. I think that was just a failure of forethought. It was one of
                    those things where the thought process stopped 90 percent of the way and didn't
                    really get that last 10 percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that what got us into the SILVA operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: In part. That's another whole story. Beginning in 1969, the
                    administration—and I think really this originated with Barbara—started proposing
                    further amendments to the law. All of that had to be drafted and coordinated
                    with the Departments of Labor and Justice. You don't just go out and do those
                    things; these things have to be the subject of interagency agreement, they have
                    to be vetted through the Office of Management and Budget, and a great deal of
                    work went into that. Q: The Labor Department's involvement is because of
                    certification.</p>
                <p>SCULLY: Because of certification of the need for prospective workers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had become more and more an issue under the '65
                        act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. It had become an affirmative requirement for the admission of
                    immigrant workers in the '65 act, and it had really been only marginally
                    important prior to '65, but it became a key element when it became an
                    affirmative requirement in '65 on the immigrant workers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found yourself working with Barbara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: With Barbara and B.J. Harper and George Owen, to draft the proposed
                    legislation, to sit down, participate in the discussions, the interagency
                    meetings on working it out, getting everybody coordinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Worked with congressional committees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, very much. That's when I first began to become involved with the
                    respective judiciary committees, largely in those days the House Judiciary
                    Committee. The Senate tended to be inactive because the chairman of the
                    Judiciary Committee in those days, Senator Jim Eastman of Mississippi, didn't
                    believe much in immigration legislation. But it was during that period, and
                    because of Barbara and George and B.J. that I was brought into those things. I
                    was assigned to participate. I was tasked to do things, sent off to go and meet
                    with people, participate in meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this guidance coming from the White House, or was this
                        pretty much at the Barbara Watson level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: This was pretty much being driven by Barbara. Obviously it had to be
                    vetted higher than that, because she wasn't god, she wasn't the president, she
                    wasn't the Secretary of State, but in terms of her influence, she was really the
                    one who ran with it. Most people weren't terribly interested in it. Secretaries
                    of State are typically only marginally interested in immigration issues, whether
                    their policy or individual cases. The White House only spasmodically gets
                    involved in things like that. President Johnson was, but that led up to the '65
                    act. By then we had a different administration, and they simply weren't that
                    interested in these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara was a Democrat, and she came in under Lyndon
                        Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was a Johnson appointee, but stayed on. Nixon kept her on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was there until '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six years into this administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: President Ford was president by the time she left. Nixon had done his
                    first term, started his second, resigned because of Watergate, then was replaced
                    by Ford before Barbara left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that's probably the best example of her survival in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Her political connections and her ability to survive were absolutely
                    astounding. They were just incredible.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She gave you the direction, the leadership, the
                        encouragement, and probably a few arguments in drafting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was one of the hardest working people and one of the most systematic
                    people I've ever seen. In those days, all of the subcommittees, say of
                    Judiciary, or I guess it's true of any committee, each subcommittee had a day of
                    the week which it was assigned for its normal hearing day. I think this is
                    because of other commitments. In those days, the Immigration Subcommittee's
                    normal day was Tuesday. So a hearing would be scheduled for a certain Tuesday,
                    let's say, a month or a month and a half ahead.</p>
                <p>Barbara had a very systematic way of doing business. It was standing operating
                    procedure that by the close of business on the preceding Friday, there would be
                    delivered to her a book in which was her principal witness statement, followed
                    by probable questions and recommended answers, followed by copies of any
                    pertinent documents, bills or other reports, anything. This made up her briefing
                    book. It had to be delivered to her by COB the preceding Friday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She took it home over the weekend.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She took it home over the weekend and she studied that damn thing back to
                    front. Then typically somewhere around noontime or slightly after noon on
                    Monday, you'd get a call, “Please report to Miss Watson's office,” and so we'd
                    all troop over there, B.J. and Hallie Mae, when she was still around, and then
                    after Hallie Mae left, B.J., and sometimes George, but mostly B.J. and I and
                    maybe Frank Baker, who ran the Numerical Control Division of the Visa Office,
                    plus Gene Krizek, who was the congressional relations officer, who handled our
                    bureau's affairs.</p>
                <p>We'd go into Barbara's office, and we would spend the rest of the day going over
                    that briefing book. She'd read through the statements, she'd stop and say,
                    “What's your rationale for saying this?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could she be mean? Could she pick at you harshly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, no, no. This was always extremely professional; it was right on the
                    point. It was right down to the substance. “Why do we want to say this?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In some cases, it might be just a mutual disagreement, but
                        she would make the decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SCULLY: It wasn't always necessarily that. Some of it was simply exploratory.
                    “What caused you to recommend that I make that answer? What was your thought
                    process? How did you arrive at that being the right answer?” Sometimes she would
                    disagree, but sometimes it was just purely an intellectual process of, “Okay,
                    what got you to that point? What's your analysis that leads you to come out with
                    that answer to that question?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And never did you feel, as a subordinate, that you dared
                        not disagree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Hell, no. Absolutely not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You felt you should argue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: If there was a point to be argued, you argued it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like we have a real leader there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was astounding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us an example of particular legislation that
                        maybe become very important or one that the reader would be particularly
                        interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The one piece of legislation that was key really was this question of
                    what to do about the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was from the Western Hemisphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That actually was not enacted until after she had left. It was enacted in
                    '76, but we testified on it repeatedly. She laid the groundwork. The reason it
                    wasn't enacted while she was there was basically Jim Eastman. The House enacted
                    versions of that a couple of times, and Eastman just wasn't having any of it. I
                    don't think that he necessarily agreed or disagreed with the legislation; he
                    simply didn't want the subject of immigration to come up. He was afraid that if
                    he let anything move, he'd lose control of it somehow, and things would happen
                    that he wouldn't want. So his answer was just to stifle it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He eventually retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SCULLY: He finally retired in 1978. Barbara Watson's influence on that, in terms
                    of getting the record out there and being down there on the Hill, was
                    indispensable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take that leadership and translate it back to your
                        overseas experiences. How did you view her leadership of the field? How did
                        you see the way she passed on guidance, direction, inspiration to the vice
                        consul or to the consuls general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I traveled with her. I went on several consular conferences with her.
                    Again, she was a presence. She was just a commanding presence. People responded
                    to her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Morale in those days, then, must have been good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think morale was good. I'll tell you a story about Barbara. One of my
                    first encounters with her was way back in '68. I said that I was over there on a
                    temporary duty. I was sent over there on detail for a few months. I'll never
                    forget this. I walked into her office, and she was on the phone, screaming and
                    shouting, “How dare you interfere in this matter? This is a visa case. It's my
                    responsibility. Goddamn it!” You know who she was talking to? Chip Bohlen, who
                    was the Under Secretary for Political Affairs and a legendary Foreign Service
                    officer. She was reading him the riot act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she knew she could do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She knew she could get away with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She knew she was right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Oh, she was right. Oh, indeed. This was a very sensitive visa case
                    involving intelligence implications, and she had been vastly embarrassed by
                    being bypassed on this thing, because somebody in the intelligence community had
                    gone right around her to Bohlen, and she blew her stack. Everybody knew that, by
                    god, Barbara Watson was in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the best sense of the word.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: In the best sense of the word. She worked and did more, I think, to
                    enhance, to raise, to dignify the consular service and consular work as a career
                    than anybody in modern times.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a time when we were moving from a lot of green
                        eyeshades, a clerical approach, a very defensive attitude towards a
                        full-blown, equal Foreign Service participation. She went through that
                        period, a very difficult period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: A very difficult period, but with great assurance. She had contacts. When
                    Barbara Watson spoke, people listened, because she was Barbara
                    Watson—period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We could bring ourselves up to date. Let's leave it to you
                        to say whatever you want on the subject of leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Barbara came back in '77, after a two-year hiatus, and she was there till
                    1980. She went off to be ambassador to Malaysia, and then the administration
                    changed, so her tenure as ambassador to Malaysia was truncated and she went into
                    private life. She was replaced by Diego Asencio, a career Foreign Service
                    officer and, in fact, the first career Foreign Service officer ever to hold the
                    job of Assistant Secretary. Every one of Diego's predecessors, including
                    Barbara, going all the way back to Scott McLeod in 1953, had been a political
                    appointee. So Diego was the first career officer that ever had that job. I think
                    it can be said of Diego that he did nothing to diminish what Barbara Watson left
                    him. I don't think it can be said that he did anything to increase it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A hard act to follow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: But I think, however, it can be said that Diego did not dissipate the
                    heritage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would say, then, that the office surrounding him and
                        in the field sensed leadership continued?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, I think so, but, again, what I'm essentially saying is Barbara had
                    power. Diego preserved the illusion of power without actually having it. He was
                    able to preserve the illusion that it was still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, he couldn't possibly have had the connections,
                        the history, the real elements of power. He had certain elements.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Therefore, illusion was important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. You see, he succeeded in preserving the illusion of power, and
                    he did that well. I think the man is entitled some credit for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't there but for three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He was there three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking to your position, he didn't make your work
                        difficult? He didn't argue with you in areas in which you were an
                        expert?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He would from time to time. Yes, he did from time to time. It was always
                    in good spirit, you understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You usually won?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: He would finally give it up, but to a certain extent, I got the
                    impression that he was doing it more for the sake of doing it and showing that
                    he was the Assistant Secretary and I wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, a hard act to follow. He had to show power to
                        people like you, particularly, who had had a good number of years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I also have to say one thing about Diego's tenure, and that is he had as
                    fine a senior deputy as it is possible to have, and that's Bob Fritts, a man
                    whom I consider to be a true pro. Bob was not a career consular officer; in
                    fact, I don't think he had ever had anything more than a nodding connection with
                    consular work in his entire Foreign Service career before he became Diego's
                    deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That position usually was filled with a non-consular
                        officer. I remember Barbara Watson telling me she wanted it that way in
                        order to have practical, political communication with the rest of the
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. She had a whole series of econ officers, administrative
                    officers. Actually, Barbara had hired Bob. He was there very briefly before
                    Barbara left.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after those three years with Diego, we have two
                        ladies that continued on, returning to the tradition of female
                        leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Let us say of females occupying the position. I think employing the word
                    “leadership” is not really warranted here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems, then, that maybe the role of the consular
                        function under Barbara Watson diminished particularly after Diego left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think it's declined since, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to define it in your terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think what I have to say really is directly almost more at Joan Clark
                    than it is at the current incumbent, Betty Tamposi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is Joan Clark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She is retired now. She was a career Foreign Service officer, started out
                    as Foreign Service secretary right at the end of the Second World War and
                    eventually became an ambassador, Director General of the Foreign Service, and
                    finally Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, which was her last job before
                    she retired. The thing that I think I would fault her for was she never
                    understood the dynamics of consular work, of immigration, not merely in terms of
                    the State Department's participation in it, but in its political dynamics in our
                    community, in our society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She certainly wasn't a lawyer by background, so she had
                        not that advantage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: She was better on that than she was on a lot of other things, because
                    when she was Director General, there had been a lot of litigation, and she
                    understood that litigation was an ominous thing and that litigation required
                    lawyers, and that if you were in litigation, you'd better listen to your
                    lawyers. That she did understand, and I give her credit for that. But what she
                    didn't understand was the policy implications and the dynamics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SCULLY: People, and people beyond the State Department, people out there, the
                    congressional dynamic of immigration, the public relations, the public dynamic
                    of it. She never understood those things, and she avoided, to the extent
                    possible, getting involved in them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was she in office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Six years. What she did then focus on was things that she could cope
                    with— mechanization, computerization, waste, fraud and mismanagement, all of
                    which are necessary things. They have to be integrated into the overall
                    operation, but they can't become the be-all and end-all. There has to be a
                    larger sense of what's going on and why it's going on and what the dynamics are
                    that are making it go on that way, and Joan Clark never had that sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her specialty was administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. So I think that Joan Clark essentially wound up propagating the
                    idea throughout the Department that the visa function really was one that
                    involved nothing more than computerization, mechanization, management,
                    administration, anti-fraud activities, and that there was nothing beyond
                    that.</p>

                    what's actually going on, either. The problem, of course, is compounded by the
                    fact that Joan Clark left her a largely dissipated inheritance, unlike Diego,
                    who passed the inheritance on to Joan Clark pretty much intact. He had not
                    increased the capital, but he hadn't dissipated it. What Joan Clark did was
                    dissipate the capital so that what she passed on to Betty Tamposi was an estate
                    that was in very powerless condition.</p>

                <p>SCULLY: My sense is that it is quite demoralized. One of the problems here is
                    Betty Tamposi sees the consular function as welfare and protection.</p>

                <p>SCULLY: I don't think that's a tenable approach. One of the things that I have
                    observed over the years is, if you don't have an Assistant Secretary who's
                    credible, you're in big trouble. When we've had assistant secretaries who were
                    credible, not only credible to us, but credible to their peers and the various
                    people they have to work with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You take that mantle along to the meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. People who think, “Okay, the boss is an idiot and I'll just go
                    do my thing,” eventually wind up finding out that you can't get your thing done
                    because everybody else thinks your boss is an idiot.</p>
                <p>SCULLY: Chronologically, Bill, I guess we're pretty much down to the present.
                    There are a couple of thoughts that I have about this that I would like to
                    express, and these are not chronological. The visa function is very arcane to
                    most people; it certainly was to me when I started. It is, however, very
                    challenging in several respects, or at least I have found it so. You are dealing
                    with people, you're making decisions that affect people's lives, and you are
                    making decisions that affect people's lives very, very directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Life and death.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Life and death. Futures turn on individual decisions in this
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the way our nation got going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: At the same time, I am a very strong believer, and I'm much affected in
                    this by George Owen, for whom I will have undying affection and respect, it is
                    also a matter of law. There are rules. I think it is very important in our
                    country, it's a very important aspect of our country, that we pride ourselves on
                    being a government of laws and not a government of men. Laws don't, and cannot,
                    absolutely mechanistically decide every case, because people can't write laws
                    with such scientific or mathematical precision that they will.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there are rules of law. There are concepts of abiding by rules
                    of law that I think are supremely important, and I think that is a very
                    important aspect of visa work also. I find it a very interesting aspect of visa
                    work in the following sense. I find a great intellectual satisfaction in taking
                    a complicated set of facts and by god, you get complicated sets of facts when
                    you get visa applicants, because they have complicated lives and complicated
                    histories.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That's true, too, but assuming you can get at what the facts are, as
                    opposed to what they appear to be, even there you get extremely complex sets of
                    facts that have to be plugged into and analyzed in terms of an extremely complex
                    law, and I find a great deal of intellectual satisfaction and stimulation in
                    working through a set of facts, applying the law, figuring out how the law
                    works, what the impact of this provision is on that provision, and coming out
                    with an answer, and having the satisfaction of saying, “I have arrived at the
                    correct answer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take that thought and translate it to Mexico City,
                        Ciudad Juarez, a junior officer with fifty very strange-looking malefactors
                        in front of you, and you've got one hour to get through all of them. Put
                        those two things together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: The problem is that's another aspect of the business, and this is where
                    it's a multifaceted business. Sure, you've got the mass phenomenon, and that is
                    the people who are applying as tourists, some of whom are bona fide tourists,
                    many of whom are not. Depending on where you are, the percentages are going to
                    vary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you weren't distinguishing between immigrants and

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, I'm not necessarily distinguishing between immigrants and
                    non-immigrants in what I'm saying, because you do get, in addition to that mass
                    phenomenon, which really is a simple process of moving people through almost on
                    a conveyor belt and saying, “You look like a good tourist to me. Fine. You get a
                    visa.” “You don't look like a good tourist. You look like an intending worker.
                    You don't get a visa.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: No, but that's only part of the operation, though. There's more to it
                    than that, and there is going to increasingly be more to it than that, because
                    you do get into radically more complicated cases where the issues are, “This
                    applicant wants to come to the United States and do this, and he (or she) has
                    that background. Is there a slot for that applicant somewhere in the system? If
                    so, which slot is it?” That can get to be very complex.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you convey this feeling, which is vital, as far as
                        I'm concerned, to those officers in the field? How can you inspire
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SCULLY: I don't know how you can inspire them. Somebody's got to do the grunt
                    work, which is basically moving all of those purported tourists through the
                    process in deciding which are really tourists and which aren't. Q: There are
                    those who say the only ones who ever reach you at that level are those who have
                    a congressman.</p>
                <p>SCULLY: Oh, no, I don't think that's true. Sure, the Visa Office as an
                    institution gets lots and lots of inquiries about tourists. “Why didn't my third
                    cousin get a visa? He only wanted to come and see me for three weeks.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or immigrants who are coming to work in a special
                        category, they don't have enough money or whatever. There could be all
                        levels of intervention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, and maybe working in the Visa Office, you do tend to see a
                    distillation of these, and therefore you can get more intellectual stimulation
                    because what you do get in the Visa Office are the cases that can't be dealt
                    with routinely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or come to you through special attention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, but I think normally, though, the cases that come to us—and I assume
                    you mean “you” in the plural sense, not personally—are typically the cases that
                    can't be dealt with routinely. If you've got a perfectly clear-cut case of an
                    American who marries a foreigner and it's a traditional marriage and they're
                    living together and they've been living together and they have children, etc.,
                    it's sort of a 1950s sitcom kind of marriage, that case never comes to the Visa
                    Office. There's no reason to. Nobody raises any issues about that case, because
                    it's perfectly clear on its face. The petition is going to be approved
                    routinely, the visa's going to be issued routinely. People are going to look at
                    it and say, “Gee, there's nothing wrong with this case. We'll just move it right
                    through.” You have to get your satisfaction out of having rendered somebody a
                    service. There your satisfaction has to come from saying, “These people are
                    entitled to this service and, by god, I did it well, I did it fast, I got them
                    in here, I got them out, and here I sent them on their way happily.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They smiled and said, “Thank you.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. There is a satisfaction in that. That's not an intellectual
                    stimulation, but it is a job satisfaction. It's a human satisfaction you get
                    from providing a service that people are entitled to on those facts, promptly
                    and in a friendly way, and there it's a human satisfaction and it's a
                    satisfaction, I think, in knowing that you have given them a favorable
                    impression of the government.</p>

                <p>SCULLY: Posts aboard get these, too. Don't think that they all come to
                    Washington, because we've got plenty of damn good officers out there with
                    excellent minds, excellent training, who handle a fair number of these
                    complicated cases and figure out, “This is the way it ought to be dealt

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Well, one hopes. I think there is that component to it. How do you show a
                    brand- new junior officer that that is and can be so? I'm not sure I know the
                    answer to that question, because there is that inescapable sort of basic grunt
                    work that's got to get done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You answered it before when we talked to the higher level,
                        and that's the leader. That junior officer damn well better have a good
                        leader. If that leader isn't there, then the junior officer has no one to
                        turn to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: But how do you allow that junior officer to understand that if he sticks
                    with this, he'll get by the grunt work and these things are out there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a lesson in itself. “Time is going to pass, and I
                        am, as a junior officer, going to have to go through some of these things.
                        If I don't have the nobility and strength of character to get through it,
                        then I shouldn't have joined the Foreign Service.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think to a certain extent it's like saying every master chef started
                    out as the number-three salad chef, tearing up lettuce and putting it in bowls.
                    That's grunt work, too. You don't start your career as a chef by cooking meals
                    at the Ritz Carlton Hotel. You have to start somewhere down at the bottom and
                    work to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People keep coming back into it. In terms of pressures,
                        you brought the pressures of Montreal. You said that nobody seemed to
                        understand what our staffing complement was or should be. We have that
                        today. You must face it in every day's work by the pressures you see that
                        are being brought more and more on them. Do you have any comments on the

                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think it's probably the most serious concern that I have, because we've
                    spent the last fourteen years being told to do more with less.</p>

                <p>SCULLY: And do it better, by the way. Within certain limits, it is possible to do
                    more with less, because there are ways that you can cut corners, there are ways
                    you can improve procedures, there are ways you can make use of automation, but
                    there are limits to that. I think we passed those limits some time ago, and that
                    is the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're on borrowed time now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, I think we may well be. The problem, as I see it, and by no means
                    peculiar to the consular service, is that we are simply experiencing something
                    that is probably true with people in government generally, not just the State
                    Department and not just the federal government, and that is, the public wants
                    more and better service for less and less money. The notion that you only get
                    what you pay for seems to have gotten lost somewhere, and it's not merely here.
                    It certainly is true here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This isn't just dissatisfaction with Washington by the guy
                        in Peoria; this is dissatisfaction with the government in general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think so, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “I want more for less.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes. “I want my schools to be better, but I'll be damned if I'm going to
                    pay a meal tax.” For the reader of this, we're talking about a recent event in
                    Fairfax County, Virginia, where the voters rejected a 2 percent tax on
                    restaurant meals which would have been devoted to the school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they thought there was waste in the government,
                        not necessarily in education, but building too many big buildings and having
                        too many perks out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SCULLY: It's reflective. Sure, people want education to be better, they want
                    better police forces, they want better police protection, they want better
                    roads, they want all of these various things, and yet when the time comes that
                    somebody says, “But better roads cost money, better policemen cost more money
                    because you have to have better educated policemen and you have to pay them more
                    and you have to have more of them and better trained policemen,” then people
                    suddenly start saying, “Wait a minute. Don't raise my taxes. Don't spend more of
                    my money on these things.”</p>
                <p>I think what we're seeing with the consular service is basically a microcosmic
                    example of that. For that reason, I'm not sure that there's any solution,
                    because the solution, to the extent there is one, doesn't have anything to do
                    with the consular service as such, or with the visa function as such; it has to
                    do with this larger issue. But I do think that if these pressures continue,
                    we're beginning to see evidence of a breakdown in professionalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The limit having been reached where the individual
                        performers, in this case the officers and the staff, just say, “No
                        more.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. They're pushed beyond their limits. You burn people out. People
                    are no longer able to deal with the public in a decent-minded manner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you sense that this voice is coming from the field
                        and/or from within the department? “Enough's enough.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I think it comes out in other ways. Yes, we've actually heard that
                    overtly in some cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Consular conferences or messages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Communications from the field saying, “You've told us that we're not
                    going to get increased staff. Therefore, we're simply not going to do this
                    anymore.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “We will issue visas on Mondays and Fridays only.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. That sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doesn't Congress play a role? They're the moneybags behind
                        all this. Can't they order more funds to be allocated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>SCULLY: They could, but will they? If you look at the way Congress has been
                    dealing with budgetary issues in the larger sense, I just don't think it will.
                    That's what really bothers me about the consular service, as I see it at this
                    point, Bill.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I shouldn't have raised it, because it's something that
                        neither of us can do absolutely anything about, other than the way we vote.
                        If we don't have the leadership that we've had and we don't have the funds,
                        and we have lost a big chunk of professionalism, or are losing it, maybe you
                        ought to join me in retirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Well, I'm thinking on that, as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, as the evening has reached the end, any other final
                        thoughts on any of these things? We could go on for a long time, and the
                        readers would love to hear you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: There are lots of things one can talk about, Bill—relations with the
                    Immigration Service, how the thing works between the two of us. I think the
                    Immigration Service is an example of what happens when things really do break
                    down, when professionalism really does break down. One of the things that I'm
                    troubled about—and again this is part of the breakdown—decision-making is hard,
                    it's a wearing thing, and you see from time to time officers in our service,
                    more so in the Immigration Service, who are looking for substitutes for
                    decision-making, magic formulae that will allow them to produce an answer
                    without making a decision, because the formula will produce the answer for them.
                    The Immigration Service is always looking for bright line tests so that
                    everything is binary. It's either black or it's white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like a computer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. There's no gray. One of the fundamental problems with visa work
                    is that most things are gray, and that requires a great deal of intestinal
                    fortitude to day after day after day after day make decisions that you can't
                    quantifiably guarantee are right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made the decision, though, because you thought you
                        were right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't guess it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SCULLY: No. You see, the problem is, you thought you were right, but you're never
                    sure. If it was all mathematical, you could simply plug the various elements,
                    the various numbers into the formula, and let the computer produce the
                    answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The problem is that we have to deal with humans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly. That's another element, and that's something that we can work
                    on, because you can try to encourage people and motivate people to understand
                    that it's gray and to accept that not only are these things gray, but the world
                    is frequently gray, and that decisions do have to be made, even though there
                    isn't any black and white that you can rely on for the decision that it's
                    gray.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to your opening comments. That's what makes the job
                        fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That's what makes the job fun, but it's also extremely taxing, it's
                    extremely stressful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Especially under pressures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Under pressures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's what you get paid for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: That's what you get paid for. Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And hopefully that's what you have fun doing. When I
                        retired, I said, “I had one fun thirty-seven years.” If you can't do that,
                        forget it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I've loved it myself, I really have. It's been intellectually
                    stimulating. It's been fun in this other sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've helped people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Yes, I feel that I have helped people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Made good friends.</hi>

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SCULLY: I've made a lot of good friends professionally and personally, but
                    through my professional contacts. I feel that I have helped people. I can think
                    of cases where the facts were just against the individual, and you couldn't help
                    them. You can't let that get you down, either. You just have to accept that
                    that's part of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of doctors and social workers and so on can't
                        help.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You do your best.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: You have to try to get the satisfaction out of doing what you can, the
                    best way you can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whenever you do retire, Dick, you can retire with the
                        satisfaction of knowing that everyone in the field looks at you as Mr. Visa
                        Office. There might be other people who have come and gone, but you are the
                        one that understood the problems, who held to the criteria that you named
                        Mr. Owen as having, somebody who understood there were people out there, but
                        that there was a law. That should be great personal satisfaction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: It is a satisfaction to me, Bill, and that is why George Owen really, in
                    many ways, is my hero. I've had many mentors, I've had many people whom I have
                    greatly respected—B.J. and Barbara, lots of people, Laurie Lawrence. We could
                    name them all day. But there is a special place in my heart for George Owen.
                    He's a man who was very special to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that got to you, you could pass it on to others,
                        and you've done it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCULLY: I've tried to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, thank you very much.</hi>
