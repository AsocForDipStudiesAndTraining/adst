                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 14th of January, 1998. This is an interview
                        with Richard M. Gibson. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy and Dick and I
                        are friends. Dick, could you tell me when and where you were born and
                        something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I was born on May 11, 1942 in Miami, Florida. At the time, my father was
                    in the Navy and he was stationed in Florida in flight training of some sort. I
                    am not sure what kind of training it was. He met my mother, who worked at a
                    hospital, and they got married. I was born and about three months later we all
                    moved to California by car. My mom and I stayed with my father's parents when my
                    father went off to the South Pacific for the war. He was a naval aviator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: From then until I grew up. Basically, I grew up in California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you grow up in California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Mainly in San Diego. Wait a minute. Boy, this is interesting. I know you
                    are going to edit this so you don't care how distorted it seems but come to
                    think of it, after the war my dad was posted or assigned to Norfolk, Virginia to
                    a naval air station. We moved back to Norfolk, Virginia. My earliest
                    recollection of life really are basically from Norfolk, Virginia where I went to
                    first and second grade. We left Norfolk, Virginia in 1950 when my dad was
                    medically discharged from the Navy. At the time he was a warrant officer and he
                    had suffered kidney damage in Guadalcanal. He died within five years of being
                    discharged in '55.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In 1950 we all hopped in the car again and we drove back to California. This time
                    I had a little sister as well. We grew up then in Southern California. We moved
                    first to Los Angeles and stayed with my dad's parents for a while. Then he got a
                    job in San Diego in the government working for a naval electronics laboratory
                    doing electronics research so we all moved down to San Diego. I grew up in San
                    Diego and graduated from high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Actually it's in San Diego County. If you go to the east county, there is
                    a town called El Cajon which is the second largest city in the county. We moved
                    out there, bought a house and that's where I grew up. I went to a high school
                    called Grossmont High School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were certainly near the border. Was there a Mexican
                        influence at all while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I can remember in junior high and in high school having Mexican American
                    buddies but we were sort of like school buddies. There didn't seem to be that
                    large of a Mexican American population at the time and the Mexican guys were
                    sort of in a pretty small minority. I think there's a lot more there today but I
                    don't remember much. There were Mexican restaurants and there were a lot of
                    Spanish language words in the vocabulary. We all learned a little bit of Spanish
                    and that sort of thing but there wasn't really a powerful influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any touch of international affairs while
                        you were in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No. The only touch of it I had was I got interested in judo and I took
                    judo for a while in high school. My instructor was a Japanese American from
                    Hawaii. Actually he was born in Japan, had immigrated to Hawaii and had then
                    come to San Diego. That was my only other, besides the slight Mexican influence,
                    foreign influence that I can recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your interests in high school other than
                        girls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Cars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're from California. When I was in the Air Force, I
                        remember, we talked about girls but the guys from California talked about
                        cars.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>GIBSON: That was the big thing, it was cars. All of my buddies, we all had old
                    clunkers and we would rotate from one guys driveway to the next fixing the car
                    on sort of a routine basis. As one would break we would fix it and then the next
                    one would break. I used to keep crashing my gear box when dragging on the
                    streets, which was illegal, of course, but we had lot of fun and we all did it.
                    It was mainly a car culture, and camping and scouting. I spent a lot of time
                    with scouting explorers and we spent a lot of time in the back country camping
                    in the desert and hiking in the high Sierras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were getting close to college time what were you
                        pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Not much really. My grades in high school were not really very
                    spectacular. I had about a C+ average. I actually could not have gotten into
                    many colleges and I was actually going to go into the Marines. Then I thought,
                    oh well, I'll try college. I got to college and sort of in a better study
                    environment, and basically became an A student and never quit. I started
                    studying for a change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: San Jose State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: From '60 and I went four-and-a-half years to get my bachelors. That would
                    have been January of '65 when I got my bachelors and I stayed around until June
                    of '66 to get my masters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in college what sort of got you going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GIBSON: What I was interested in? For one I was terrified of flunking out because
                    I had such a checkered high school career. Actually in high school I had been in
                    a gifted and talented program because I read a lot and I could read fairly well.
                    I did pretty well at first and then quickly, as soon as I got my car, life went
                    to hell. I knew I was smart enough to go to college but I just didn't have any
                    grades and I lacked self confidence, so I studied like crazy. So it was fear
                    that drove me. As I got to college I got on to the San Jose College judo team
                    from my freshman year on really, and the coach on the judo team hired me. My
                    life in college was wrapped up between studying like crazy, working 30 to 40
                    hours a week in a chain of medical laboratories as a sort of janitor, clean up
                    boy, messenger and that sort of thing, and it revolved around judo practice. We
                    had tournaments around the country and that sort of thing. In college I got very
                    close to the Japanese American community. A lot of my buddies on the judo team
                    were Japanese guys or else real Japanese guys who had come in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: San Jose was sort of the agricultural heart of California
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: It was a large orchard area with a lot of apricots, plums and that sort
                    of thing. When I first went up there in '59, I went up with a buddy who was
                    going there just to check it out, there were orchards all over the place. San
                    Jose and Santa Clara were just covered with orchards. By the time I left San
                    Jose in '66 most of the orchards were gone. I went back in '73 and they were all
                    gone. It was a rich agricultural area at one time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a good solid Japanese American
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Most of them were farmers or had been or were small business people.
                    There was a community not far from the school. The judo coach actually, we
                    rented our coach from the U.S. Olympic team two or three times, sort of took me
                    under his wing and sort of semi adopted me. He used to feed me and put up with
                    me a lot. His wife and daughters used to do the same. It was a very nice
                    relationship. Having the income because my mom was a widow working at GS-3 or
                    something like that, not making any money, and had it not been for the coach
                    providing me the job and the sort of moral support, I doubt if I would
                    have...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the coach's name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yoshihiro Uchida. He's still alive and in California. I remember in March
                    of '92 I came back from Thailand. The school had a big dinner in his honor and I
                    came all the way back from Thailand and paid $100 for the dinner. It was sort of
                    a testimonial dinner. The guy is really well known. He's a great guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being almost a drop-by guest of your judo coach, did it
                        give you any insight into the Far East at all or was this pretty much an
                        Americanized area even in San Jose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I think at the time San Jose State had the largest or the second largest
                    number of foreign students in the country, largely from Asia. I knew a lot of
                    foreign students. At one time or another I had several roommates from Japan and
                    I got a lot of exposure that way. Most of the guys were associated with Judo.
                    The coach and his family were very Americanized. They were second generation but
                    they kept some of the Japanese customs. We would go from house to house and eat
                    sushi and that sort of thing. Because of that contact I met an awful lot of
                    people from Japan. I had a very good relationship with the coach and so what he
                    would do, he would bring over graduate students from Japan who had finished
                    their college eligibility for judo. These guys were like national level
                    competitors in Japan. He would bring them over and they would spend their
                    graduate years beating up on all of us guys who were on his team. It was to make
                    us tough and to help him teach us. It was very effective. I was the duty guy who
                    was their roommate. These guys would come and they'd say coach suggested that we
                    come and ask you to take care of this guy. So they would move in with me for a
                    while and I would teach them about America and life in the States. He would
                    teach me how to cook Japanese food and then beat the dickens out of me on the
                    judo mat. It was a lot of fun. I got to know a lot of Japanese people and I got
                    a real interest in Japanese culture out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the foreign students, particularly the Japanese,
                        getting out of San Jose? Why were they coming there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: That's a good question and I honestly don't have an answer. The judo guys
                    were basically getting a scholarship from the coach to come over and he would
                    pick up their tabs. The other graduate students, some of them which I ran across
                    later in life, were Thai, there were a lot of Filipino, a lot of Chinese from
                    Hong Kong and Taiwan, a whole mix. What they were getting out of it, I really
                    don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many engineering?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think that is probably the answer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes a lot of engineers, but not all of them. In fact there was a woman
                    who was there the same time I was, who subsequently, purely by chance, ended up
                    working for me in Bangkok. It was a Thai woman who was there studying
                    international relations and just doing something like that. I don't really
                    recall what they were studying but I think largely engineers.</p>

                <p>GIBSON: Not much. I was a social science major which is what my undergraduate
                    degree is in. It is a hodgepodge of sort of whatever I wanted in the social
                    sciences: history mainly, political relations, international relations type
                    stuff. My masters is in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were going through this thing, were you pointing
                        yourself toward anything other than doing well in judo and in studying hard?
                        This is you life you understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Most people have got to think that you had this early interest in the
                    Foreign Service and all that. Nonsense. I didn't have any interest. I didn't
                    even know about it. I didn't even know the Foreign Service existed. I traveled
                    to Japan as part of the judo team. We went over and competed in Japan. In fact
                    we were the first U.S. judo team to visit Japan since the War at the time. That
                    was 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We got the dickens beat out of us, but graciously. The Japanese were very
                    gracious and took great care of us. We went under USO auspices so we had access
                    to all the military bases where we would stay for very low cost. We paid all
                    this ourselves out of our own pockets and just had a great time. Traveled all
                    around the country putting on judo exhibitions. I think I beat one guy, had one
                    draw, and something like five loses. I had one of the better records. It was
                    pretty tough competition over there and we weren't even fighting their top guys.
                    They wanted to make sure they'd beat us but they didn't waste the time of their
                    really good guys.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I didn't have an interest in the Foreign Service. I didn't even know it existed.
                    Of course by the time I was a graduate student, the Vietnam War was heating up.
                    What I began to set my sights on towards the end of my masters year-and-a-half
                    was a career as a naval officer. I tried to get into the navy before but my
                    eyesight was so bad that they wouldn't take me and they wouldn't give me a
                    waiver. As they were expanding the fleet during the Vietnam War they began to
                    give waivers and they were waiving vision for naval flight officers, the guys
                    who sit in the back seat. I have this great dream of sitting in the back seat of
                    a Phantom Four and cruising around. I signed on and they were processing me.
                    About halfway through the process, just towards the end I guess, they toughened
                    up the requirements again and they said we can't give you a waiver to fly even
                    as a crewmen. I said, “Okay, and they said, “How about being a ship driver or a
                    line officer” or whatever they call it. I said, “Okay, I'll be a ship driver.”
                    My whole family had all been career: my father, my father's father, my mom's
                    brother, a whole lot of career navy people in my family. I said this is great
                    and so I went to OCS. In college I was pointing towards a career as a naval
                    officer not as a Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your masters degree in 1966 and then did you go
                        into the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, directly to Newport, Rhode Island. I spent from the very end of June
                    until the day after or before Thanksgiving (I forget which now) at Newport,
                    Rhode Island. Then I was assigned to a destroyer home-ported in Long Beach,
                    California which was nice because that's where my wife is from. We took off back
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I got married in April of '66. My wife was teaching and I think she was
                    substitute teaching. She had gotten her credential in January of '66 as a
                    general secondary teacher. She was teaching at local schools as a substitute. We
                    had been dating since September of '63 and so we decided to get married. We got
                    married in April. At the time I was a teaching assistant in the history
                    department. In June we took off for Rhode Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Five years almost to the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So '66 to '71. You were on a destroyer. What were you
                        doing on the destroyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Surprisingly enough it is funny. Out of OCS I wanted to go to swift boats
                    and go patrol around in Vietnam's rivers and stuff, the riverine stuff. My
                    company officer said “look, you want to make a career out of this” because I
                    did. “Others that don't want to make a career of this and are just doing this
                    for a while, we'd say yes go to swift boats and have a ball. But you, you've got
                    to go to destroyers.” He talked me into going to destroyers. So then a job came
                    open and I was going to be the DASH officer. DASH stands for drill
                    anti-submarine and helicopter. It was this little helicopter that never really
                    worked well. It was a little thing. They put it in the back on a little
                    helicopter pad in the stern of a destroyer. They would fly it out controlling it
                    with a joy stick and find a submarine and either drop a nuclear weapon on it or
                    nuclear depth charge or shoot it with a torpedo. There are all kinds of funny
                    stories but the damned thing never worked right. I was all set to go to be
                    trained for that but then he said “wait a minute, what's your vision?” Back to
                    the vision thing so I couldn't qualify. Then they sent me to be a gunnery
                    officer. I went to San Diego and I learned to be a gunnery officer. Then they
                    sent me back to my ship in Long Beach and in June of '67 we went to the Gulf of
                    Tonkin, spent a couple of months there, and then came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I get the feeling that your vision wasn't good enough to
                        fly a drone but they didn't care whether you shot straight or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We shot with computers and map targets and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were in the Tonkin Gulf what was
                        your destroyer doing? What was the name of your destroyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The Henry W. Tucker which is ED875. It had been built in time to
                    participate in the Battle of Okinawa. It was old. It had been modernized. It was
                    called a FRAM-1. FRAM stood for free reconstruction and modernization or
                    something like that. It was a nice ship for its day. It is now part of the
                    Brazilian navy, the last I heard anyway. We gave it to the Brazilians for some
                    reason.</p>
                <p>We did a whole lot of things. We did an awful lot of playing guard, chasing
                    aircraft carriers around the Gulf of Tonkin in the period. We were to pick up
                    any downed pilots if they crashed coming in, this sort of thing. We never did.
                    We had one chance to pick up a downed pilot when an A-4 went off the deck of one
                    of the carriers, I forget which one. It was a cold launch. He went off and hit
                    his ejection button and he went up in the air as off the angle one on the side,
                    the A-4 went in the water. He came down and before we could get to him a
                    helicopter from the other carrier got him. We get a lot of that and we get a lot
                    of gunfire support for which we won some kind of a Navy commendation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you shooting at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Trees, buffalo, hopefully some Vietcong though I don't know. It was in
                    support of U.S. ground forces. We did a lot of what they call northern SAR,
                    northern search and rescue. They would send two of us up and we would park off
                    the mouth of Haiphong harbor. There was us (we had guns), and there was a newer
                    destroyer which had missiles and had a gun but it wasn't worth much. But it had
                    anti-aircraft missiles with it so it was nice to have around. The two of us
                    would sit out there and cruise around. We could see the entrance to Haiphong and
                    the ships going in and out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a North Vietnam harbor, the enemy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, the major seaport there. Our job was to catch shot up airplanes as
                    they'd come back over the Gulf. They would eject and then go into the water
                    there as opposed to on land. The rule of thumb seemed to be that if you got hit
                    over Hanoi or Haiphong, you'd turn and hope you made it over the water. Then you
                    got out over the water and we were there to pick them up. We did that. We picked
                    up a couple of guys and the other ship did. The other ship, the guided missile
                    destroyer had a little helicopter too. We were there to provide protection for
                    the missile ship against PT boats if the ship had a problem. They were there to
                    provide protection against aircraft for us so it worked out okay. It was a lot
                    of fun. So we did those three things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We came back right at the very end of December of '67 to the port at Long
                    Beach. The ship was not a happy ship. It was a lot of fun in a lot of ways but
                    we had a real jerk for XO, executive officer. I pretty much decided that the
                    Navy wasn't as glamorous as all that it had been cracked up to be. Many of my
                    graduate school Profs. in college had said don't go in the Navy, go get your
                    Ph.D. and become a teacher. Actually I was one of the guys who didn't have to go
                    into the Navy. My draft status was 4A, which was sole surviving son. They had a
                    category back then for that. I probably would not have been called up actually.
                    I was talking to my detailer and the guy said, “I see you've got a masters
                    degree”. In those years it was sort of something. I said, “Yes”. He said, “How
                    would you like to teach history at the Naval Academy?” It beats going to sea on
                    the big gray thing. I had to extend, I was a reservist. I extended to make it a
                    five year commitment and went back and taught at the Naval Academy for three
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were teaching there from '68 to '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes. I taught history and I taught international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to examine this a bit because naval officers
                        are sort of notorious for being interested in the Navy, period. I am just
                        reading an autobiography of Admiral Crowe who was Chief of Naval Operations.
                        He was probably the only Ph.D. to become Chief of Naval Operations. He talks
                        about the problem with the Navy of the narrowness of the naval officer and
                        not understanding that the world is a complicated place. It is not just
                        driving ships or flying airplanes, but you have to deal with other countries
                        and all. Here you are in the heart of the beast, you might say, during this
                        time. Can you talk about your experiences there with the young people coming
                        up, capturing the history and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I got there just after they first started allowing a different major at
                    the Naval Academy. Prior to that time, maybe a year or two years before I don't
                    know exactly, they had no choice, you majored in engineering. Everybody went
                    through, and you had a few electives and you had some core subjects in the
                    liberal arts, but basically everyone was an engineer. By the time that I got
                    there they were just starting to allow a limited number, and it was limited by
                    order, of people to major in history or international relations or foreign
                    languages, but in very small numbers. The feeling at the Naval Academy was that
                    definitely the liberal arts majors, as opposed to the engineering and science
                    majors, were the second class citizens among midshipmen. They were the ones that
                    didn't get much respect from the company officers and from the
                    administration.</p>
                <p>The faculty in the history, liberal arts area didn't get much respect either.
                    Most of the civilian professors in the liberal arts area were guys who had been
                    there forever and they were so narrowly focused in their own minds and
                    everything. In addition to those we had a bunch of young guys like myself and
                    many of my colleagues. We were young officers. Some of them were ensigns and
                    J.V.'s and had never even been on a ship. I was one of the more experienced guys
                    after two years on a ship. We were all constantly getting in trouble with the
                    old line civilian professors. Of course the head of the department of English,
                    history and government was a Navy four stripe or a Navy captain and the XO was a
                    Navy commander. The guys who really had the influence were these old line
                    civilian professors. Some were quite good and quite knowledgeable but they just
                    were very old school and they were so resistant to any kind of a new idea of any
                    way to teach or anything like that. I remember getting in trouble with one
                    because he kept referring to Japs in his lectures to the midshipmen. This was in
                    1970-71. My wife is a Japanese American and I went up and told him that one day.
                    I said “My wife would really be upset to hear you use the term Jap. I believe
                    the term is Japanese.” He did not like that at all. But that was the mentality
                    of these guys.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Even in the time when I was at the Naval Academy just what you were saying is
                    true. They were very much engineering oriented. The lion share of the budget,
                    the new buildings and the new facilities and everything were for the engineers
                    and the science majors. The rest of us took a back seat. That being said, when
                    it comes out to being on a ship I think that a good solid engineering background
                    is essential. If I were the skipper of the ship and had my choice of engineers
                    or liberal arts great thinkers on board, I would want the engineers. I would
                    feel a lot safer. I would feel that my power plant would run better and I would
                    feel that my computers and electronics would be doing better.</p>
                <p>I as a history major as a gunnery officer, had two kinds of guys working for me.
                    The first group were the gunners mates who are basically mechanics and kept the
                    guns working. If it needed a part they would change it. They were mechanics,
                    good old boys basically from the south. Then I had another group of guys who
                    were fire control technicians. These guys were smart. They were electronic and
                    math whizzes. They chose not to go to college for one reason or another so they
                    came in enlisted, but they were really smart guys. I could relate to the gunners
                    mates because I understood mechanics. The fire control technicians would start
                    talking to me about circuitry and computers and this sort of stuff, my eyes
                    would glaze. I didn't have a clue what they were talking about which I think
                    kept me from being as effective an officer as an engineering officer in the same
                    job would have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is the basic fact that the Navy is different from
                        really the Air Force, and especially the Army. The Army is sitting around
                        waiting to fight a big war. Even with a fighting war such as in Vietnam, the
                        rest of the people are sort of sitting around and education is one way to
                        keep them busy. You can't sort of do combat every day on the ground whereas
                        the Navy is out there driving ships all the time. The majority of their
                        people are doing that and they can't afford the luxury of this broadening
                        training. I have heard people say for example in dealing with the Army at
                        the war colleges, that the Army is more like us (we're talking about Foreign
                        Service people) but the Navy and to some extent the Air Force are not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: When I went to teach three years at the Naval Academy, all of my more
                    senior officers, my department head, my XO and my skipper, told me I was ruining
                    any chance for a career because especially at a young age to take time out from
                    not being on a ship was the kiss of death basically. It would basically preclude
                    me from having any sort of a successful Navy career. It was the same attitude
                    with like attach�s. One of department heads was a four striper, a Navy captain,
                    and came back from Chile I think. He had been an attach�. He was the first to
                    say going in the attach� rank kills you. That's guaranteed that you are never
                    going to go any further. People who they put in the attach� business are people
                    who aren't going to get promoted anyway past a certain level. The people who go
                    in the Navy to joint commands and things like that are guys who basically, not
                    guys like Admiral Crowe because he's head of the joint command...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He talks about it in the same way. He spells this out that
                        he was a very peculiar beast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes and he is a terribly, exceptionally capable man. Basically they want
                    you riding at sea and shore duty was bad for your career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the record, the reason why we are talking about
                        this is in the Foreign Service and in our foreign relations, the military is
                        an extremely important component of this and sort of the outlook an all, it
                        is interesting to examine this. What about the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Let me just say, and we can do this later at a future time but when we
                    get up to my time in Thailand and Japan I did a lot of pol-mil work and worked a
                    lot with the military guys, all three services. We can get into this then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your students? How were they responding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The students were basically a great bunch of kids and they were kids. We
                    used to have a joke that we took 18 year old boys and turned them into 22 year
                    old boys because in the Naval Academy in that four years they had such a
                    sheltered life in so many ways, that they never really grew up until they got to
                    sea and went onto ships. The Vietnam War was on and most of them were pretty
                    cynical about it as I recall. They were smart, they were nice kids, they were
                    interested in engineering. Most of them weren't that interested in the liberal
                    arts but they were taking my courses because it was required, I was teaching
                    core courses. They had an engineering bent.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I would say the majority of them, in their cases, I was appalled at the low
                    quality of their ability to write an essay test for example, misspellings,
                    grammatical errors, I was just astounded. One day I remember saying to the class
                    “What's the matter with you guys? You're all smart. I know you are all studying
                    and you're all trying. You write essay answers that have misspelling,
                    grammatical errors and everything, your structure wanders and you can't seem to
                    get a thesis or a subject sentence or whatever they are.” They said “We're
                    products of the high schools that we're coming out of.” Of course these guys did
                    have good grades, they are smart kids. I wasn't that much older than them but it
                    turned out that when I was in high school they really drilled us in grammar. I
                    had an English teacher that just took us over, really whipped up on us about
                    grammar and spelling. Three spelling errors on a paper, automatic F. One reduced
                    it a grade every test. The midshipmen were saying that in their high school
                    English classes they studied literature. They discussed books and that sort of
                    thing and they were told let your imagination, your creative juices flow. They
                    never really got hammered on grammar and spelling. Admittedly, these were
                    engineers and most of them were never going to really have to work with a lot of
                    prose and writing and that sort of thing, so they thought, but they weren't very
                    good at writing. That's what I recalled. That was my biggest criticism of the
                    kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there '68 to '71 which was really the height of
                        the protest movement outside. Did this intrude at all? You were teaching
                        political science, international studies and all as sort of the barbarians
                        were screaming outside the walls of Annapolis. Did this intrude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No they weren't. The barbarians were in Washington. They were having the
                    big protest marches on the mall and that sort of thing. They weren't in
                    Annapolis. There is a school in Annapolis, St. Johns, which is apparently a
                    wonderful little school. It's the great books and the classics thing. You would
                    get the occasional St. Johns kid out there sort of with a sign or something like
                    that. No one took them seriously. They were sort of a harmless bunch of kids.
                    They were nice kids and the midshipmen didn't seem to much care one way or the
                    other. We were pretty isolated from all of that and they're reading about it.
                    Most of the kids were very conservative and of course they were very much
                    opposed to these sorts of anti-war protests. Of course the officer cadre were
                    all just up in arms about “How can we let these guys march and why don't we
                    arrest them all?” and that sort of thing. It was a very conservative crowd. I
                    must confess to sort of being close to that mind set myself in those years. We
                    were isolated from it, we really were. Annapolis was this pleasant little town
                    and on the walled compound of the Naval Academy where we lived and our friends
                    were all of the Naval Academy faculty and staff, we were isolated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand because my home town is Annapolis and I grew
                        up there from '39 to '50 until I went away. I understand how isolated one
                        can be there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>GIBSON: I'll tell you a story. You're talking about the troubles in society. I
                    noticed it first when Hubert Humphrey came to speak at San Jose State in his
                    campaign when he was running for vice president. That must have been in '64. I
                    guess we were starting to get involved in Vietnam. We were there. I remember
                    having a mate in one of my classes who had been a sky rigger pilot and had been
                    doing some time over there. Hubert Humphrey came around and he was heckled. I
                    remember him being heckled by people about the war, partly, and he handled it
                    very well. He was really a smooth guy. Then I sort of graduated and went off to
                    East Asia and into the Navy cocoon where I was sort of isolated from it,
                    too.</p>
                <p>But then I remember coming back from, I guess I had just gotten back from the
                    Gulf of Tonkin and my wife and I went up to visit her cousin in San Francisco.
                    We went to a party and we are all standing around in there. I am the only guy
                    there that has got a short haircut and has shaved within the last month. All I
                    hear is all this stuff which to me is constant. The Vietnam War was a big topic
                    of conversation. Finally, I was just getting angry. I remember being angry
                    because it wasn't the guys fighting them, we were just doing our job. If we
                    volunteered to go it is one thing but if we didn't volunteer they were going to
                    round us up and send us. I remember standing around in the kitchen near the
                    refrigerator. There were about four or five people and finally one of them said
                    to me “What do you do?” I was so pissed off at the time that I looked him in the
                    eye and said “I kill people.” I'm in the Navy and I had just got back from
                    Vietnam and I'm a gunnery officer. I was just so angry at that but talk about
                    putting a stop to a conversation and being left alone in the kitchen. I guess
                    they thought I was so aggressive that they didn't even want to beat up on me.
                    But basically I don't recall much of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had your five year commitment. Were you beginning to
                        look out, realize that this was not your thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: You know, I did. I enrolled at the University of Maryland in their
                    graduate program. I was going to work on my Ph.D. I got in there and started
                    doing that. I'd take a course here and a course there. I guess about a
                    year-and-a-half before I got out of the Navy, we always in those days had a
                    Foreign Service officer posted to English, history and government. I don't know
                    if the job is still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes it's still there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I was blessed with having two very interesting guys during my three years
                    there though I can't remember the names of either one of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Jack Mendelson one of them by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GIBSON: No. The first guy I thought was Phil something. He left. He had been in
                    Cambodia and Vietnam. He left, got out of the Service and went to work for Gulf
                    Oil, doubling his salary and then something, in the international relations
                    area. The guy who replaced him had been CG or consul in Nassau. He had been in
                    the bombing of our embassy in Saigon, the one in '64 or '65 with all the flying
                    glass. I can't remember the guys name. I told these guys, “boy that sounds like
                    it would be kind of fun”. You know who taught there too at the time, he taught
                    Russian history, Jim Ponds, Jim? He became ambassador to somewhere or DCM in
                    Moscow or something. He had a very successful career. I can't remember his
                    name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can always add that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Anyway it sounded like it was kind of fun. Another guy who's still in the
                    service, another who had a very successful career, everyone but me. We went down
                    to the test and we passed the test. They would come back to you and say “when do
                    you want to come in?” I said “I have a year or year-and-a-half on my obligation.
                    They said “we can get you out of that.” I said, “No, I've made an obligation and
                    I made a deal with the Navy. I will do my five years.” What it really was, I
                    wasn't sure that I wanted to go in and work for the State Department. I still
                    wanted to stay in the Navy. So as the Navy time was coming around, I said to
                    them that what I wanted to do was make a deal. I said I will go augment, meaning
                    go regular Navy, if you will change my designator to 1630. I was an 1100.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Unrestricted line officer, you drive ships. That is all you are going to
                    do in your life. I want to be an intelligence officer. Change me to Intelligence
                    and I will augment and you will have a career guy. They came back and said no,
                    we don't need any Intelligence officers but boy do we have some great jobs for
                    you on the big gray things that are going to go out and cruise the ocean again.
                    I just kept fooling around and finally it was clear that they weren't going to
                    let me go intelligence so I said “Okay, bye, guys” and I went to work for the
                    State Department. It was pretty close, it was a close decision. I almost didn't
                    leave the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you passed the written exam, did you take an oral
                        exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Wonderful process. First of all, be aware as you probably know back in
                    those days the written exam was a whole day. We went down to civil service
                    headquarters in D.C. and spent the whole day down there taking this silly
                    test.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking to somebody who took a three-and-a-half day
                        exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I know another guy who took that. Anyway, it was a long exam. Then I got
                    notified and fairly soon took the oral test. I can't remember where I took it to
                    tell you the truth, somewhere down in D.C. There were three guys, two were State
                    and one was a USIS officer. There were three in a row at a table and I was
                    sitting on a chair in front of them isolated. I didn't have a little table in
                    front of me, I was just sitting on a chair under their direct gaze.</p>
                <p>It pretty quickly became clear that it was good guys, bad guys. Two of them were
                    sort of good guys and there was the bad guy, the heavy, who kept asking the
                    tough questions and sort of digging and sort of making facial expressions that
                    indicated is that the best you can do, that sort of thing. I'm sitting there in
                    front of them for about an hour-and-a-half and they drilled me on all kinds of
                    obscure things. I thought that the written test had enough arcane questions on
                    it but theses guys were something. They just drilled me for about an
                    hour-and-a-half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I remembered some. I remember one was “Oh, you have an interest in Asia.
                    Well we're going to give Okinawa back to the Japanese.” I think that was
                    actually in May of '72. “How do you think the Okinawans are going to be treated
                    by the Japanese?” I said “Just the way they are treated.” They are a lower form
                    of life. They are not a lower form of life, they are discriminated against by
                    the mainland Japanese and there is not a lot of love. So I explained all that,
                    it was one.</p>
                <p>I remember being asked by the USIS guy, who seemed to me to be the heavy, about
                    American culture and its influence around the world. Well I didn't have any
                    knowledge of it. I had been spreading culture with a five inch 38ths cannon. I
                    didn't have time for this stuff. So I said “naturally there is jazz,” and of
                    course I don't know anything about jazz. He said “What are some of your favorite
                    jazz artists?” I said “I don't really have any favorites, I just know that jazz
                    is very popular.” He asked “What kind of music do you like?” I said “I like
                    classical,” which I did, and of course I could answer a lot of his questions
                    about favorite composers and that sort of thing. They asked me about hobbies and
                    at the time it was photography. Actually I used to take pictures of flowers in
                    close-ups and so we talked about flower photography.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>He asked me some other questions, especially the USIS guy. I just figured, I'm
                    not a BSer, I am not going to lie to them. So I'd say, “I don't have a clue.”
                    Sorry I can't get you there rather than try to get myself down in some quagmire
                    of B.S. What were some of the other ones? I guess on current events. I mean a
                    lot of what was going on in the world at the time, that sort of thing. I
                    remember the one on Japan because it turned out that I later served on Okinawa
                    and I remembered that question. But that's about all I really remember, but I
                    remember it was tough.</p>
                <p>Then they sent me down the hall and I sat down in a little room. They said to go
                    down there and wait. A few minutes later one of the guys come in. Not the USIS
                    guy, it was one of the good cops. He comes to me and says “Congratulations Mr.
                    Gibson you've passed and we'll put you on the register. Now which cone would you
                    like to be in?” “Cone?” He explained the four cones and I said “I'd like to do
                    admin work because I'd administered men on a ship, I'd done budgets and been on
                    audit boards and that sort of thing.” He said, “You don't really have the
                    academic background to be an administrative officer. You don't have a degree in
                    business or something like that. How would you like to be a consular officer?”
                    “Okay.” He put me down as a consular officer. I didn't care, I just wanted to be
                    in the Foreign Service. I wasn't even sure I wanted to be in, I just wanted to
                    have the opportunity. He says “OK, I think you'll be a good consular officer.”
                    He went away and a year-and-a-half later or so I became a Foreign Service
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I got out of the Navy I think officially sometime in late June of '71 and
                    I think it was very early July when I officially got in. So I didn't, as we say,
                    miss a paycheck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, I assume you took the basic officer
                        course, A-100?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you characterize the class and your impression of the
                        group that you came in with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>GIBSON: There were 36 people in there. At the time if you were 29 you could come
                    into the Foreign Service, if you were 30 you could not, if I understand it. Or
                    it may be if you're 28 you could come in, but I think it was 29 you could come
                    in so we were all kind of young. There was a mixed State and USIS class. I'm
                    just guessing that maybe eight or nine were USIS officers and the rest of us
                    were State. Maybe ten were USIS officers, something like that. We are all
                    basically young. Probably half of the guys were former military vets. We had a
                    West Point grad who had made major and got out just in time, he was the oldest
                    guy. I was one of the older guys in there. Navy, Air Force, Army, a lot of us
                    were vets in the class. We had a fair sprinkling of women and we had a Hispanic
                    guy, maybe three or four African American officers. We had sort of a mixed
                    class.</p>
                <p>Most of them were very enthusiastic. A lot of us spoke languages already which of
                    course was intimidating for guys like me who didn't speak any language. We had
                    all these guys speak all these languages: French, Indonesian, Thai, German and
                    all these languages. It was a very close class. There was a real feeling of
                    camaraderie and we all got along. I am sure there must have been little
                    personnel differences among some of them but I just recall it as being a very
                    close, very happy group and that was partly because of our handlers, the guys
                    running the A-100 course. I can't remember their names, I'd know it if I heard
                    them. It was a very close group and a lot of the officers out of it did very
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point you were removed from sort of the cocoon of
                        the Navy and although many of you were from military background, by '71 we
                        were sort of disconnecting from Vietnam but it was still a matter of great
                        debate and all of that. Were you picking up any of that within your group?
                        Was Vietnam discussed at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Only in the sense that some of us wanted to go there for CORDS, but they
                    had discontinued it. I guess until two or three classes before, everybody almost
                    went to CORDS which is what I wanted to do. I wanted to go to CORDS, I thought
                    that would be a lot of fun. None of us could go to CORDS. Obviously as you say,
                    we are winding down, we're pulling back. So we talked about it in that sense
                    from the standpoint of assignments and that sort of thing joking like: oh yeah
                    we all want to go to CORDS but we can't, too bad, let's go somewhere else, let's
                    go to Paris. We're all vets and we would tell sea stories or whatever but I
                    don't remember really the war being a controversial thing. I am sure we must
                    have talked about it because many of us had been there and we sort of swapped
                    sea stories as I said, but I don't recall it being a real issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Later in my Foreign Service career, I had the misfortune to sit at a table on an
                    off-site training thing with three other officers. One of them was quite nice
                    but the other two jumped all over me because it came out that I had been in the
                    military and had been in Vietnam. This was in the late '70s about '78 or so.
                    They just jumped all over me like “How could you have done that?” I had an
                    answer which I though was rather clever. I said, and it was the truth, “Because
                    it was the greatest thing out of my generation and I didn't want to miss it. I
                    didn't miss it and I'm glad I didn't miss it but I wish it hadn't happened.”
                    They weren't happy with that. Boy they jumped all over me, but that was much
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, did you want to go
                        somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I wanted to go to Asia because that was were my interests were. I wanted
                    to go to Japan or somewhere out in Asia but there weren't any good Asian
                    assignments on the list so I got my second choice. My first choice was
                    Casablanca because I'm a romantic at heart. I'd seen the movie. One of my good
                    friends in the course who has remained a friend, I haven't seen him in a few
                    years but we crossed paths again, he got that. I got my second choice which was
                    Fort of France in Martinique which has since closed of course. My friend Mike
                    Mahoney, went to Casablanca. Mike said to me later when we were in personnel
                    together, “The reason you got Martinique”, Mike wanted Martinique too, “is you
                    got it because you were married.” One of the class guys or personnel guys told
                    Mike that the reason Mike didn't get it was that Martinique wasn't very good for
                    a bachelor. It was better to have a married man, a family man, down there. So I
                    was with family and I went, and Mike went to Casablanca. That was sort of
                    temporary and from there I got assigned to Rangoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Martinique for a bit. You were in
                        Martinique when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: February of '72 after 19 weeks of French with a wonderful grade of 1/+2
                    or was it 2/1+, I've forgotten. It wasn't very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a very low grade. You had to bring
                        yourself up to a three I think in order to get off language probation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, so I obviously was still on language probation. I went there in
                    February of '72 and I replaced an officer who you may know, Marty Chesses, who
                    was on his third or fourth tour. I don't know where he learned French but his
                    French was beautiful. If not bilingual, damn close. The boss, I found out after
                    I got down there, had sent a steady stream of messages back to Washington
                    opposing my assignment because I wasn't good enough in French. He was overruled
                    and so I go down and Marty goes on to somewhere else. Our paths have crossed
                    once or twice since then. I was there from February of '72 until November,
                    Thanksgiving Day or the day after, of 1973. That was my first assignment.
                    Martinique at the time was a small post. There was the principal officer, there
                    was me, an American secretary and I think something like six local employees. We
                    covered Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana as well as the French part of
                    St. Martin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: With the esteemed position of vice consul, I did all the visa work
                    naturally and I did the commercial work. I did all the WTDRs, World Trade
                    Directory Reports. I handled things like working with police, when the Bureau of
                    Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs came down I would liaise with them, and when the
                    Coast Guard came down I'd have to work with the Coast Guard guys. The boss spent
                    his time working the political side of the street and economic reporting, what
                    little there was. At that time there was a fairly strong movement for either
                    autonomy or independence, depending on where you stood on the spectrum, from
                    France. The boss spent most of his time following that, the independence
                    autonomous movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when the Caribbean nations were all
                        becoming independent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Right. The Martiniqueans wanted to become independent as well. Some did,
                    some didn't. The complicating factor was always that the French government was
                    pumping tremendous amounts of money into the island. The French kept making it
                    very clear that in your current status as an overseas department, we are going
                    to keep pumping money in. If you want another kind of status, we're going to
                    talk about how much money we're going to pump in. The economy simply would have
                    collapsed without the French. I don't know if it is still that way today. I
                    would not be surprised if that were the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French had made the point very clear in Africa to
                        those Francophone countries that did not want to have close relations to
                        France. They took everything including the faucets off the fixtures. How did
                        you find Foreign Service life?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Loved it. Loved Martinique. My wife hated it. I had been trained in
                    French for what it was worth and I studied real hard while I was there. I got a
                    tutor and studied real hard. It was an R&amp;R post and I came back about a year
                    into the assignment, passed my test and went on back. My wife didn't come back.
                    She did not speak any French. Those were the days when they would not pay for
                    your spouse to study a foreign language. I had taken a pay cut from the Navy to
                    come into the State Department in the first place. We had a little boy.
                    Martinique was very expensive. Right before we had gone down there had been the
                    Smithsonian Conference where right after that they devalued the dollar against
                    the franc, let the dollar float I guess is what they did. It was just punishing
                    down there financially so we did not have the money to have my wife study
                    French. We weren't going to direct the money into that so she never learned
                    French. Martinique had very few English speakers and so when we came up after
                    home leave, she stayed in the States for several months. I went back down alone.
                    She eventually came back down not long before I left. She and our son stayed
                    with her parents in California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any consular issues there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No. There were a lot of the visa things. There were a lot of American
                    death cases. On cruise ships an elderly portion of the population would come
                    down and they would overdo on a hike or something or they would be sick before
                    they got on the boat. That was also a period in the early '70s in the United
                    States when we started the process of if people who had mental problems and they
                    weren't a danger to themselves or society, we were sort of letting them out.
                    Many of those guys ended up on Martinique. I had cases with mentally ill people
                    about every couple of months. Every couple of three months, I had one. These
                    were guys who were really wacko and we had to get them out of Martinique, back
                    up to the States and arrange with the right kind of social agency either Social
                    Security or Health, I don't know if it was HEW at the time. We would arrange so
                    they would be sort of met at the plane and be taken care of and this sort of
                    thing. It's not funny and these are people with real problems but some of the
                    circumstances that got created were just hilarious. To this day my wife and I
                    trade these stories. Some of the best sea stories I've ever gotten out of the
                    Foreign Service were dealing with these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: There were some great ones. I'll tell you the one that was the scariest.
                    There was an American down there who was observed one night walking around buck
                    naked with a 22 rifle over his shoulder. How he ever got it into Martinique I
                    have not the foggiest notion. He was walking around until about midnight or one
                    o'clock in the morning. He then went back to his hotel and he was sort of
                    followed. He had been with a prostitute and she rolled him I guess or something
                    like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what rolling means?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: At some point during their business transaction she lifted his wallet and
                    clothes and apparently disappeared. That was it. He was out looking for her with
                    a 22 rifle. It had been in his room so he could have put new clothes on but he
                    didn't bother. I got a call the very next morning from the police. The hotel
                    people had called the police and the police had called me. I can remember they
                    wanted me to go talk to this guy at the door. I can remember like in the movie
                    where you stand to the side and you knock on the door because you are afraid
                    that bullets are going to come through the door. I talked him into opening the
                    door and going away with the nice policemen. They carried his 22 rifle for him
                    so he didn't have to carry it. That was sort of scary.</p>
                <p>There was a Club Med down there. There was a long, curving banister that went up
                    to the second floor at the Club Med. This guy appeared at the head of the
                    banister dressed in women's underwear and slid down the banister into the mob
                    down below. They carted him off. We had people who would just go berserk and
                    tear their hotel room all apart. I had another guy who was pursued either by the
                    crime syndicate or the CIA or both and he wasn't sure which. He was going to
                    leave the islands and go the Virgin Islands or Venezuela, of course, the
                    opposite direction. We had guys like that coming through. A woman in retrospect
                    must have had Alzheimers, had gotten off a cruise ship and gotten lost. One
                    woman I'm speaking to her with the ships agent trying to get her repatriated
                    back up the States. The ships agent was being very cooperative. She was just as
                    sweet and nice to me: “Oh, you're such a nice young man.” Within five minutes
                    she had turned on me, venomous swearing at me and telling me what a dirt ball I
                    was and that sort of thing. There were just a whole series of cases like
                    that.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you another interesting case that we had, back to the Vietnam War. The
                    regional FBI office down in Caracas I think it was, told us that there was a guy
                    on Martinique from Montana. In Montana he had planted a bomb to destroy several
                    National Guard trucks and vehicles at a National Guard armory to protest the
                    Vietnam War. He had then fled the country with a warrant out for his arrest. We
                    sort of knew that this guy was around. One day he walked into my office and
                    tells me that he is going to renounce his citizenship and he wants to know how
                    to do that. He was really kind of a nice guy and a young guy. I said “You don't
                    want renounce your citizenship. They won't drop charges against you.” It came
                    out, and he was quite open, that he was the fugitive. I said “By renouncing your
                    citizenship it's not a get out of jail free card, you still have to pay the
                    price if you come back to the States whether you're French or anything else.” He
                    said, “Oh yeah, I know that. I've been just so turned off by the war and the
                    whole nature of the U.S. government” and so on and so on that he wanted to
                    renounce his citizenship. I said “Go back and think about it.” He said “No, I
                    don't want to think about it.” I said “I don't know, I've never done this
                    before. I've got to do some paperwork.” I was stalling hoping I could talk him
                    out of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Meanwhile I told the FBI guy that he was there and they contacted the French
                    police to get him arrested. He came back again I guess before the French police
                    arrested him. Finally he just kept insisting and he said he was going to write
                    his congressman if I didn't let him renounce his citizenship. There was a wife
                    or a girlfriend, I don't know if she was French. I said I don't need a
                    congressional, I get enough of those on visa cases. I said “here's how you do
                    it”, and he did it. Then the FBI got him arrested and tried to extradite him. I
                    remember taking him books in his jail cell and that sort of thing. He was a real
                    nice guy. The French would not extradite him because his crimes had been
                    political and he didn't hurt anybody or anything. The French let him out of jail
                    and gave him a laissez pass� and I'm told by the FBI that he went to Algeria
                    first and then to France. The debris of the war was still going around. He was a
                    fascinating guy. I can't remember his name. A real nice fellow. In fact in
                    better times, we probably would have been friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '73. What were you asking for and what did you
                        get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: This was before the days of open assignments. In those days we didn't
                    have the open assignment list where you asked for anything. Maybe if you had
                    been around for a while, like Steve Kenny had been around a while and knew the
                    ropes. I didn't have a clue. I got a message one day from a guy on the French
                    desk, why he was on the French desk and doing this I just can't figure out. He
                    said “How would you like to go to Rangoon?” What he had to do with Rangoon is
                    still to this day totally unclear to me. I said wow, great, I get to go to Asia.
                    So I said “Yeah, I'll go to Rangoon.” Nothing is special about Rangoon, I just
                    wanted to get to Asia. The next thing I knew I was processed and I got a set of
                    orders for Rangoon. I had no idea what else was open or what other possibilities
                    were before me but I heard Rangoon. I had come of age in the Navy and if the
                    Navy said go here, okay. So the State Department said go here, okay. Out of
                    A-100 we did get to list three or four choices and they showed us what was open,
                    that was fine. To me I thought that was kind of strange. Coming out of
                    Martinique they just phoned me and said “do you want to go?” And I said “yeah”
                    so that's where we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Rangoon from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: 18 months. It was back in the days when junior officer assignments were
                    18 months, at least in Rangoon. I got there in January of '74 and I left in July
                    of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assignment in Rangoon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Vice consul. There was a one officer visa section and I had me, a
                    Sino-Burmese guy and a Burmese woman. We were the consular section.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your wife think about this? Was this more to her
                        liking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, I guess so. She had been totally unhappy in Martinique because she
                    couldn't communicate with anybody. It is such a small community and the
                    relationships between the boss, the American secretary, and myself were not
                    good. The American secretary drank too much and it was just not a happy work
                    environment. She was delighted to get out of there and she liked the idea of
                    going to Asia. She had been subjected in Martinique by the local population to
                    racist remarks and leering and that sort of thing. She did not really feel
                    comfortable. She liked the idea of going back to Asia where she looked like
                    everybody else. She loved Rangoon, as did I. Of course, I loved Martinique. I
                    was happy everywhere I went. I never had a posting I didn't like. She was quite
                    happy to go there.</p>
                <p>I was consular officer and I guess my predecessor had been a full time consular
                    officer. I found that there wasn't enough to do to keep me busy so I kept
                    pestering the political, economic and admin. guys for other things. They would
                    give me their scruff work. I got the E&amp;E plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the emergency plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The emergency evacuation plan. They gave me civil aviation, so I did work
                    on that. Then the chief of the political economic combined section, who turned
                    out to be a very close friend of the family for years thereafter, let me do
                    about whatever I wanted. I did reports on things like their judiciary system,
                    the legal system. It was sort of the peripheral stuff that your normal political
                    officer doesn't get around to. I did a lot of interesting stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: When I first got there we didn't have one. I think Dirk Byroad had just
                    left. John Lacey was the charg�. A nice fellow. I think that may have been his
                    last assignment. Not long after I got there David Osborne came and he was the
                    ambassador until I left. A remarkable guy. Too bad you can't interview him. He
                    died, he was killed in an accident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he run the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GIBSON: I'm really not a very good bureaucrat. I just sort of did my job, sort of
                    played around and that sort of thing. I don't know how he ran the embassy. He
                    was a very nice man. I found working for him to be perfectly fine. John Lacey
                    transferred and we got a new DCM, Richard (I've forgot his last name). He was a
                    very nice man. This was probably towards the end of my assignment. Lacey was
                    ill, I think. Anyway, David Osborne was one of the smartest guys you ever want
                    to meet. He taught himself Burmese and within six months of being there was
                    giving speeches in Burmese. I heard him speak French at cocktail parties and
                    such. He spoke tremendously good French. I know he spoke Chinese and
                    Japanese.</p>
                <p>Here's an interesting story on David Osborne. We had an American club which still
                    exists in Rangoon on a compound, and the Brits had a club. The Brits allowed the
                    Aussies to be in their club. It wasn't a big embassy community, there were
                    something like 20 embassies or so. Our club had a reciprocal relationship with
                    any club that gave us reciprocal privileges and that meant the British club. So
                    there was the American club and the British club. It was a very white
                    environment there.</p>
                <p>David came in one day and said “I want you to run for office. I want you to be
                    elected to the American club board (or the American Association board). I want
                    you to run for it.” He didn't really tell me why, it was just that he wanted me
                    to be on it as a consular officer. So I did and I got a seat. Then we met and
                    chose the president and I became the president of the board. David Osborne comes
                    to me and says “OK Dick what I want you to do is I want you to integrate the
                    club.” He tried not to be heavy handed, he could have just ordered it, but that
                    was his style. You're the president, you do it. I agreed with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the context of integrating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Let somebody besides the Brits enter the club, other diplomats from other
                    countries: Indians, not Chinese they wouldn't have joined it anyway, Thai,
                    Japanese, or Bengali or anybody. I waged a several months, well it seemed like a
                    long time, campaign to integrate the club like that. Over the dead body of most
                    of the board members, not most but I gathered a majority of one or something
                    like that, we passed a new rule saying that Americans are the voting members and
                    everybody else is like an associate member. They don't get to vote and we can
                    limit the number of them so that we don't overcrowd the facilities and so forth.
                    Limit it to diplomats because we were having duty free booze and food served
                    there and that sort of thing. We did it and basically it was because David was
                    giving me all the support that I needed. At the end we had a club that had
                    Japanese, Indians and sort of French, and we had a variety of people in there
                    for a change.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>One of the things that struck me was the hostility on the part of a large part of
                    the American embassy community to integrating the club that way. I could never
                    really figure it out and this may not sound right but we basically had an
                    embassy of about 55 people of which how many were State you could imagine that.
                    There seemed to be the officer level State people, as opposed to secretaries
                    necessarily, and the USIS people, they seemed pretty much at ease with this. The
                    communicator community, the technical people in the embassy had a large segment
                    of people that were basically red necks and the hostility toward integrating the
                    club having non-Anglos in the pool, I found it amazing. But anyway it happened
                    and I made a lot of enemies but it worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Burma in the '74 to '75
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We were very controlled. We could go right out in the immediate area
                    around Rangoon. We still had a consulate at the time in Mandalay and we booked
                    Mandalay, but as diplomats we couldn't go very far without special permission
                    from the government. We would send a dip note to the government and they would
                    take their own sweet time about answering. Sometimes they would let us go and
                    sometimes they wouldn't, normally they wouldn't. Their excuse was had something
                    to do with some Russians that were kidnapped in about 1972 or 1973, it is foggy
                    in my mind now.</p>
                <p>Khun Sa had been arrested, I think, in '71 by the Burmese government. Khun Sa is
                    the notorious drug trafficker up in the Golden Triangle area. He was arrested by
                    the Burmese and put in jail in I think '71. In the next year or the year after,
                    his henchmen kidnapped a couple of Russian doctors or engineers from the town of
                    Taunggyi which is in the Shan State. They held them and they wanted to do a
                    trade. The Burmese government held off for a long time and these poor Russian
                    guys, I don't know where they were held, they weren't mistreated or anything but
                    they were just held captive for a year or so, I'd have to go back and check on
                    that. The idea was that was the excuse the government used: if you guys travel
                    up there they are going to kidnap you and make trouble with you, for us and
                    everybody else so we can't let you go to sensitive areas. I think it was also
                    that they didn't want us over there nosing around. There are all kinds of games
                    played there. Anyway, we were very compliant. We couldn't go a lot of
                    places.</p>
                <p>Any time a Burmese official had any kind of conversation with an American, the
                    Burmese official had to write it up in a formal report and submit it. So if you
                    invited a Burmese official to your house it was almost impossible to get them
                    there except the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these guys could come. A very
                    secretive, closed society, much like it is today. They were very suspicious and
                    xenophobic and didn't want to have anything to do with us basically.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>There were three sets of public disturbances during my years there. One was the
                    famous thing when U Thant died and his funeral turned into a riot. There were a
                    couple of other student type of launched things. One with students and one with
                    workers and the two never met. You couldn't get the workers and the students to
                    unite and go out there and do it together. You'd have either the students and
                    they'd have to be put down, then the workers and they had to be put down. Three
                    different times, it was not a happy place.</p>
                <p>Socially, the diplomatic community hung around with the diplomatic community. No
                    official would hang around with you. It was the kiss of death to be too friendly
                    to the foreigners. It was poor and things didn't work. The army ran things.
                    Pretty much it has changed, it's better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Burma at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Our interests were very limited. We had almost no meaningful contact with
                    the Rangoon government at the time but there was starting to be sort of a
                    rapprochement on narcotics. This was all not at my level. This was going on
                    around me and I wasn't really aware of it. We were by '72 or '73 well into
                    negotiations with the Burmese to begin what became a rather long lasting program
                    of providing them with airplanes, helicopters, and communications, non-lethal
                    equipment to use in suppressing the drug trafficking in the Shan State. This was
                    going on and it was causing closer ties but it was more the clandestine side of
                    the house that was taking care of this. McAvoy was there and he was the station
                    chief. He's now with Continental or maybe he's retired from Continental by now
                    but he did very well. He was a VP or big in Continental Airlines. Anyway, he I
                    think was engineering the whole thing. I think he basically took care of that
                    and then State got involved of course and that sort of thing. There was starting
                    to be a program on narcotics cooperation there and that was really the big
                    thing. We had the attach�s and they would hang out with the Thai army and the
                    air force. But there was no real political exchange.</p>
                <p>There was the famous story by David Osborne. This is such a great story that
                    you've got to have it in here. We got one of these stupid things that the
                    department was so good at sending out to all diplomatic and consular posts.
                    We're negotiating at the time with the Brits for Diego Garcia to build our bases
                    in the Indian Ocean. We were going to build a base, which we eventually built,
                    and the British let us have our base there. We got this all diplomatic and
                    consular posts notice wanting us to ascertain the reaction of the host country
                    to the development of this as a base. This is the process and naturally the
                    Indians were up in arms about it and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>They wanted to know obviously how the Burmese felt about it. David Osborne didn't
                    even bother to go in and talk to the Burmese but the message came in and we all
                    saw the message. As the consular officer, chief bottle washer, the whole thing,
                    I got to be at the country team meeting. At the next country team meeting I am
                    sitting there and David has got this cable and he says “I think you have all
                    seen this cable. I don't know if you have seen my response yet.” He sort of
                    passed it around. The response is a one liner. It says the Burmese think that
                    Diego Garcia is a Cuban cigar. That's exactly right. The Burmese weren't going
                    to say anything. Regardless of what they thought they weren't going to say
                    anything about it because they were very in control. Had they their druthers,
                    who knows what they really felt but they weren't going to say anything.</p>
                <p>I am told that that is what ruined David Osborne's career because when he left
                    Rangoon he ended up on the inspection board. The story is that Henry Kissinger
                    read that and went ballistic. Apparently he ranted and raved, threw it down and
                    complained that this was like an insult to him for asking this question and this
                    sort of thing, this was like flippancy. He was really upset. The story is that
                    this basically scuttled Osborne's career. I don't know if it is true or not, who
                    knows, but it was a great story. The cable was great. I may have missed a word
                    or two but basically it was a one liner.</p>
                <p>In short, we have almost no trade with Burma. Our only interest there at the time
                    was twofold. There was the drug question. The second one was the BCP, the Burma
                    Communist Party, which was then heavily supported by the Chinese. It occupied a
                    very large portion of northeastern Burma in the Wa, Konkan and northern Shan
                    States, part of the Kachin State I think. These guys basically ran that section
                    of the country and the Burma army was always there fighting with them all of the
                    time, ramping up on them, and being ramped up on and it was sort of like a
                    stalemate. Meanwhile there was another faction of the Burma Communist Party that
                    the old sort of pro-Russian remnants had been in down in the actual Burman area
                    of the country. While I was there the Burma army rounded up the last of them,
                    killed the leaders. They were captured dead as the Burmese newspapers liked to
                    say. The insurgency in the northeast we were watching because the Indochina mess
                    was still sorting out. It had pretty much been sorted out by then. I remember
                    Vietnam fell while I was there and Cambodia fell while I was there.</p>
                <p>I will tell you two interesting stories about that. The first is that all of the
                    old Asian hands at post were saying what's going to happen is the Vietnamese are
                    going to just go down there and massacre the southerners and the Cambodians are
                    just going to lay back and just sort of forget about it. In retrospect it was
                    the exact opposite which I found interesting. So much for conventional
                    wisdom.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The other thing was there Vietnam fell in April of '75, in February there was
                    that famous battle in the highlands at Ban Me Thuot which sort of when that
                    went, everybody fell. I didn't know anything about it but my colleagues who knew
                    something about Vietnam said that's bad guys, it's really close to the end.
                    Anyway right around the beginning of the year Josiah Bennett (I think that was
                    his name) who I think was the political counselor in Saigon, was on a tour in
                    Southeast Asia going from embassy to embassy giving the light at the end of the
                    tunnel speech. It was the most unreal thing I've ever seen in my life. We are
                    all sitting there in the bubble, in the special room where we have secret
                    meetings, and Bennett is sitting in there telling everybody all these good signs
                    on how the South Vietnamese were getting their act together and they're dancing
                    here and they're pulling this thing this out. We were all sitting there looking
                    at each other. We all have to read papers and we know what is going on. The more
                    senior guys were sitting there looking very intent and nodding and all of us
                    young guys are looking around at each other and are thinking, wait a minute
                    what's going on around here? It was the light at the end of the tunnel speech.
                    We got out and just couldn't believe it and started talking amongst ourselves.
                    Within four months of course it is over. It was unreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was reflecting Graham Martin, this was his job. What
                        I'm saying is that whole thing was really a very peculiar situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I guess so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in power? Was it Ne Win? What sort of estimate did
                        people have of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: He ruled with an iron hand. There was no doubt who was in charge. At the
                    time he was always going to Europe for medical treatments for one thing or
                    another so there was always talk about he's not going to make it. He's still
                    alive today, so so much for that conventional wisdom, too. He was very
                    reclusive. A very hard man to get to see. The story was the U.S. ambassador
                    probably would see him when they presented credentials and if they were lucky
                    they would see him at their exit farewell visit. Nobody saw him in-between. He
                    was reclusive even then and more reclusive now. The big gossip around town was
                    that his son, who was a pilot and flew for Burma Airways, I guess at one time he
                    had flown in the air force or something, was alleged to be a heroin addict. I
                    don't know if that was true or not, it was the talk. It was said that that was
                    one of the reasons why Ne Win himself was so interested in the anti-drug program
                    of the United States. In retrospect I think that is nonsense. I think Ne Win was
                    interested in it because the drug trade was supporting and funding the
                    insurgency which denied him control of the entire country. He wanted our
                    equipment to ramp up on these guys so he could control his country. The
                    daughter, who was said to be very bright, very capable, and very influential,
                    and I guess she still is, but very secretive and nobody ever saw them much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was told about the one entree to the ruling group of
                        military people was golf. Was that true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, golf, but also in Rangoon, tennis was very popular. The guys who had
                    the very best access in Rangoon were the military guys, the attach�s. There were
                    two. There was an army attach� who was the DAT and there was an air force
                    attach� who was the assistant. There was a naval attach� in Bangkok who was
                    still accredited. These guys had the most access of anybody because the military
                    ran the country and they had to deal with the military. They played golf but
                    they played tennis an awful lot. Tennis seemed to be the really popular game
                    there. That's where I learned to play tennis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dissidents and all that? Would you have people
                        coming in to the consular section being dissident or anything of that
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We did have one defection when I was there as I recall, but I wasn't
                    involved with it, Clyde Boyce was. It was some Bulgarian diplomat or some
                    Eastern European diplomat who defected but I don't know the details of it. No,
                    we didn't have any dissidents. We had very little business in the consular work
                    because it was very hard to get a visa to leave. Most of our visas were A visas,
                    official visas for diplomats going to the United Nations or wherever. We were
                    issuing a lot of immigrant visas at the time but they were going to mainly
                    ethnic Chinese and Indians.</p>
                <p>When I first got there the Burmese had just finished up shipping large numbers of
                    Indians back to India. India said look, all you overseas Indians if you are in
                    bad places like that, come on back and we will help you get settled. Many of the
                    Indians in Burma took the offer and went back. Indians were in mainly unskilled
                    laborer type jobs and the Burmese being very xenophobic, were very anti-Indian.
                    Indians took a lot of abuse, discrimination and that sort of thing. The same
                    with the Chinese. They were very suspicious of the Chinese. The Chinese were
                    back in the Cultural Revolution, the insurgency up on the border and all this
                    sort of thing. They weren't Burmese citizens, they had Taiwan passports. They
                    were allowed to leave and so they had to get an exit visa before they came to
                    see us. Most of the Indians were going back to India. We took quite a few
                    Chinese immigrants.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>That was in the days when they had a program where if you had a skill, trade, or
                    profession that was in short supply in the United States you could come.
                    Actually that program had been stopped a couple years before I got to Rangoon.
                    Under that program, if you were an auto mechanic, if you were a cook, if you
                    were a cabinetmaker, you could get a visa. The program was discontinued but
                    there was some kind of a court challenge that forced it to be reinstated and all
                    those on the waiting list who had signed up to come in, had to be adjudicated.
                    We had an awful lot of these guys who came in the office and applied for visas
                    under these circumstances. They were almost all Chinese. I was a curious man and
                    started investigating them all. I investigated every single case and many of
                    them were fraudulent. If it was a carpenter, I would say make me a dovetail
                    joint. If it was an auto mechanic I'd say inside the distributor we've got this
                    or that, because I'd grown up working on cars, and so I could quickly figure out
                    if this guy even knew what a car was. That was basically our visa work.</p>
                <p>It was illegal for most Burmese to leave the country. For one they didn't have
                    any foreign exchange and if you were at all political involved with the old
                    regime in any way, they probably wouldn't give you a passport. Most Burmese who
                    wanted out would walk down to Thailand overland. They would dodge the army
                    patrols and the bandits and thugs along the way.</p>
                <p>What had happened, when the military regime took over for the second and
                    permanent time in 1962, the dominant merchant class, the people who dominated
                    the economy in the first 12, 13, 14 years of independence were Indians and
                    Chinese. No big surprise right? The Burmans set about nationalizing everything
                    they could get their hands on and basically driving these people out of the
                    country. The people who were leaving, many of them had been quite wealthy at one
                    time and they had big houses and had to sell them, practically desert them or
                    give them away in order to leave. It was really kind of sad. I got in on the
                    tail end of that. The Chinese were mostly the small merchant type but the
                    Indians, some of them had been big traders, financial dealings and big time
                    merchants and this sort of thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the riots, the student riots and the

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: You know I don't know. It wasn't in my turf and I don't remember. We were
                    concerned about it and took care of our own security and that sort of thing. We
                    didn't seem to have much to say about it. We reported it. Basically it is one of
                    those things that I don't recall any human rights type cables saying go in there
                    and tell the Burmese that they shouldn't shoot their own people. The Burmese
                    would have laughed at you, if they would give you an appointment. No I don't
                    remember any big response on our part except reporting on it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick it up in 1975 when you're the Burma desk
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 15th of April, 1998. Dick, in 1975 you were going to be doing
                    what?</p>
                <p>GIBSON: In July of 1975 I took a direct transfer back to the Department to an
                    office called EA/TB, the East Asia Bureau, Thai Burma Desk. My job on the desk
                    was one, to be the Burma desk officer and two, to be the officer for both
                    Thailand and Burma on narcotics issues. That second one ended up taking probably
                    as much, if not more, of my time than being Burma desk officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First you were on the desk from '75 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Summer of '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took over the desk how did you see the situation
                        in Burma and what were American interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: By the time I got on the desk, the American interest in Burma was
                    overwhelmingly narcotics and that is why they paired the two jobs basically. I
                    can not remember any other issues that we really had with the Burmese at that
                    time. It was totally narcotics as far as I recall. There would be the occasional
                    d�marche on a particular vote in the UN but we all knew we were just going
                    through the motions. The Burmese were going to vote or not vote as they saw fit.
                    We tried to follow the course of the communist insurgency but it was sort of
                    related to narcotics as well. Basically the issues were narcotics.</p>
                <p>We had already begun, or were in the early stages I suppose of providing
                    narcotics related assistance to the Rangoon government. I think the agreement
                    for that had been signed in '74 or I don't know if there was a formal agreement
                    even. An agreement had been reached and certainly there must have been a
                    memorandum of understanding or something like that in '74. I was not involved in
                    that while I was in Rangoon but when I got back to the desk, one of my major
                    jobs was to work very closely with an office at that time called S/NM which
                    stood for the Secretariat Narcotics Matters. The special advisor for narcotics
                    control or something like that was a man named Sheldon Vance a career diplomat.
                    We worked very closely with his office regarding narcotics related assistance to
                    both Burma and Thailand.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the perspective of the desk during this two year
                        period, how cooperative did you find the Burmese on narcotics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Actually we found them quite cooperative. It was in their interest. We
                    were providing them equipment which they would use for suppressing narcotics
                    trafficking organizations. The original purpose as I recall was to interdict
                    caravans heading south to the Thai border. It got expanded to taking base camps
                    and that sort of thing. At that time, as today, the political insurgents were
                    supporting their insurgency through narcotics. That was a big debate always. Are
                    these people ethnic political insurgents, freedom fighters, or whatever, or are
                    they drug trafficking thugs? Our view was they were primarily drug trafficking
                    thugs and I think that is probably still the American government's view of the
                    group. I agree with that. I don't have any problem with that. What we were doing
                    was giving the Burmese the opportunity to help themselves by suppressing their
                    armed political opposition, armed insurgencies, who were trafficking in drugs,
                    therefore meeting our objective as well. It was win-win.</p>
                <p>We weren't particularly intrusive. The Burmese were a little bit stubborn as they
                    would be about protecting their own prerogatives and national independence and
                    that sort of thing. They made it very clear that they would not have a bunch of
                    Americans running around the place looking at what they were doing with the
                    helicopters or the communications equipment that we were providing them. This
                    was all non-lethal stuff. We eventually provided them F-28 Fokker cargo aircraft
                    good for moving cargo. We also eventually provided them, well after I left, with
                    spray aircraft, like what crop dusters use, for spraying chemicals onto the
                    opium and destroying the crop that way. It just kept expanding.</p>
                <p>All this time the Burmese would fill in the paper work and give us reports. How
                    accurate the reports were, we had absolutely no way of knowing. As I recall at
                    least in the early days when I was there, they sounded reasonable and we
                    accepted them at face value. We had no real choice. They weren't going to let us
                    in and monitor everything which is not a particularly surprising attitude from
                    the Burmese. That's the way they are. They are xenophobic. They guard their
                    independence and their prerogatives but we found them cooperative enough.</p>
                <p>We would go over there and visit and they would take us out. They would be
                    cutting down opium fields for us, this was before the spraying. They would have
                    meetings with my bosses and I was there as the note taker type guy. They would
                    come over to the States and we would pay for an executive observation tour and
                    we would take them around and meet with DEA and with Customs. In general it was
                    a pretty good program at the time. A lot of people opposed the program.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>There were a lot of sort of the predecessors of today's anti-Burmese government
                    activists who were very much concerned that the helicopters, in particular,
                    would be used to suppress non-drug trafficking insurgent groups. Our view at the
                    time was non-drug trafficking groups in rebellion consisted of two: the Karen
                    and the Mon. That was basically because they were not in areas where opium was
                    available. We made it clear to the Burmese that this was for suppressing
                    trafficking groups. As time went on, the Burmese by all accusation actually did
                    use the helicopters against non-trafficking insurgents. In my time I don't
                    recall that happening but later on apparently that happened. There are enough
                    reports so I suspect they are true but I don't have any knowledge of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the human rights side come up again at all during the
                        time that you were on the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Not really. You know that was still a little bit before the human rights
                    emphasis and I don't recall human rights, while I was on the desk from '75 to
                    '77, being an issue with the assistance to Burma. Later on when we move to my
                    next job, it did become a bit of an issue but not much and I'll tell you why. In
                    those days, '75, '76, '77, I don't recall it being an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're moving to Thailand now from '75 to '77. There you
                        were dealing exclusively on the narcotics side is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Going back to the war years and even the pre-war years from the early
                    '50s on, we're really in bed with the Thai diplomatically, politically. We have
                    a lot of equities in Thailand. The military bases are winding down, fair enough.
                    But we've got a huge intelligence apparatus in Thailand for collecting data from
                    all over that part of the world, not just in Thailand. We have a very close
                    working relationship on intelligence issues with the Thai. Politically they back
                    us in the UN. Economically, before the trade friction started with them and
                    everything, we have a whole wide range of important relationships with the
                    Thai.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Somewhere along the line, I'm not sure when, I would say it was probably in the
                    late '60s or mid '60s, we began to start nudging the Thai on narcotics issues.
                    We continued to approach the Thai on taking narcotics more seriously as an
                    issue. The Thai never really took it too seriously as an issue because they
                    didn't really see it as their problem. They had other equities in narcotics
                    related issues and considerations which I'll explain. Mainly this is a period
                    when we are very good at paying lip service to beating up on the Thai about
                    narcotics: you've got to do more. The ambassador or the DCM would go in and make
                    a demarche. With sort of a wink and a nod everybody would go home, everyone
                    would be happy again and nothing would change. The reason was always that the
                    Thai are trying. Whether they tried or not I can't really say. I think many Thai
                    were trying but there were many things working against their efforts. Nothing
                    much got done and because of all of the intelligence cooperation, political
                    cooperation, economic cooperation and so on, we never really got on the Thai
                    case about it.</p>
                <p>The thing they were facing in all fairness, Thailand was not a major producing
                    country. Yes they did grow some opium. They still grow some opium, considerably
                    less than they used to. Through a long slow process of economic development in
                    the opium growing areas of northern Thailand, the opium crop was being reduced.
                    The opium farmers were being given alternatives. But the northern Thai border
                    with Burma was basically a wide open no-man's land. There was not much there.
                    Opium and heroin would come across into Thailand. If it was raw opium it was
                    refined in northern Thai heroin refineries, if it was heroin it was being
                    refined in Burma Shan State and coming in. Thailand was this great transit area
                    for most of the Burmese opium drug production in those years. Now it is China,
                    India, and other ways out, but in those years it was almost all through
                    Thailand.</p>
                <p>What we were trying to do was to get the Thai to interdict that stuff, do a
                    better job of interdicting it, but the Thai have this basic problem. One, they
                    didn't control their border and that was scary because north of the border up in
                    the Shan State there was a power vacuum and political chaos. There were maybe 30
                    armed insurgencies running around fighting the Burmese government, fighting each
                    other and they were all supporting themselves on the drug traffic. They all had
                    bases on the Thai side of the border which was their logistics area, their rear
                    area. The Thai were not strong enough basically, or did not want to commit the
                    resources because they had their own internal domestic insurgency and that sort
                    of thing. They did not want to stir up a hornets nest by trying to suppress
                    these armed groups along the border. Instead they took an approach, live and let
                    live. As long as you guys aren't messing around on the Thai side of the border,
                    you're behaving yourself on the Thai side of the border, what you do in Burma
                    we're not going to get involved in. Basically the Thai had very little choice.
                    They would have had to spend a whole lot of money, deferred a whole lot of army
                    and police resources, up into that area to bring it under control and even then
                    the Thai army was not noted for its fighting ability and there is no guarantee
                    they would be able to do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The biggest problem for everybody in this was the Kuomintang remnants that had
                    left Burma and had eventually ended up along the northern border. Long about
                    1970, the Thai and the KMT remnants sort of struck a deal and this is after the
                    Thai tried for nine years to get them out of the country. They tried to get
                    Taiwan to take them out. Taiwan was trying to get all these guys to come back to
                    Taiwan and disband and disarm. These guys didn't want to go to Taiwan, they
                    wanted to stay where they were. Negotiations dragged on for something like eight
                    years. Finally at the end of that the Thai and the Taiwanese quit talking to
                    each other and they gave up basically. The Thai had to deal directly with the
                    KMT remnants in their own country and they made a deal. We'll let you stay here
                    as refugees if you act as our security paramilitary forces along the border and
                    if you will go fight the Communist Party of Thailand insurgency in Chiang Rai
                    Province, which is in the north. That was the deal. So you have the KMT
                    patrolling and being the security force for the border, keeping all the smaller
                    drug trafficking and insurgency groups sort of in check and behaving themselves
                    on the Thai side of the border and running great drug caravans out of Burma.</p>
                <p>That was the problem we were up against with the Thai. We all knew this. We all
                    knew the Thai probably couldn't do much more than they were doing but we still
                    felt obligated to push the Thai to do more. We did that for years and years and
                    years. It was nothing new, it wasn't new policy. We sort of knew we weren't
                    going to get them to do everything we wanted but they were trying in their own
                    way. Eventually now they are doing a good job but it took a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '75 to '77 period, was this the period where
                        we were keeping up rather constant pressure with no great developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, basically. We kept providing assistance. We would provide
                    helicopters to the Thai police, and communications equipment. We would pay for
                    economic development projects in opium growing areas that of course has a
                    spin-off of hopefully providing the farmers with an alternative to opium
                    production. There would be a seizure now and then, a big seizure sometimes. You
                    always had the white ant problem in that you would have opium or heroin seized
                    and it would somehow disappear from the police storerooms which we usually
                    attributed to white ants eating it. White ants were a problem in Southeast Asia.
                    They eat wood, just about anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>There was nothing big. It was during this period that there were dedicated Thai
                    police in the office of Narcotics Control Board who were their equivalent of
                    perhaps the DEA. They were trying hard but drug related corruption in the Thai
                    police, to a lesser degree in the army, basically negated everything the good
                    guys were trying to do over there. DEA was there. They had a lot of people and
                    they worked very hard. Our intelligence people also addressed the drug issue and
                    tried to do some things there. Not a whole lot changed. We pressured, they gave
                    a little and tried a little harder when we pressed. The embassy basically served
                    as an apologist for the Thai because the Department was putting pressure on the
                    embassy to go put pressure on the Thai. The embassy would soak it all up and
                    then become the advocate of the Thai and it was not exactly built for
                    progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Charlie Whitehouse, an excellent man. He really is. And he was stuck. He
                    had so many issues at stake there including the draw-down of our military forces
                    out of the bases. Charlie didn't have any other choice, I don't think, but I bet
                    in his shoes I would do the same thing I am sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a rather crucial period in Southeast Asia, '75
                        when you arrived. By the time that you arrived South Vietnam had fallen. I
                        was wondering what about the repercussions both in Burma and in Thailand,
                        from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I don't think there were many in Burma that I can recall. It is really a
                    hermit country. In Thailand there were a lot of repercussions. By '75 we were
                    well into our draw-down. We weren't totally out of the country yet with our
                    military forces but we were fixing to be soon. There was the democracy movement.
                    The old military dictatorship in Thailand was gone and you had elected
                    governments. I think it was Kukrit Pramoj at the time. Kukrit was certainly not
                    going to be a lackey of the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the prime minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, I think it was Kukrit at the time. They were all concerned about
                    what's next. I mean here are the Americans, cut and run out of Southeast Asia.
                    The Thai have to make their peace with the Chinese and with their Indochina
                    neighbors because of their role in the war so there is this reorientation of
                    policy going on in Thailand and part of that is distancing themselves from us.
                    The thing that really put the cap on it was the, I can't remember the name of
                    that ship...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is the name of a port in Puerto Rico. It was a ship
                        that was seized by the Cambodians.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Right. The U.S. Marines staged a rescue operation of the Mayaguez out of
                    a Thai air base without the courtesy of letting the Thai government know we were
                    going to do it. That really pissed a lot of Thai off. Student radicalism was in
                    full swing and there was an awful lot of concern over pressure from the
                    students, the potential for riots and this sort of thing. We were sort of
                    walking on eggs with the Thai. But the Thai establishment of course, they were
                    trying to walk the middle line. They had such close relationship with us and had
                    worked with us so closely over so many years that they didn't really want to cut
                    us off and put us too far afield, but they did want to make their peace with the
                    Chinese and with the countries in Indochina. So it was a difficult time for the
                    Thai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel during this time when you were
                        working in dealing with Burma and Thailand that the North Vietnamese or the
                        Chinese were involved in the drug business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No. That is an old allegation that got its start with Harry J. Anslinger,
                    I think his middle initial was J. He was the federal narcotics commissioner in
                    the United States in the early '50s and a darling of the right wing, the China
                    lobby and the committee of one million or whatever the heck they were called. He
                    was the one who kept saying the Red Chinese are in the drug business. They are
                    exporting heroin, corrupting our youth, the youth of the west and this sort of
                    thing. It was all bull shit when Harry was saying it and the Chinese government
                    was never involved in anything like that. In fact their suppression of the drug
                    trade was quite draconian when they got power. Subsequently Anslinger's charges
                    were discredited.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese, I know nothing that would indicate they were in the drug business
                    at all. The Laotians were a slightly different story and that really comes a
                    little later. It comes in my next assignment. There were a lot of indications
                    that the Laotian army was shipping out opium into the international markets for
                    profit. Maybe personal profit, but maybe to buy stuff with too, it wasn't really
                    clear. The Vietnamese, I'd be really surprised if that were the case.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: To the new created INM. S/NM was replaced by a bureau and it was called
                    INM, International Narcotics Matters.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: From '77 to '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there sort of at the initiation of this new
                        bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a little about the organizational thing? I
                        try to capture a glimpse of how, when you set up a new organization you are
                        obviously taking things away from other bureaus and all of that. Any views
                        of that during the time that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: S/NM, Sheldon Vance's organization, had some clout in the Department but
                    it didn't really have a whole lot of clout. The geographic bureaus were dominant
                    of course. I guess when President Carter came in there was a feeling that the
                    narcotics issue was getting so important that there should be a full fledge
                    bureau so the narcotics bureau could stand up to the geographic bureaus and
                    demand that they take action. I guess there was some substance to that.</p>
                <p>Carter's drug advisor was Dr. Peter Boren, a British born psychologist who had
                    been close to Carter for years through the campaign and everything. He was a
                    real internationally recognized expert on drug abuse treatment and
                    rehabilitation type stuff. A good friend of Peter Boren's was a woman named
                    Mathea Falco who was young, something like 32 or 33 years old. She had had some
                    experience with narcotics treatment and rehabilitation stuff as well. When the
                    decision was made to establish the Bureau of International Narcotics Matters,
                    this woman Falco was selected to be the first assistant secretary of State.</p>
                <p>Building the bureau was interesting because, I'm not sure of the personality
                    dynamics, but basically Sheldon Vance retired and just left. I don't know if he
                    even met Mathea Falco. Perhaps they did but if they did there was no real
                    exchange of ideas and real help given for the formation of the new bureau. S/NM
                    was a very small office. They had an officer for each geographic area. They
                    didn't have much clout and they didn't really do much. They didn't have their
                    own EX or anything like that so we had to create all of this from whole cloth.
                    What Mathea Falco had to do was basically recruit people to come work for her
                    which was kind of interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I was one of the first people she had met because of my work on narcotics in
                    Southeast Asia. She got me to do the Southeast Asian thing and she got various
                    other people to do other things. They sent a guy named Joe Linneman from OMB
                    over as the deputy assistant secretary of State. He was responsible for putting
                    together the EX operation, the budgeting, the accounting and that sort of thing.
                    He brought over with him two of his colleagues from OMB and they became the core
                    of the EX. Basically Mathea Falco, me and a few of the people that she recruited
                    became the core of the policy side of the bureau. I handled all of the East Asia
                    stuff for that office and towards the end I became her special assistant and
                    played with policy papers, speech writing, testimony writing, that sort of
                    thing. As I recall the bureau was created basically through her own hard work
                    and through the hard work of Joe Linneman. They got very little support from the
                    established bureaucracy in the State Department, that I could see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds a bit parallel to Pat Darien in human
                        rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Exactly and Darien and Falco were buddies. I don't know where they knew
                    each other from, but they knew each other from before. Maybe it was from the
                    Carter campaign, or who knows. This went back to the human rights thing. With
                    Pat Darien there, and a Human Rights Bureau also, human rights began to take on
                    a lot more importance. We did then have to start dealing with human rights
                    issues concerning Burma.</p>
                <p>It's back to the thing of you're helping a military dictatorship. You are giving
                    them military equipment which they are going to use on ethnic freedom fighters,
                    insurgents, and that sort of a thing. Here again we tried to explain to Pat
                    Darien that these ethnic freedom fighters are not what you think they are, they
                    are not at all democratic. They are supporting themselves through drug
                    trafficking. In the beginning some of them were certainly ethnic insurgents when
                    they started, but over the years the drug trafficking basically corrupted their
                    objectives and their goals. Drugs became their raison d'�tre rather than
                    insurgency and independence for the Shan, or independence for the Lah, or
                    whoever. It wasn't really a human rights issue.</p>
                <p>I think, and this is just the impression that I got, because of the close
                    personal relationship between Mathea Falco and Pat Darien, Pat Darien pretty
                    much accepted our arguments. I think they were valid. We weren't trying to snow
                    anybody and we sincerely believed that, and I still believe that today. We
                    didn't really have much of a human rights hassle. Human rights hassle on the
                    narcotics program with Burma came much later, in the '80s I think, sometime
                    after I had gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the woman who got the Nobel Prize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Aung San Suu Kyu. Even before she became an item there were human rights
                    concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have interviewed Pat Darien and she was talking about
                        how she was having real problems being ignored by the geographic bureaus and
                        all of that. At least Pat Darien had the aura of having Jimmy Carter in her
                        hip pocket, which was not actually true, but she played this for all it was
                        worth, and rightly so. With Falco I would imagine that she wouldn't have
                        quite that clout.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: She did not, although she was a delightful charming person so she went
                    around charming everybody in the Department. This is the part I saw because I
                    was doing East Asia, but I think she had a fair amount of influence in East Asia
                    for a very simple reason, she owed her job to Peter Boren. The other person who
                    owed his job to Peter Boren in the Department was Richard Holbrooke. So Richard
                    Holbrooke being assistant secretary of State for East Asia, was amenable to
                    suggestion and pressure from Peter Boren which made the working relationship
                    between Mathea Falco and Richard Holbrooke a lot easier, I think as I recall,
                    than between Mathea and other geographic bureaus. I would say that. Pat Darien
                    and Mathea Falco both shared that sort of we're the black sheep of the family
                    type thing. They were like skunks at a garden party. Nobody wanted to have
                    anything to do with them because both human rights and narcotics screwed up your
                    traditional political, economic relationships with your client countries. That
                    was a problem throughout and I don't know if it is still a problem or not. I
                    think it still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect so. Although you had Southeast Asia, there were
                        two big areas and Latin America was the big one. What was your impression of
                        how things were going there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I thought things there were going pretty well. Linneman did a lot of that
                    work. He kept building this empire. Linneman is a fantastic empire builder. I
                    don't know where Joe is now, I think he is a consultant somewhere, but he was an
                    incredible empire builder. He could really get things done in the bureaucracy.
                    By the time I left, INM had its own air force: contractors, maintenance and
                    planes. They are still around. They are all over Latin America.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>In those years the big heroin threat was Mexico and so we had airplanes spraying.
                    I went down there and I observed them. I went out in the fields with them and
                    watched the helicopters spray poppy fields and that sort of thing. They were
                    spraying also marijuana and that was big paraquat debate. We were using paraquat
                    which is a pesticide that kills plants. All the marijuana smokers were all
                    pissed off at us because it left a residue which is, or could be, a carcinogen.
                    Here are all the marijuana smokers smoking their illegal product and then
                    complaining because the State Department is aiding and abetting the spraying of
                    a carcinogen on their crop. I just loved that one. We were all real sympathetic
                    about that. The cocaine thing then wasn't quite as big as it got. We already had
                    some guys down there working against cocaine. I thought relationships in Mexico
                    were pretty good. They deteriorated later. In those years I thought we had a
                    good relationship with the Mexicans. DEA guys were down there catching drugs and
                    that sort of thing. Most of the effort was the spraying down there that we were
                    involved in.</p>
                <p>We had liaison officers in the bureau from DEA, from U.S. Customs and from NIDA,
                    the National Institute for Drug Abuse. We had a drug abuse expert on loan to us
                    over there. We inherited from USAID the old public safety office. Public safety
                    had been discredited after the events down in Uruguay, Brazil and a few other
                    places and so by 1977 there were just a few of the OPS guys left around in AID.
                    It was a very small office and it was run by a woman named Mary Weller or Wells,
                    I can't remember her name. What we did, Mary fought it all the way, we
                    incorporated her office. We gobbled it up and brought it into INM also. I think
                    she retired or went off and did something else with AID. We got a lot of her
                    former cops and some of them were quite good. They became the core of our
                    aviation organization and this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Because Mathea Falco was pretty close to Peter Boren, she could draw on Peter
                    Boren's clout and he had enough clout to get to the president sometimes and so
                    we could get things done. Between her contacts with Peter Boren and Joe
                    Linneman's ability to work the system, we really created an empire. I think we
                    started off with something like four people in the office. By the time I left
                    two years later they must have had 30 or 40 people in there. I don't know what
                    the count was but we had a lot of people. (end side 1)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in your area was Dick Holbrooke favorably
                        inclined to Ms. Falco? How did you find our efforts in Laos, you mentioned
                        Laos got involved, but also with Thailand as far as getting the embassy to
                        give narcotics a higher priority?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Let's start with your last question. I don't think we had a whole lot
                    more success with the embassy then. I can't remember who the ambassador was. It
                    was sort of more of the same. We kept helping the Thai. They would make a
                    seizure. They would do this, and then that. There was steady slow progress on
                    the Thai part. But they continued to support, to allow, all of these drug
                    trafficking groups to have bases in northern Thailand and operate the drug
                    traffic in Burma. This continued to go on, and on, and on. We just couldn't get
                    them to stop that because of their perceived security interests, and resources,
                    and so on. That is a short answer to your last question. We didn't get much of
                    anything. Save the Laos one.</p>
                <p>The Holbrooke Falco relationship was interesting. That was the period when Khun
                    Sa, (at that time I think we used to call him Chang Chi Fu but maybe he had
                    already changed his name to Khun Sa by then) and the Shan United Army, his group
                    of trafficking thugs in Burma, came up with a proposal which I guess it had been
                    kicking around for a while really. Very early in '77, or in the summer of '77,
                    the pressure was building up. When did the new administration come in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: January of '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: That's right. I guess while I was on the desk we had pretty well stamped
                    down the idea of what we call a preemptive purchase. When the new administration
                    came in, it raised its ugly head again as a proposal and so it got a lot of
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A preemptive purchase being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: A preemptive purchase being the U.S. government will buy the Shan State
                    opium crop and destroy it and give the money to the traffickers. That keeps it
                    off the streets. The traffickers will use the money to develop the economic
                    livelihood of the people and to do what they have to do to help mankind in the
                    Shan State. Khun Sa, this was his big thing, and some others had come up with
                    this proposal before. There was some precedent because in 1973 or 1974 we did
                    that in Thailand. We paid the KMP a million dollars to come up with 26 tons of
                    it and burn it, and then they promised to behave themselves after that.</p>

                <p>This preemptive purchase deal came up again. I remember this fascinating
                    conversation I was a witness to. I and my fellow professional Foreign Service
                    officers had convinced Mathea Falco that the preemptive purchase was a bad idea.
                    It would not work. It would not work for a lot of reasons. One, you couldn't
                    trust Khun Sa, Chang Chi Fu, any farther than you could throw the guy. Secondly,
                    he did not control the lion share of the opium product in Burma. By that time
                    the Burma Communist Party controlled the lion share of the opium product. Khun
                    Sa may have done most of the refining but the raw opium wasn't his to sell. The
                    thought that anybody, the Burma Communist Party, Khun Sa or anybody else, could
                    come up with the whole opium crop was ridiculous. We reasoned that with the part
                    you didn't get, the profits would be fantastic. Let's say you could get off 30
                    percent, 40 percent of the crop even. For the remaining 76 percent, the price
                    just doubled. The other thing was that you'd be setting in a cultural support
                    system. You set a four plied price for opium so all the farmers next year are
                    not going to grow corn, they are going to grow opium. There are a whole lot of
                    problems with this thing. How is it going to work and this sort of thing. Mathea
                    Falco agreed it was a bad idea.</p>
                <p>Peter Boren over at the White House, is a little more exposed to the crazies out
                    there, the wild eyed idealists, or whoever, that is going to come pushing this
                    program. There were some guys on the hill like Congressman Lester Wolf who
                    thought it was a great idea also. There was a lot of pressure building again now
                    to reopen this thing. Mathea Falco went down to see Richard Holbrooke one day
                    and I was the flunky, the note taker. I was sitting there taking notes and
                    answering detailed questions if there are any, there weren't. Richard Holbrooke
                    said, and I am paraphrasing because I don't recall the exact words but the words
                    were something very much like this, “I owe my job to Peter Boren. Peter Boren
                    thinks that a preemptive purchase might be a good idea. Therefore I think a
                    preemptive purchase is a good idea. I will go along with what Peter Boren wants
                    to do.” In other words he told Mathea that basically he didn't see any problem
                    with preemptive purchase and he wasn't going to get out there and try to stop
                    it.</p>
                <p>I was astounded. I was still in those years an impressionable young Foreign
                    Service officer. I thought that my seniors in the system really had America's
                    interest at heart, not their own political interests at heart and this sort of
                    thing. To hear Holbrooke say this, was a tremendous eye opener to me. It really
                    opened my eyes. To me it just reeked of cynicism, self promotion, and all the
                    things which I thought we didn't do in the State Department back then. I
                    realized later we did it. Everyone was doing it. I just didn't know it. I was
                    just too naive. It was my own fault. But anyway, I thought that was a
                    fascinating conversation.</p>
                <p>Not long after that Mathea Falco, Peter Boren and I went out to Thailand and
                    Burma on a visit. On the airplane across the Pacific, Mathea and I cornered
                    Peter and talked his ear off for the whole trip telling him why it was a bad
                    idea. By the time we got to Thailand, Peter Boren had come around to being very
                    skeptical about it. Then subsequently of course, Richard Holbrooke became
                    skeptical about it. I just loved it. I will never forget that story. Anyway, I
                    paraphrased it and those aren't the exact words, but they are pretty darn
                    close.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The Laos thing comes up when on two different occasions I tagged along as the bag
                    carrier, the flunky, for the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs annual meetings in
                    '78 and '79. In those years they were in Geneva. Now they are in Vienna because
                    the organization subsequently moved to Vienna. We had sent a delegation. There
                    would be a couple congressmen on it. I guess Mathea Falco as the assistant
                    secretary of State was the head of the delegation both times. UNFDAC, the United
                    Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control, was a subordinate body to the Commission on
                    Narcotic Drugs which sort of did its program work, projects around the world and
                    those things. UNFDAC, as we called it, had now become the UNDCP, United Nations
                    International Drugs Control Project. In the acronym the “I” drops out to be the
                    UNDCP.</p>
                <p>One of those times, I think it was the '78 session, UNFDAC was planning a project
                    in Laos and they eventually went ahead with it. There was a particular mountain
                    autonomous region, or something like that I can't remember exactly, where the
                    army continued to have direct control, not the government. This was for security
                    reasons because this was the Muong area and there was still concern over counter
                    revolutionaries and that sort of thing. We had back in Washington here access to
                    all kinds of intelligence indicating that the Lao army in this area was engaged
                    in harvesting the opium crop or buying up the opium crop which the Muong
                    harvested, and shipping it out to other places, via Vietnam by the way. They
                    were doing this according to these reports. I don't know if any of this is true
                    but they are unevaluated intelligence reports, I believe it is what they say
                    right across the top of them. We also got it from DEA reporting, so both DEA and
                    CIA reporting. The feeling amongst the law enforcement side of the house was
                    that they were doing this as a matter of supplementing the national budget. It
                    could have been. It could have been that they were doing it simply to line their
                    own pockets, their Swiss bank accounts. Who knows why.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I remember accompanying Ms. Falco when she went to see the head people in
                    UNFDAC to lobby against this project on the basis that the Lao were trafficking.
                    She shared with them some of the intelligence. Naturally it was carefully
                    sanitized and that sort of thing. It was all oral, there was nothing in writing.
                    She said that the U.S. government has real concerns over this because here you
                    are going to put money, some of which will be USG money, into a project to help
                    the Lao on the grounds that they are trying to suppress opium trafficking but
                    yet an arm of the government is engaged in opium trafficking. We had a problem
                    with this. There was a gentlemanly discussion at the office at the UN. Everyone
                    agreed to disagree. UNFDAC went ahead with its project. So this was what had
                    fired up my memory of Laos, was the question of were any of these guys, as a
                    government policy, trafficking in drugs? I don't know if the Lao were or not but
                    that was an event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Granted we are pulling out but god knows we had put in a
                        great deal of effort over the decade before or so, into developing sources,
                        intelligence, and all, in that whole Southeast Asia area designed for our
                        war in Vietnam. Did you find that we were getting pretty good intelligence
                        out of there or did that apparatus work for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>GIBSON: That is an interesting question and I am not smart enough to give you a
                    good answer. I just don't know. I can give you a couple of impressions that I
                    have. We're talking narcotics. Eventually I am in Bangkok as a political officer
                    and I can talk to you about the intelligence product in the mid '80s, early
                    '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about this period here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I didn't think it was very good, what I saw. The problem is this, DEA has
                    snitches all over the place, confidential informants or whatever they call them.
                    We used to call them snitches. These guys are feeding all kinds of information
                    into the intelligence collection system of DEA. You have to remember that DEA is
                    an agency dominated by the enforcement people. The guys that run that place are
                    the guys who go out and make arrests, do the undercover work, bust the big guys
                    and get the powder on the table. Those are the guys who run that place. The
                    intelligence guys in DEA are really the orphans of the organization. They get no
                    respect basically. There are some very good ones in there and they really
                    understand what is going on. These guys are getting a constant flow of
                    information some of which is good and some of which is bull shit and it is
                    really hard to sort out what. The problem is this information never gets out
                    because it is judicial related quite often. DEA basically tries to hide all of
                    this stuff saying it's all case related and it may become used in a
                    prosecutorial process at some point and therefore we can't share it with you. I
                    didn't see very much DEA stuff then. Later I saw some only because of personal
                    contacts, they let me peek at them.</p>
                <p>The only intelligence I saw really was the CIA stuff, the unevaluated
                    intelligence report and an occasional INR analytical report based upon both
                    State Department and CIA reporting, and other things. Basically the CIA
                    intelligence was not timely in the sense (and this was DEA's big complaint with
                    it) that it didn't help anybody make an arrest or follow a case. That being
                    said, it gave little anecdotes of the way the drug trafficking stuff was going
                    on. It was interesting. Not particularly good, not particularly useful, but
                    interesting and helpful in some ways. Not from an enforcement standpoint but
                    from an overall understanding of what was going on and how the system worked. It
                    wasn't bad. Earlier I said it wasn't good. I take it back. It was good, it was
                    good for that. Are these things ever classified?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Why don't you put it in and take a look at it. Put it
                        in. You will get this as a draft. Take a look and you can put it any way you
                        want. I think it is better to put more in than not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>GIBSON: In that period we had the capability, and they probably knew that we were
                    doing it, of monitoring communications between some of the trafficking groups.
                    We could follow their caravans because they were on the radio to one another.
                    These were big caravans with something like 200 or 300 mules and horses, a
                    couple hundred armed guards and they are moving, they are gathering stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your friend and mine Clyde McAvoy said that they used to
                        put the homers in those saddles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I don't know about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that he said that one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: What we could also do was monitor the radio communication. As I
                    understand it, the Chinese were pretty slick, the KMT guys, because they had
                    guys being trained in Taiwan. They had codes and they were really tough ones to
                    break. But a lot of the other ones we could track their caravans as they came
                    down and then we would tell the Burmese army where they were. They would take
                    those helicopters, ideally, and go get them. It is easier said than done because
                    the terrain is terrible up there. I think eventually the traffickers got wise
                    and they would have guys over here sending false radio signals and that sort of
                    thing. We were doing all of that sort of thing and that is part of the
                    intelligence collection effort. That, I thought, was a pretty good effort. I had
                    some friends who were doing that and that seemed to be useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '79 you left INM and where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I spent a year trying to learn Thai. No, wait a minute, while waiting for
                    the class to open, I did four months in the Board of Examiners. I had a
                    ball.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the candidates who were coming
                        through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Good. I thought they were good candidates. I did four months. It was from
                    late spring to late summer or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were candidates that would be Foreign Service
                        officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Right. I remember an interesting thing and it may have been generational,
                    it may have been background. What are those personality profile tests that we
                    all take? I have taken them so many times I can skew them to be whatever I want
                    to be. Well the ones that they give all the State Department guys, I come out
                    all the time that my profile fits five percent of Foreign Service officers but
                    fits like 90 percent of military officers. That is my profile. I am that kind of
                    a guy. I am a westerner, poor background, just kind of laid back kind of guy. I
                    am in the Board of Examiners with all these guys who are the thoughtful,
                    reflective, typical Foreign Service officer profile from Harvard or Yale. Back
                    in those years it was still mainly the prestige schools. I am on these panels
                    with these guys and the thing I remember is that the people coming through, men
                    and women, who I wanted to hire, (I was given the oral exam, I had nothing to do
                    with the written exam) these guys were all dismissing as cowboys, especially
                    when we got out west. I'd take a couple of trips to L.A. and one to Denver. Some
                    of the people that I thought would be fascinating to have in the Foreign
                    Service, these guys were just dead set against. I was the junior guy and so I
                    lost every argument but I remember that interesting conflict. Even so, I thought
                    we were bringing in some pretty good people.</p>
                <p>I remember I fought them on a couple of times. There was this woman in Denver
                    that I wanted to hire. Her father had died and she had taken over the running of
                    a ranch. She managed the ranch. She did the books, the crew and everybody and
                    she managed to go to a good school. She had a good degree, high GPA. Now her
                    brothers were taking over the ranch and she was going to leave and do something
                    else. A cowgirl. She wouldn't make it in the Foreign Service. I bet she would
                    have. She was a terrific person. Another one out in California, the guy was a
                    wine maker. He was the wine maker for Zaca Mesa Winery in California and a
                    graduate of California Davis, UC Davis, in wine making, oenology, or whatever it
                    is called. The guy was fantastic. But no, we don't need wine makers in the
                    Foreign Service, this sort of an attitude. Anyway, I thought we were bringing in
                    pretty good people.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>That was also an interesting period though. I had some interesting experiences
                    there because I would also occasionally be called upon to be a part of a three
                    person panel that would evaluate minority hires who had been brought in under a
                    system which doesn't exist any more. They had been brought in outside the exam
                    system entirely on a five year probationary thing. Frankly the screening wasn't
                    very good. I am sure that some of them turned out to be very good officers. Many
                    of them were not successful. At the end of the five years, their progress would
                    have to be reviewed. I remember sitting in on some of those panels. You would
                    look at some of the personal statements from some of the people as to why I want
                    to be a Foreign Service officer five years after I have been employed. Some of
                    them were fine and we approved them. Others had bad files. Their rating officers
                    had not thought highly of their work. Their own personal statements were filled
                    with typos and misspellings, grammatical mistakes, things like that. It was
                    really interesting. My colleagues and I, our impression was we felt really sorry
                    for these people because the State Department screwed them. The State Department
                    went out and grabbed these people who weren't going to make it. They should have
                    realized that they were not going to make it in the system. They sort of chummed
                    them on, led them down the road and five years later put the ax to them. It was
                    a bad system. I'm glad they got rid of it.</p>

                        this. It was poorly done and it was really one of these things that was
                        designed to be done in a hurry to make it look like we were really
                        responding to a definite need and that was to bring in more minorities,
                        particularly blacks.</hi>

                <p>You took Thai really sort of from '79 to '80?</p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, I took it at FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this? You are giving me sort of a

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>GIBSON: How about root canal with no anesthetic? I am not very good at languages
                    and it was for me like pulling teeth. Not only that, and this is an interesting
                    thing, apparently up until the year before I started they had a method of
                    teaching Thai at FSI which stressed the tones because after all it is a tonal
                    language. It's got five tones and if you botch a tone, no telling what you are
                    going to be saying. You are going to make a complete fool and entertain the
                    local people you're talking to. They used to teach it with a transliteration
                    into English characters with all the little accent marks and this sort of thing.
                    The people who took it under the old way, really had good pronunciation and good
                    tones but they found that they were having trouble reading because they weren't
                    exposed to the script until well into the course.</p>
                <p>What they did with the group that I was in, right from day one we were dealing
                    with the script. We did almost no work on tones and they de-emphasized the
                    sitting at the booth listening and repeating with the tapes. They de-emphasized
                    all of that and it was much less structured. You'd sort of sit around in class
                    and you would just sort of say what you think you want to say and you don't do
                    drills and this sort of thing. If you put Thai in an unstructured situation
                    they're not going to do anything because they are just laid back folks. It was
                    all very pleasant. We all had a good time but none of us learned anything. Some
                    of them did. There were some success stories out of the class. Eventually FSI
                    went back to the old way of doing things.</p>
                <p>I can remember when I got to Thailand people saying to me, you know all the
                    words. I had a massive vocabulary. My friends who had taken Thai under the old
                    way, they would say to them you speak Thai clearly, meaning you have the tones
                    down. Whereas my group came through and we had this huge vocabulary and we could
                    read fairly well but our pronunciation wasn't much. We had a lot of catch-up
                    work to do once we got to the country. I am not very good anyway and even if
                    they had done it the tonal way I probably still would have screwed them up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Thailand from 1980 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: In the summer of 1980 I went to Songkhla which is in south Thailand. It
                    was a small consulate in south Thailand. In '82 I moved up to the embassy in
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '82 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: From '82 to '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Songkhla. Could you describe in 1980 what
                        the place was like and then we'll go on to your work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Songkhla is on the Gulf of Thailand and it borders on Malaysia. It is a
                    small port which has been expanded since I was there. At the time it was a small
                    fishing port. I don't remember how big the town was but it wasn't very big at
                    all. There were very few westerners living there. It's about a 30 or 40
                    kilometer drive from a place called Hat Yai which was, and is, the economic
                    commercial center of that part of Thailand. Hat Yai is connected by road and
                    railway to Malaysia. Songkhla was a delightful place, sleepy, laid back little
                    place. The consulate was quite small. There was me, an American PIT locally
                    hired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A PIT is a part-time intermittent temporary, part-time
                        employee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: 39 hours a week job. There were about half a dozen State Department
                    employees. There were three Thai employees of USIA/USIS so I was concurrently
                    the branch public affairs officer as well as being a consul. There was a DEA
                    office around the corner from me that had three agents, one American secretary
                    and various Thai employees. Our communications was done by radio. We would
                    transmit telegraphically. We would punch tapes and then send it by radio to the
                    embassy in Bangkok. The guy that ran the communications force was a Thai air
                    force major on loan from the Thai military, a hold-over from the old days when
                    we were working very close with the Thai in the south on insurgency issues and
                    that sort of thing. It was a sleepy, very pleasant place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we have a consulate in a sleepy, pleasant place
                        down in southern Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: To provide Dick Gibson with a nice assignment. The history of the thing
                    was it was a holdover from winning the hearts and minds during the insurgency
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the communists in mainly
                        Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>GIBSON: No. There were three insurgencies in the south when I was there. You had
                    the remnants of the Malaysian Communist Party insurgency which was pretty much
                    dying out. They had a few guys and they were all holed up on the Thai side of
                    the border. The Thai, like in the north, weren't doing much about it. They
                    weren't bothering the Thai. Then there were various groups of Muslim separatists
                    which were often confused for bandits. There wasn't much difference. Then there
                    were remnants of the Communist Party of Thailand because while the Communist
                    Party of Thailand in the north and the northeast was almost defunct by 1980,
                    1981, 1982, (they were really on hard times) the ones in the south were
                    flourishing because the root causes of the communist insurgency in Thailand were
                    addressed in the south more slowly than they were addressed elsewhere: official
                    corruption, official bullying of the people and that sort of thing, mistreatment
                    of the poor folks. There was this big collection of them and they were all on
                    the wane when I was there. At one time the communist insurgency down there had
                    been really big.</p>
                <p>Songkhla originally was a branch public affairs office of USIS going out and
                    showing films without psychological warfare, so it went out with the Thai and
                    that sort of thing. Eventually it became a consulate. I'm not sure when, but I
                    think it was in the early '70s. When I was there the justification for having it
                    was we're just finishing up the insurgency and that sort of got wrapped up while
                    I was still there. I remember going to see some of the big victories. After a
                    big victory my Thai army buddies would take me up there. We would tour the area,
                    they would show me all the captured weapons and all this stuff. It was all kind
                    of fun.</p>
                <p>More importantly, that was a period with all the boat people from Vietnam coming
                    over to south Thailand. Malaysia and south Thailand is where they would make
                    shore. There was a UNHCR, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, run
                    refugee camp at Songkhla just south of town on the beach for the Vietnamese.
                    There was a massive piracy problem going on there. The Thai fishermen were doing
                    all kinds of really bad things out there on the water to the Vietnamese boat
                    people. We then started an anti-piracy program down there. It turned out that
                    while I did a lot of reporting on the dying insurgency, the most important part
                    of my work while I was there was looking after the protection and welfare of
                    these refugees. That is why we still had a place there. We have since closed
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about the boat people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>GIBSON: It was an interesting thing. I had a philosophical problem with the
                    refugee situation. These people, and you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to
                    be around them a bit, were not political refugees by and large. I'll tell you
                    about a survey that I did on that. It was clear that they were economic migrants
                    just jumping to the head of the cue by coming across by boat. I had real
                    philosophical differences with that which got me cross waves with Mort
                    Abramowitz, the ambassador up in Bangkok, who was very sympathetic to the
                    refugees. I am sympathetic to their problems. I am very sympathetic to the
                    things that were happening to them on the water. In fact I was one of the big
                    supporters, pushers, and activists in the anti-piracy program to make the Thai
                    fishermen stop what they were doing to the boat people. I also had real problems
                    with this idea that these were all political refugees and we should all put them
                    on the next big bird to Orange County.</p>
                <p>To give you an example, at some point during my time there my PIT assistant and
                    I, working with the UNHCR guy, a Frenchmen Alan Foley, a great guy, used UNHCR
                    boat arrival records and we would take boats as they would come in. We would
                    select them. Some boats would come from say the Delta area and others would come
                    from somewhere else in the south. They would sort of represent this group of
                    geographical regions from where they set out from quite often. Not entire so,
                    but generally. We selected boats that were largely ethnic Chinese and largely
                    ethnic Vietnamese. They were all Vietnamese of course but Sino-Vietnamese versus
                    Vietnamese. We would then select off the registers people by age, by sex, to try
                    to get representative samples. We did extensive surveying with interpreters and
                    looking at the record what they had told the interpreters and everything to try
                    to determine why they are coming. It was clear that probably ten to 15 percent
                    could qualify as political refugees. Probably another ten percent were sort of
                    marginal, pretty hard to tell. The rest were clearly economic migrants or young
                    people dodging the draft or auto mechanics, seamstresses, wanting to immigrate
                    for the same reasons our ancestors wanted to emigrate from wherever they
                    immigrated from. But they weren't political refugees.</p>
                <p>I wrote all this up, outlined the methodology and everything. In those days we
                    sent everything up to the embassy and then the embassy transmitted it to
                    Washington. I sent it up by pouch. Before I sent it up by pouch, somebody from
                    the refugee department came to visit. There were two of them that came to visit
                    me and I get them confused. One was Ship Lowman who was a DAS, I think, in the
                    refugee bureau. I can't remember the other guy's name. I think it was Ship
                    Lowman who came to see me and I explained to him what I was doing. He was
                    checking on refugees doing his thing and I told him about all of this. He looked
                    at me and said, “Well, that's not policy.” And I said, “What do you mean that's
                    not policy? Policy, you want reporting right?” He said, “No, but our policy is
                    that these people are political refugees. If I were you I would not send that
                    report.”</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>I am stubborn. The minute somebody tells me not to do something, okay, I'm going
                    to do it. I just sat there and I was stunned. Basically here is a senior officer
                    from the Department telling me that I can't report something that is going on
                    because it is not consistent with policy. It's the emperor's new clothes, that
                    type of thing. The minute he left, I called the DCM, Burt Levin. He's a
                    wonderful guy. I just think the world of Burt. I said, “Burt, here's what
                    happened.” He says “You send that report.” I sent it up. It sat and sat in the
                    embassy. They didn't know what to do with it because they didn't want to send it
                    in. Burt didn't have any problem sending it in. It's reporting. It doesn't mean
                    it is true, as I later said.</p>
                <p>It was all up there and what was going on was somebody in the refugee section
                    called the Far Eastern Economic Review and told John McBeth about this. At the
                    time, the Far Eastern Economic Review was carrying a big piece on the refugee
                    issue and one of the simple figures in it was from an American USAID officer in
                    Singapore who basically had sent a report saying the same thing that I was
                    saying and got creamed for it. His career was finished. He found out that my
                    report was saying basically the same thing. I didn't even know this guy, there
                    was no collusion. It was just what was going on. McBeth wrote a little squib
                    from Bangkok after the story telling that the consulate in Songkhla had sent
                    this report up saying something along the same line but it had been spiked by
                    the embassy and it wasn't being sent out. Of course the ambassador and the head
                    of the refugee operation at the time, Lionel Rosenblatt, had thought I had done
                    it. I didn't call McBeth. I got to know McBeth later and we got to be good
                    friends. Every now and then over a couple of beers I would ask him “John, who
                    the hell told you about that.” He'd say, “I can't tell you.”</p>
                <p>What they eventually did was Rosenblatt rewrote key parts of the cable and
                    changed basic conclusions to tone it way down and distort the facts and
                    editorialize and everything. They sent it in with my name at the bottom. I knew
                    I was in trouble but I'm stuck with it. I sent a cable up to the ambassador
                    saying Mr. Ambassador there seems to have been a mistake here because the cable
                    that went out under my name wasn't the same as the one I had written and here
                    are the differences. He basically sent me a short gram back telling me to shut
                    up and that he is the ambassador and has the right to send out any cable that he
                    wants, which I never argued a bit. My position was that they could have done a
                    lot of things to that cable: tore it up, use it for toilet paper, forgotten
                    about it, sent it as was, or sent it as was with a note or comment from the
                    embassy saying Gibson has been in the jungle too long and he's lost all touch
                    with reality and he's full of shit. Any of these options would have been fine
                    with me but to change the basic conclusions and to leave my name in the text as
                    though I had written those conclusions really ticked me off.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>GIBSON: It was certainly improper, if not illegal. As the ambassador I imagine he
                    has the legal right to do whatever he wants and I never questioned that. Anyway,
                    they were really going after me. Then they thought that I must have been the guy
                    that leaked it to McBeth. Burt, bless his heart, phoned me on the phone and he
                    said, “Dick, I'm asking you, did you leak it?” I said, “No.” “Do you know who
                    did?” “No.” If I knew I wouldn't have told him anyway but I didn't know and I
                    still don't know to this day. I have a suspect who denies it. So Burt ran
                    interference for me and meanwhile Abramowitz transferred. By the time that I got
                    up to the embassy in Bangkok Abramowitz was gone. To Mort's credit, while I was
                    in the political section in Bangkok about a year-and-a-half later and he was
                    with ISA over at the Pentagon, he came through on something. I met him and he
                    was totally gracious to me. No hard feeling held or anything like that, but boy
                    I was angry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't blame you. Let's say that distorts the ethics of

                <p>GIBSON: The reason I bring that episode up was to show that the refugee business,
                    I mean business because all these various organizations getting grants from the
                    federal government, it had become a growth business. People like Lionel
                    Rosenblatt who I'm sure is very well meaning...</p>

                <p>GIBSON: I'm sure he was doing what he thought was right. It shows that we had
                    just lost touch with reality in our refugee program which I thought was too
                    bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape three, side one with Dick Gibson. You were

                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>GIBSON: I would like to talk about the anti-piracy program. Let's do the
                    anti-piracy program and then pack it in for the day. Because of the piracy
                    problem down there where, I'm sure everyone who has read the papers know all the
                    horror stories that have been going on and I don't think they were exaggerated.
                    There were really terrible things happening there. I used to go up and down the
                    Gulf of Thailand coast in the south tracking down stories, talking to officials,
                    and talking to fishermen. The fishermen were really a hostile crowd. They
                    weren't interested in talking to me at all. I would talk to officials and
                    everything and they were all in to denial and minimizing. But you would
                    occasionally find a Thai official who would sort of level with you as to what
                    was going on. I was sending in all these reports. This was what was so funny
                    because of this stink over the refugee cable that I described. I was getting
                    attaboys from the Department refugee people all the time because I was
                    describing these atrocities. At one point I had heard about a boat full of
                    refugees being machine gunned, and then I found the boat on the beach with
                    bullet holes all through it and this sort of stuff. I kept getting these
                    attaboys. Then all of a sudden, one ah shit cancels out a hundred attaboys. It
                    was one of those kind of deals. Anyway, it really was a problem.</p>
                <p>When I was down there the embassy negotiated (all the negotiating was done up in
                    the embassy, I wasn't a part of that) to establish an anti-piracy program where
                    we would cooperate with the Thai navy. We would pay them basically to stage
                    anti-piracy patrols out of their naval base at Songkhla. They have a little
                    naval base there run by an admiral who is a great guy and we got to be close
                    friends. As part of this program we gave them two O-2 airplanes. An O-2 is a
                    push-pull, made by Cessna. I forget the civilian name for it, it is not an O-2.
                    An O-2 is a military term. We used them in Vietnam as an airport control
                    aircraft a lot. It had a propeller in the nose and one in the tail with a twin
                    broom thing that pushes, push-pull. Anyway, we turned over two of these in
                    Songkhla to go out to patrol for refugees in distress and to look for things
                    going on that shouldn't be going on. We gave them a 95 foot refurbished former
                    U.S. Coast Guard cutter which we sort of overhauled and sent across the Pacific
                    to them. I think it was UNHCR that got into the act also and provided them with
                    about a 50 or 60 foot patrol boat. It was a fast patrol boat with guns on it and
                    stuff like that.</p>
                <p>The first admiral down there, Wattana Pom, really seemed sincere and interested
                    in chasing down the pirates unlike most of the cops around there, they didn't
                    much care. They don't like Vietnamese anyway. The Thai don't care much for the
                    Vietnamese. He was pretty good. He did some innovation. He developed the idea of
                    the old Q boat concept from World War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fake freighters which submarines would surface to capture
                        and then the sides would fall away and they would shoot at them. The British
                        used these.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Wattana Pom came up with the idea on his own. I would like to take credit
                    for it but I couldn't. He got a couple of refugee boats, because there were
                    plenty of them around that had beached and left or had been towed in by the Thai
                    navy, he got them all painted up and they sort of looked like real boats. He had
                    a bunch of his guys in something like pajamas or funny hats looking like
                    Vietnamese. They would go out and patrol for pirates. In the first couple of
                    months, they got a bunch of them. There were a couple of shoot-outs. Of course
                    all of the sailors on board had M-16s and so there were shoot-outs there. They
                    made some arrests. That lasted about two or three months then by that time all
                    up and down the coast the grapevine had identified the Q boats and their
                    characteristics and where they were going to patrol and that sort of thing so it
                    didn't do much after that. It showed a lot of initiative on his part.</p>
                <p>The use of the patrol boats just astounded me, their non-use. They had the speed
                    boat, the one from UNHCR. It would go out and cruise around. I don't think they
                    ever caught anybody. The 95 foot Coast Guard cutter, you had some real potential
                    there because that is a ship. It has some good sea keeping capabilities and you
                    can go out and stay on it for a few days. That ship would go out and come in.
                    They would never spend the night at sea. I said to the admiral one day, “If you
                    take this Coast Guard cutter and you send it out for say like a weeks patrol and
                    they cruise up and down in the Gulf there and you get way out there, you are
                    liable to see some interesting stuff.” He looked at me and said “Overnight? The
                    men would have to be away from their families? The seas get rough at night and
                    it is a little more dangerous out there.” He just couldn't see how that would
                    make any difference. I said, “How do you think that that boat got from the
                    United States to Thailand? No one put it on an airplane. It came all the way
                    across the Pacific. That ship, the 95 footer, is perfectly capable of patrolling
                    in the Gulf of Thailand for a whole long time.” He just couldn't see to do that.
                    He was a little embarrassed about it so it may have been his orders from above,
                    they weren't going to give him the budget or whatever it was I don't know. But
                    it was real funny because that ship never really got used to its full potential.
                    Then he left after the first year. He left and was replaced by some guy whose
                    name I can't remember who didn't have any interest in the program at all. When I
                    left, there wasn't much left of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the insurgency down there, did we play any part
                        in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Not to my knowledge. I was reporting on it and tracking it but not many
                    people were really interested in the insurgency down there. By that time
                    obviously the Thai were going to win and the insurgencies were a nuisance but
                    not any kind of a threat to the body politic in Thailand. I used to follow it
                    because I like that sort of thing and because I had a lot of buddies in the Thai
                    army down there. We would go out. I got a kick out of it. I followed it and
                    probably most people didn't read what I sent up about it. They weren't that
                    interested in it. As I said, there were three insurgencies: the Muslim
                    separatist group, the Communist Party in Malaya, and the Communist Party in
                    Thailand. They were all around.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>There were a lot of places we couldn't go at that time. Brigandage, banditry,
                    roadagitry, whatever you might call it, was a real problem down there. A lot of
                    places, even the main highways, you didn't want to drive on at night because of
                    the chance of being hit by a road block of guys with M-16s wearing military
                    uniforms. They were called paramilitary rangers that the Thai used a lot against
                    the insurgency made up of local thugs rounded up out of the villages, unemployed
                    youth and this sort of stuff. It was sort of like the old days when juvenile boy
                    teenagers got in trouble in the States, you could do a year in the boys home or
                    you could go into the army. Oh, I think I'll go into the army. That's the kind
                    of guys they were. They would moonlight by holding up trains. The train from
                    Bangkok to Hat Yai was frequently being held up. It got so bad that while I was
                    down there, there were police units riding the train to protect against being
                    held up by train bandits. The general feeling was a lot of the bandits were
                    these paramilitary guys because they had M-16s and they would be in fatigues and
                    stuff. They would claim to be insurgents of this group or that group. Security
                    was sort of bad.</p>
                <p>I got several death threats, a couple of them by name. This was during the period
                    when our guys were in Iran, the hostages were there. In the south of Thailand
                    there are a lot of Muslims and so Muslim groups would occasionally send me death
                    threats. A couple times I sent my family up to Chiang Mai for three weeks, a
                    month one time because I got this note one time saying they were going to kill
                    my family first and then they were going to kill me. When they were generic
                    addressed to the consul, I didn't pay much attention, but these were addressed
                    to Mr. Gibson and so I took them a little more seriously. It was interesting. I
                    did not drive my official car on trips. When I wanted to go out I'd drive my
                    personal car and I had fake plates so that they wouldn't be blue and they
                    wouldn't show up. I'd put them on and just drive my car. I had a little Nissan
                    that I drove around. There were some bad areas.</p>
                <p>I remember visiting one time the governor of Prang Province. The month before I
                    visited him, he had been out in an area just out of town where there used to be
                    a special forces training camp where U.S. special forces used to work for the
                    Thai and now the Thai were doing it by themselves. Out in that area, he got
                    ambushed. This was like a month before I got there. He wanted to show me the
                    place but he didn't want to go in his own car so we got in a Cadillac Gage V150
                    armored car and we rode out. He wanted to show me where he was ambushed. The
                    communists were still messing around. These were Communist Party of Thailand who
                    did this. Then just before I left in the spring of '82 there was a big communist
                    base area left in Surat Thani Province and the Thai went in there and cleaned
                    them out. That was sort of one of the final big campaigns in the south and it
                    pretty much broke the back of what was left of the communists. They weren't much
                    of a threat, they were just a nuisance. It kept you from driving around.</p>

                <p>Today is the 23rd of April 1998. You were in Bangkok from '82 until when?</p>
                <p>GIBSON: 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I was in the political section. The political section was divided into
                    two units, an external unit and an internal unit. I was chief of the internal
                    unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: John Gunter Dean. I am trying to think if he was already there when I got
                    up, or if he was en route. I think he was already there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him as an ambassador? How did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I am one of those who liked John Gunter Dean and have a great deal of
                    respect for the man. It seems like people either really like John Gunter Dean or
                    really dislike him. I think he was an extremely effective ambassador. Why was he
                    an extremely effective ambassador? He had a very good ability to identify the
                    people in the Thai government that he had to know and work with. He was able to
                    cultivate them. He is a consummate bureaucrat in the sense that he knew where
                    the centers of powers were and what buttons had to be pushed to get things done.
                    He also at least projected a rather patrician air which I think helped him in
                    getting in close with the royal family. He was very close with the royal family
                    in Thailand. He was constantly on the go. I've never seen anyone put in the
                    hours that that man did. There was not an evening that he did not go to at least
                    one, but it was usually two or three different functions. He was very visible in
                    the capital city. He also liked to get out to the countryside so he really got
                    around. I think he really had a sense for the power structure in Thailand and
                    how things worked, at least in the capital. The problems with the ambassadors,
                    and it has always been this way in Thailand, is they get out in the countryside
                    but that doesn't mean they can understand how the countryside works. It means
                    that they have had a program set up by the consul and this sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>He ran his embassy as a pretty tight ship. He seemed to have a very thorough
                    grasp of everything that was going on within the embassy. Aside from that, I
                    guess maybe these are things that helped him, his ego was out of sight. I mean
                    the man has a degree of self confidence which quite frankly in my mind I don't
                    think anyone should have. But here again this helped him in his work. He
                    understood very well that he was representing the most powerful nation on earth
                    and he was not afraid to play that part. He was a bully to the people in the
                    embassy. If you got on John Gunter Dean's list you were in a hurt locker because
                    he treated you like dirt. On the other hand if he liked you, if he respected
                    you, or if you stood up to him I found that all of sudden his whole attitude
                    changed.</p>
                <p>I still recall a time when the political counselor had been gone for three or
                    four weeks with back trouble and I was acting chief of the section. We had a big
                    hall, a common area, and we all had offices off the common area. My office was
                    way in the back because I liked it way in the back and out of the way. The
                    ambassador's office back door was right around the corner. He came in one
                    afternoon and grabbed some poor soul who had done something which displeased
                    him. He just began to berate this poor officer, just thumping all over him. I
                    heard all the commotion and came out. I went up to him and looked him in the eye
                    and said “Mr. Ambassador what he did is what he was told to do. I am the one who
                    told him to do that because I thought those were the instructions from the front
                    office. It is me that screwed up and it's me that you have a problem with.” He
                    just sort of looked at me. It just took all the wind out of him and he sort of
                    harrumphed a little bit and walked away. I thought, oh god, I'm dead now. Just
                    forget it, I'll be on the next flight home. It had a tremendously positive
                    effect on our relationship. After that he would call me into his office. Here's
                    how he operated, everything back channel. If you read the front channel traffic
                    from Ambassador Dean you didn't have a clue as to what was going on. It was all
                    just basically reporting stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He sounds like Graham Martin in a way, out of the same
                        school.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>GIBSON: I don't know him. I know who Graham Martin was but I never met the man.
                    He would then call me in for his back channel stuff. He was either a terrible
                    drafter or he didn't care because he always had flunkies around like me, for
                    example, to clean them up. What he would do, he would dictate back channel stuff
                    to his secretary. His secretary would give him double spaced text. He would call
                    me in, not on a daily basis but once a week or so, and he would say, “Dick, take
                    this and sit down over there and clean it up a little bit. It is something I
                    dashed off to the secretary.” I would go sit at sort of a meeting table in his
                    office. I would sit down. He'd say “No pride about it do whatever to clean it
                    up.” I would think, what a mess. I'd start marking it all up, clean it all up
                    and give it to him. He'd say “Thanks.” I think what he said now was, “This is
                    between you and me. Don't even tell your section chief that you are doing this.”
                    Yeah, right. I went to see my section chief and I said this is what is going on.
                    I am sworn to secrecy on the text of what I am doing because obviously he
                    doesn't want anyone else to see it. But I'll tell you what, if I ever see
                    anything that affects you personally or anything that affects something that
                    we're very much working on and it's going to screw everything all up, I'll let
                    you know. My boss, what's he going to say. It really paid off because if you got
                    on John Gunter Dean's bad side you were in trouble.</p>
                <p>There was one point in my time there with him, the editor of The Nation
                    newspaper, a man named Suittoo Chai Yuan, I still remember his name and he is
                    still the editor that's why I remember, wanted to meet with me. He's a Thai
                    fellow. The Nation is an English language newspaper in Bangkok. Suittoo Chai
                    Yuan has a degree from one of the Ivy League schools. The Nation is actually
                    quite good and he's quite a nice fellow. At the time, the Thai were negotiating
                    with the Americans to buy their first lot of F-16s which frankly they needed
                    like we needed another hole in the head. They wanted prestige.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in case they were challenged by the Burmese air
                        force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yeah, right! Or the Cambodian air force or something! Of course the
                    Vietnamese were all upset because an F-16 can destroy them, or at the same time,
                    the later models could reach Hanoi, Haiphong and get home. I don't know how they
                    could with any kind of a bomb load. At any rate, Suittoo Chai Yuan wanted to
                    have an interview about that because in addition to be chief of the internal
                    unit, I was dual-hatted as the embassy's pol-mil officer. Suittoo Chai Yuan set
                    this up with USIS. The USIS public affairs officer came over, a man named Dick
                    Virden. Dick Virden is over here at Georgetown on some kind of a boondoggle
                    where he is a scholar, diplomat in residence or something like that. So there is
                    Dick Virden and Suittoo Chai Yuan and there is Dick Gibson.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The three of us are sitting there and we talked about this. I was rather frank
                    with him with what was going on. Basically the thing I said that was really for
                    background only, which we made very clear, was that we were supporting the
                    purchase. There was a lot of debate within the Thai government as to whether
                    they were going to buy these things or not, do we need them or not. Our judgment
                    had less to do with whether they needed them or not, as much as one, keep the
                    Thai military happy, they are your friends, and secondly somebody, whoever makes
                    an F-16, McDonnell Douglas or somebody, is going to make a lot of money. So it
                    was all a great deal. At the end of it Dick Virden reiterated to Suittoo Chai
                    Yuan the same thing that we had told him in the beginning, that this is for
                    background only and not for any attribution and so on, and so on. Suittoo Chai
                    Yuan looked at us and said “Yeah, but you know I think I want to attribute this
                    last part about the embassy supporting the purchase. I think it is very
                    important and I want to use it.” We said, “No you can't do that.” He said, “Yes
                    I can.” So he walked out and sure enough it was in the paper the next day.</p>
                <p>The way the policy was, we were publicly very neutral and we were not letting on
                    that we favored one side or the other. What this did of course was it blew John
                    Gunter Dean's cover. I just expected him to come in and cream me. Well, he
                    didn't. A day went by and I didn't see him. Then we passed each other in the
                    stairwell one day, two or three days later, and he smiled at me and gave me sort
                    of a shit eating smile, sort of a snicker. He said something, and I don't
                    remember his exact words, but it was something to the effect of “Nice interview
                    Dick.” He never said another thing to me and I attribute it only to the fact
                    that I happen to be on his good list. If I had been one of the guys that he
                    didn't like, I would have been pilloried hanging by my thumbs, or something like
                    that. He's quite a guy and I really liked him.</p>
                <p>The story is knowing how he ended up being ambassador to India afterwards too,
                    against the Department kicking and screaming. It goes back to this guy being
                    such a consummate bureaucrat. He knew exactly who was going to make decisions
                    and how things got done. When Mike Deaver, the White House chief of staff, was
                    in Bangkok doing preparation for the president's visit which never happened, it
                    turned out it got canceled, the ambassador got a hold of Deaver and really just
                    won Deaver over. He ended up being ambassador to India despite the Department's
                    objections. Anyway, I liked him. I thought he was an excellent ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've already talked about the situation down in the
                        south, how did you find Bangkok as a political entity? I mean operating in
                        Bangkok for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>GIBSON: For me it was a piece of cake except for just traffic jams and stuff. But
                    I was not at a level in the structure and organization where I would have any
                    problems. I was low enough down and in the trenches so to speak so that my work
                    was not difficult. People I wanted to see on the Thai side always saw me. That
                    was not a problem. We had very good relations. I didn't work a lot with the
                    Foreign Ministry because that was on the external side but when I would be
                    acting in the absence of the political counselor I would have to go over to the
                    Foreign Ministry sometimes and make a demarche on this or that and they were
                    very gracious. I was frequently in the prime minister's office. This was in the
                    days of Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda. Prem's staff and I got along very
                    well. They were very helpful and very cooperative. I did a lot of visit
                    organizing, scheduling of VIP visits of one sort or another and everybody was
                    always very gracious and always very helpful. I found it very easy to work with
                    the Thai. I didn't have any problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Thailand from '82 to
                        '85.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I wish I could recall the sequence and dates a little better but when I
                    was there the major domestic political issue was a new constitution. There had
                    been a coup attempt in 1980 and Prem had rallied the loyal forces and driven the
                    coup plotters out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a military coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yes. It had been a couple of years since the coup so we had to do
                    that. Prem was the knight on the white horse and he came in and drove out the
                    bad guys, typical Thai. Prem ended up as prime minister and in my book he is
                    probably the best prime minister Thailand has had in probably the last 20 years
                    anyway. There had to be a new constitution drawn up. The body politic was in
                    Bangkok which in those years was basically the body politic for the entire
                    country because that's where the elite lived. It is a little bit lesser today
                    but still largely true. The debate was over the new constitution and the real
                    issue here was what was going to be the role of the military. Prem had retired
                    and had become a civilian but he was still a soldier at heart. There was an
                    interim constitution wherein the Senate was composed of appointed people
                    appointed by the king in theory. It is like the Foreign Service list which gets
                    sent up to the president and he signs it after everybody gets it. Something like
                    two thirds or three fourths of all the senators were all serving active duty
                    military officers. They had basically full veto power over anything that the
                    elected lower house wanted to do. That was the way that the military and the old
                    guard kept control.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>These terms were due to expire in something like 1985 and they had to straighten
                    it out by then. They had to come up with a permanent constitution. The debate is
                    what are we going to do with all these soldiers in the Senate? Naturally the
                    democrats wanted to see the Senate elected and they wanted to see its powers
                    trimmed so it could not veto whatever the lower house wanted to do. The power
                    elite wanted to keep it the way it was. Then there was the issue of can you be a
                    cabinet minister without being a member of the elected lower house? Could you be
                    a cabinet minister while you were a serving military officer? These sort of
                    issues were all floating around. It was basically who was going to run the
                    country after the new constitution takes effect.</p>
                <p>At the same time there was a rising challenger, a general named Arthit Kamlangek.
                    The old thing about a modest man who was much too modest. He had much to be
                    modest about, but he wasn't a modest man. He was commander and chief of the army
                    and he was obviously taken with himself. He was very out in public all of the
                    time. He was a bit of a populist, always grandstanding and coming out with lower
                    taxes, more for the working people as he loaded money into the Swiss banks or
                    whatever he was doing. It became clear that he was challenging Prem basically,
                    and there were a constant series of coup rumors that Arthit was going to make a
                    coup and he was going to take over. There was a lot of focus on who in the army
                    were his supporters and who in the army were supporters of Prem and also by
                    direction of Chavalit Yongchayudh who was recently the prime minister in
                    Thailand. So there was a lot of attention on this and a lot of people thought
                    that Prem was either going to have to sack Arthit or Arthit was going to try for
                    a coup. As it turned out Prem did not sack him and Arthit did not try for a coup
                    and eventually rode off into the sunset. But this was the main focus of
                    attention back in those times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that it would be in a way difficult to be a
                        political officer where so much of the body politic decision making was made
                        in military circles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Professionally in that sense, that was a bit of a challenge. In truth the
                    people in the DAO (Defense Attach�'s Office) and in JUSMAG (Joint U.S. Military
                    Advisory Group) in Thailand, had far better access than most of us did to the
                    military naturally. What helped me in doing the internal politics is that I was
                    dual-hatted as the political-military officer which automatically made me a
                    participant in a whole lot of events so that I got to meet a whole lot of
                    military officers. Our military officers did not always like having me around
                    but they were sort of stuck with me because it was in my job description.
                    Despite the reluctance of some of the more senior U.S. military officers to
                    cooperate closely with me, I got on very well with some of the other ones. I
                    basically got on with DAO and the boss of JUSMAG didn't like me a whole lot but
                    his subordinates did and so I basically had access to all these military guys
                    which was a big help to me. I also was helped by having two very, very good
                    officers working for me. They had a lot of energy and were always running around
                    and meeting people. They didn't meet the military guys. I was meeting the
                    military guys. These guys were meeting the right kind of civilian politicians.
                    So it wasn't a big problem. It would have been a problem had not the DAO guys
                    and sort of the second level down guys at JUSMAG been cooperative. Had they
                    chosen not to be cooperative with me, it would have made my life miserable
                    probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at the top of JUSMAG, was this sort of endemic
                        to the situation that they were going to be dealing with troop to troop and
                        this political crap wasn't their business or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: It may be personalities. It depends who you get running the place. JUSMAG
                    has had an interesting past. During the Vietnam War years, JUSMAG was run by a
                    flag officer and they were clearly the preeminent military presence in the
                    country. They were into everything and had great contacts with supreme command
                    and this sort of stuff because they were providing goodies for the Thai, so they
                    had great access. Whereas the DAO guys, they are the spies. Everybody knows them
                    as spies and there is a little bit of arms length up here. At the same time, the
                    DAO guys know the right questions to ask about politics and a lot of time the
                    JUSMAG guys didn't. Anyway, what you had was a general officer and then it fell
                    off. The boss was always army. Army is the preeminent service in Thailand so it
                    made sense. Then it became a colonel slot. After I left it went back up to being
                    a flag officer slot for a while and now it is back down to just a colonel slot.
                    Meanwhile DAO is always headed by an air force 06, an air force colonel. At the
                    time I was there we had a stubborn bull headed air force 06 running DAO and we
                    had a stubborn army 06 running JUSMAG. Why didn't he want to cooperate with the
                    embassy? I think it was he had a personality problem and he didn't like
                    civilians: weenies, striped pants, cookie pushers. He felt that it was none of
                    their business what's going on, this is our operation, that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>To complicate it further, the DAO and JUSMAG didn't get along at all because they
                    were both the same rank and they both had different bosses. DAO reported to DIA
                    and JUSMAG reported to CINCPAC. There was always this tension and rivalry
                    between those two guys. Those two guys would never cooperate. They didn't even
                    like sitting in the same room with one another while their staffs did. You get
                    to the next level down and it was okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's usually how it happens. You let the big boys play
                        their games and life goes on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: They have to cooperate to get their jobs done. I am told that this was
                    not a situation unique to the time I was there. I am told that this has been a
                    problem in JUSMAG/DAO, JUSMAG/embassy relationship for years and years and
                    years. Of course it is all dependent upon personalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not just to Thailand, this is across the board. What
                        about some of the other factors in the internal political situation. What
                        about the little d democratic party? What was your impression of them and
                        contact and their effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: These comments will apply to today as well. Basically they are not very
                    effective. Why are they not effective? For a whole lot of reasons. One of the
                    reasons is there are so damn many of them. New parties are born, dissolved,
                    split, allied, disallied. It is almost that you can't tell the players without a
                    program. Because there are so many parties, it dilutes political power in the
                    electorate (and we'll get to that in a minute) so that your governments are
                    always coalition governments. This forces you to have a huge number of cabinet
                    posts and deputy ministerial posts. I think there are always at least two deputy
                    ministers of everything. It means that a party of modest size in your coalition,
                    like any parliamentary system, can hold you up for some really choice seats.
                    Then they get the choice seats and of course they milk them for all they are
                    worth and give your cabinet a bad name. But you need them to stay in power
                    because they will simply move over to the other side.</p>
                <p>We are not talking ideology here. In Thai politics there is no ideology, there is
                    only what is in it for me, what's in it for my party? Changing political
                    alliances is very easily done. Why is there no ideology? In Bangkok you have the
                    closest thing to an ideological commitment on the part of the voters and to
                    looking at party platforms as opposed to individuals and so on. You get out into
                    the country where most of the Thai live and where most of the MP's are going to
                    come from, they are in areas where basically it is local godfathers, local
                    political godfathers, sometimes gangster godfathers as well. Quite often it's
                    the same. Where ideology is not an issue the issue is, can you persuade the
                    voters to vote for you? Can you buy the vote with cash or can you intimidate
                    them through your henchmen at lower levels? Or can you bring public works or
                    somehow money to that district?</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Generally you find a very conservative countryside and they end up being elected
                    to parliament but their loyalties are very shallow. Their loyalties are
                    basically to themselves or to maybe three or four others in a click, or in a
                    group. You will find even within a political party that may look kind of large
                    on paper, there will be factions within the political party that at any given
                    time and set of circumstances, can cause the party to split and move over and
                    ally with an opponent or simply make their own party. So parties come and
                    go.</p>
                <p>You find a few major political players who because of their wealth basically, and
                    influence, are able to hold parties and coalitions together over the years. Guys
                    like Chatchai, the current guy, Chuan Leekpai, who does it because he's just, I
                    think, a tremendously good man at least in the Thai context, and Banhan,
                    Boonchu. There are some big political names over there that always can sort of
                    hold things together and they are always political players. Because of the
                    system also, there is no grassroots politics. There is no grassroots movement
                    like we know about. The political parties, at least when I was there the only
                    exception was the Democratic party, don't maintain offices at the constituent
                    level. In between elections, there is no party presence in any of the provinces
                    and districts out there. In some of them the Democrats would have offices in
                    major cities. There is no identification or loyalty to a party. It is loyalty to
                    a political figure who happens to be the political godfather of your
                    province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Patronage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Patronage, that's the term. The other thing is, the MP's do not have a
                    staff system like we do. They don't get a stipend for keeping an office in their
                    home district and for hiring a staff to go out and take care of constituent
                    complaints and this sort of thing. When I was there in the early '80s, this was
                    unknown in Thailand. If you are wealthy enough you could do that. You could have
                    your henchmen, your political subordinates down there, sort of ward heelers and
                    this sort of thing. But they weren't really staffed as such. They tended to be
                    more local figures, either a local businessman or a local politician like the
                    mayor or somebody on the mayor's council or the provincial assembly or something
                    like that, who would sort of serve as your helper in the provinces and you would
                    make frequent trips back.</p>
                <p>You didn't have that office system so there is no grassroots, there is very
                    little ideology, there is not deep loyalty to a party. As a result the parties
                    were not particularly effective and the establishment in the military could
                    always manipulate them. They could intimidate, threaten a coup, sow discontent,
                    sow discord of one sort or another and sow confusion by making political
                    statements, by getting their allies in the lower house of parliament to say one
                    thing or another. If all else failed, the house knew that if they passed
                    something the soldiers didn't want, the Senate would veto it. It has been like
                    that forever and I'm not sure of the current situation. I was away from Thailand
                    and back, then away again. It seems to me that under current reforms the
                    senators are actually elected now and I don't think you can be a serving
                    military officer anymore in the Senate. That's until the next time a coup takes
                    place I suppose.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think given this sort of amorphous thing and then
                        you have your establishment, you have the military, for a political officer
                        dealing with internal affairs what were you concerned with and what were
                        issues that would come out of this parliament and this political system that
                        affected the United States and how would we predict it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: None of it was going to affect the United States because there were no
                    ideological differences. It is not like if one group got in, policies would
                    change because there is no ideology here. There was a general political
                    consensus that you will move in this direction. One of the aspects of that
                    political consensus was you will keep good relations with the United States. If
                    coalition X is in power today and all of a sudden tomorrow there is a big
                    political upset and coalition Y is in, so what? From the standpoint of American
                    interests it is probably not going to make much difference. We weren't under any
                    pressure to sort of influence the outcome of elections and we never really tried
                    to my knowledge. What we would do, we would report. We would say this is what is
                    happening, and this is probably what is going to happen. What does it mean for
                    us beyond, not a whole lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here we are in '82 to '85. South Vietnam fell in '75 and
                        this was not exactly a shining moment for American policy in Southeast Asia.
                        Did you have the feeling by this time that had the influence and the looking
                        towards the United States in Thailand, wavered for a while and had (end side
                        1)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Right after Vietnam in '74/'75 you had the civilian government. In '73
                    the military clerk was overthrown and you had a democratic government in power.
                    As things were falling apart in Indochina and we were leaving, the Thai made a
                    determined effort to start mending fences with everybody in the neighborhood
                    like the Chinese, Vietnamese, Lao, Cambodians and so on. That started really in
                    the '70s. There were anti-U.S. riots and everything but that passed pretty
                    quickly. By the early '80s there was no anti-Americanism or there was no
                    lingering repercussion. The only thing that you had to keep in mind was that now
                    the Thai were very concerned about the Vietnamese in Cambodia because the Thai
                    don't like Vietnamese much, they never did.</p>
                <p>The Thais had good friends in Beijing so there was this Thai-Chinese cooperation
                    and good relationships which wasn't there in the old days but it didn't get in
                    the way of the relationship with the United States that I ever noticed. The
                    Chinese were aiding the Khmer Rouge through the Thai. The stuff would come in
                    through Thailand and be shipped across the border to the Khmer Rouge. That is
                    one of the sad parts about Pol Pot kicking off the way he did. We can't grill
                    him. We can't get him into court to see what really happened and of course a lot
                    of people are quite happy about that.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: But basically the Chinese were their main supporters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude towards the Khmer Rouge? They were
                        known as sort of the most odious regime of the 20th century which really is
                        something and yet the Vietnamese were messing around in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: It's not an area where I worked. My impression that I left Thailand with
                    in '85 from my colleagues in the political section was that at the time there
                    were three rebel groups: the Khmer Rouge, the KPNLF (don't ask me what it stood
                    for), and Funcinpec, Sihanouk's guys. Sihanouk's and the KPNLF were sort of an
                    alliance, a coalition. They the Khmer Rouge were all against the Vietnamese. We
                    were in those years putting our money on the KPNLF. We were sort of keeping the
                    Khmer Rouge at arms length although we knew very well that the Thai were
                    allowing aid from China to pass through to the Khmer Rouge. My impression is
                    later on well after I had left, that it wasn't there any more as KPNLF and
                    Funcinpec, they fell apart. We began to accept the Khmer Rouge as the only
                    viable anti-Vietnamese force and I guess we probably were closer to them than we
                    should have. I found it a strange twist in policy that these guys were such
                    villains and we find ourselves, in order to get to the Vietnamese, sort of
                    backing them. I don't know if we ever aided them or not. That's not an area
                    where I was aware, but I know that we took a much kinder view of these people
                    which I attribute to the fact that there were still too many bad losers from the
                    Vietnam War who felt that since we lost in Vietnam we were going to get those
                    bastards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point it didn't make too much sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Of course not. Sometimes you win wars and sometimes you lose them and
                    you've got to get on with your life. Before I skip it, part of the deal with the
                    Thai allowing the aid to the Khmer Rouge was that the Chinese would quit
                    supporting the Communist Party of Thailand and the insurgency in Thailand. In
                    the early 1980s, which was when we were watching, not closely but we were
                    watching, the Communist Party of Thailand insurgency basically fell apart. That
                    was a big factor. It wasn't the only factor but it was an important factor that
                    the Chinese agreed to quit aiding them. I don't know if that was ever written
                    out anywhere but that was their accepted quid pro quo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally when looking at the map of Thailand, Thais
                        are more powerful than the Burmese, why the hell haven't the Thais taken
                        over that very thin stretch along the Indian Ocean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>GIBSON: I think they did at one time. Historically at one point the Thai owned
                    that part then the Burmese whipped them fair and square and took it. Then the
                    Brits came in and the Brits solidified the border basically and I suspect that
                    that is probably why.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought there would have been a logical port
                        on the Indian Ocean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Moulmein and Mergui, there is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do the Thais have a free port or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No. They don't need it but in the old days they did. It is Mergui or
                    Moulmein, I forgot which, that used to be ruled by the Thai and there was a very
                    famous Greek adventurer who was their customs agent for the Thai king there back
                    in the 1700's or 1800's, I forget. But then the Burmese won it back and before
                    the Thai could take it back again the Brits came in. That would be my guess as
                    to what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the political stew of Thailand, what about
                        students, were they a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Not during my time. They were obviously in the early '70s. They brought
                    down Thanom and his gang of thugs and opened the way for democracy. It was a
                    brief period of democratic government before there was another coup and before
                    the military took over again in the person of Kriangsak Chomanan. In my time the
                    students were not particularly obnoxious.</p>
                <p>Another big issue at the time was succession. There was a lot of talk about who
                    got to succeed the king because the king's health was not good at that time. He
                    was suffering from some ailment. The crown prince who because of the Thai clause
                    of succession was and is in line to be the next to be the next king, is very
                    unpopular in Thailand, extremely unpopular. The king's eldest daughter married
                    an American and opted out of the system basically. The king has a son and three
                    daughters. The eldest daughter is married to a foreigner and therefore she is
                    ineligible to take the throne. The next sister is very, very popular with the
                    Thai so there was always a lot of toing and froing about what does the
                    succession really say? Can it be interpreted to such that the king can somehow
                    disinherit his son, which he can't. There was a lot of turmoil about that but
                    nothing ever got done. The crown prince is still going to be the next king as
                    far as I can see.</p>

                <p>GIBSON: I get to edit this out right? He's sort of an asshole, generic type. He
                    is a bully, a womanizer. Naturally he had an arranged marriage. He has since
                    divorced her and then he took a mistress who was a well known movie star. He had
                    three or four kids by her and he engineered it so that the illegitimate kids had
                    royal titles. He would travel around and be seen with his movie star mistress
                    and stuff like that. It caused a lot of embarrassment, unseemly behavior.
                    Apparently he is a terrible bully. He bullies his staff and physically beats
                    them. Of course none of them will hit him back, this sort of thing. He is just
                    not a very nice man in the popular image. On the other hand the daughter is just
                    a gem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your internal politics did corruption raise its head?
                        Was this sort of the mother's milk of Thai politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh, sure. Actually I was there during Prem's time and when Prime Minister
                    Prem was in office, corruption was largely kept in check. All Thai politicians
                    and officials do things that are okay to do in Thailand which would land them in
                    jail in the United States. You've got to realize cultural differences. It's a
                    different set of rules. In the Thai context, Prem was Mister Clean and he set
                    the tone in his government and so, while corruption is a way of life in Asia, in
                    the Prem years it was held largely in check. Yes, it was there and it was there
                    in business dealings and major contracts and everything too. Here again this was
                    before the economic miracle of the little tigers, or whatever it was. It was
                    just on the verge yet so you didn't have these massive infusions of funds and
                    that sort of thing. For example on a contract, like an arms sale, yes, there was
                    money leaking out all over the place. Any big investment in, say, telephone
                    where you've got foreign money coming in, there was money leaking all over the
                    place. At the higher levels of government, it just wasn't the problem that it
                    became in later years.</p>
                <p>Speaking of arms deals, there was an interesting case and I can't remember the
                    guy's name. I was actually allowed to testify in a Thai court and the Department
                    waived diplomatic immunity so I could testify in the court. The issue was that a
                    Thai general in the procurement system, had procured from the United States
                    through FMS a bunch of small arms. There were M-16s and M-203s as I recall which
                    is an M-16 with a grenade launcher on the bottom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about assault rifles essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>GIBSON: He bought these things through the FMS system and he had to forge a whole
                    bunch of documents to do it including documents with some U.S. signatures on it.
                    The weapons disappeared. We sort of all thought at the time that they ended up
                    in Indonesia. Where they went from Indonesia, who knows, perhaps Indochina or
                    Cambodia. Nobody knew where they went. The trail died. It was a typical case of
                    corruption and the guy made a lot of money out of it and everything but on this
                    one the Thai army went after him for some reason of which I'm not really sure.
                    It was sort of a typical corruption case. The guy was convicted and he was
                    fined. He was probably severely punished. I think he was transferred or put in
                    an adjunct post or something.</p>
                <p>That is the nice thing about the Thai military and the police, when you are
                    caught red-handed in corruption and in doing wrong things, they will punish you,
                    they'll transfer you or give you an inactive position. It doesn't mean they are
                    going to take your salary away or anything else, but they transfer you. I don't
                    know if this is true in the army because I think in the army it is a little more
                    on personal relationships, but in the police you basically buy your job. For
                    instance when I was in Chiang Mai at a later incarnation there, to be a traffic
                    policeman in Chiang Mai it cost 80,000 baht. You as a private or a corporate
                    Thai policeman, had to pony up 80,000 bucks as an investment. Once you're a
                    traffic policeman, presumably you are going to make your 80,000 back with
                    interest. So if some guy is paid 80,000 which is small scale, take a colonel, or
                    a major, or a general, he's paid big time for whatever job he had and then you
                    transfer him, you just broke his rice bowl. That is punishment in itself I
                    suppose if you are cynical enough to look at it that way.</p>

                        having just gone through not too long ago the Thai process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I just wanted to be in Japan and after my experience in Burma which was
                    the only country that I served in where I did not speak the language, I said to
                    myself I am never going to serve in another country where I don't speak the
                    language. I wanted to go to Japan but I didn't want one of the jobs in the
                    embassy where you didn't need the language. It is no fun to live in a foreign
                    country if you don't speak the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Extremely difficult. A poke in the eye with a sharp stick starts to look
                    pretty good after a few months of Japanese. It's the hardest language that I've
                    ever attempted and linguists say Japanese and Korean are supposedly the two most
                    difficult languages for a native English speaker to learn. I believe it. They
                    have incredibly complex grammar. Pronunciation is a piece of cake. That is not a
                    problem. It is not like Thai, where the real issue gets to be pronunciation.
                    With Japanese, the grammar is incredible and, of course, there is the
                    vocabulary. The American unabridged dictionary is about six inches thick. I
                    don't know this for a fact, but I am told by linguists that a Japanese
                    unabridged dictionary would take up a whole book shelf. They have just a
                    tremendous number of words and an awful lot of those words sound an awful lot
                    alike. Then, of course, you've got all the little characters. It's quite a mess.
                    I was never very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My other question was, is it a situational language? I'm
                        not sure if it is the right term but in Korea the language you used depended
                        who you were and whom you were talking to: above you, below you, male,
                        female, and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Japanese is that way but what the Foreign Service Institute does, it
                    teaches you the middle level, your basically polite conversation amongst equals
                    on the theory that you are a diplomat and you don't have to worry about it. It
                    is sort of an all purpose polite level and if you use that level you can talk to
                    anybody. As an American diplomat, you are fine. I will make a couple of
                    comments, observations, on the Japanese language program which I thought was
                    really good. They were able to make guys like me speak it passably well, well
                    enough to do my job. They deserve a real attaboy for that. Compared to the Thai
                    section when I studied Thai, the Japanese were much more business like, much
                    more organized, pushed harder, a lot less fun but they did the job a lot better.
                    I thought my three-three in Japanese was better on a relative basis, than my
                    three-three in Thai. I thought the Thai wasn't really a three-three though they
                    gave you a three-three. I could do more with my Japanese than I could with my
                    Thai as a three-three, that's what I am trying to say.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I think there are some problems with the program though and I think I was a prime
                    example. In 1985 I was 43 years old already. Do not take people at 43 years of
                    age and invest that kind of time and money into them, as much as I was enjoying
                    it. I wanted it so I was quite pleased but it makes no sense in a bureaucratic
                    situation. I think you've got to get younger people and do it. I think the other
                    thing you've got to do is somehow demand a high language aptitude. The personnel
                    system has subverted the old system where you had to have a decent language
                    aptitude. Now, and I was in personnel, we just assign people. If they don't have
                    the language, too bad. That person is going to Ankara. You are going to teach
                    him Turkish. I would see where FSI didn't really like that but they acquiesced.
                    I think in the Japanese program in particular, there really should be a level of
                    screening for the aptitude level. I don't say MLAT is the answer because I'm not
                    sure that test is all that good.</p>

                <p>GIBSON: It's MLAT isn't it, Modern Language Aptitude Test?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whether they use Farsi or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Kurdish I'm told. My MLAT score when I came into the service was 66 which
                    is sort of okay but it is not particularly good. They used to say the cutoff for
                    hard languages was 65 but it didn't matter because it all became moot because of
                    the changes in the personnel system. It goes all the way up to 80. Most of the
                    people I was studying with in Japanese were up in the 70s. The difference
                    between their aptitude and my aptitude in the middle 60s was night and day. I
                    really think the system is wasting their time on guys like me. I loved the heck
                    out of it.</p>

                <p>GIBSON: No. She's not going to study that stuff, she was raising kids, having
                    fun.</p>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Actually in '86 I went to Yokohama for the second year. The first year is
                    here and the second year is in Yokohama. In Yokohama I went with my son, and my
                    wife and daughter stayed in Falls Church. Yokohama was for about nine months and
                    the idea of ripping the whole family up to move there didn't appeal to us. My
                    son needed adult guidance. He needed somebody bigger and stronger than him so he
                    came to Japan with me. We were in Yokohama for about nine months or then we came
                    back and picked up the family, packed out and went to Okinawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Okinawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes. From '87 to '89. I was the political military officer there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation on Okinawa from the American
                        perspective and all when you arrived in '87?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The seeds of what happened three years ago or so were well planted. The
                    friction between the local Okinawan populous and the American military was very
                    real. The political strain on the island was leftist and not necessarily
                    anti-American but anti-military. They didn't like the Japanese military either
                    so it was sort of an anti-military attitude. It sort of got twisted around to be
                    anti-American in some ways, although I think that is overplayed. I think it is
                    just anti-military. They said, quite correctly, that we have all these American
                    bases on Okinawa that are taking up a lot of the good land, and there is not a
                    whole lot of land. I recall the population of Okinawa is maybe 1.2 million or
                    something like that, most of whom are on the main island. On the main island
                    nearly 20 percent of the land area is taken up by U.S. bases. I think it was
                    something like 15 percent for the Okinawan prefect on the whole but on the main
                    island I think it was close to 20 percent or maybe it was 15. I forget. Anyway
                    it was a sizable part and a lot of it was right down in the heavily populated
                    areas.</p>
                <p>You always had incidents in addition to the economic issue, the idea that if we
                    can get you out of these bases we can develop shopping centers, convention
                    centers, houses, whatever, there were the irritants. Nineteen year old Marines
                    are not necessarily the best diplomats that we can send abroad and most of them
                    are single. They are rowdy and obnoxious and they did a lot of bad things.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Then there are always the training accidents. When I was there, in the village of
                    Kim there was a big hoopla because the Marines that were training there with
                    live fire were not always shooting in the right direction with their live fire
                    and the bullets would land in this village. Usually no one was killed or hurt,
                    but there would be spent bullets around, through a window, or something like
                    that. There was another case where a taxi cab was driving down the west coast
                    road and from the east coast where we were doing some training (there is a
                    mountain range down the middle of the island) a 50 caliber bullet went over the
                    mountain range and shot the guy's taxi cab. It didn't hurt him, but it put a big
                    hole in his taxi cab. Sometimes pieces of airplanes would fall off, like a
                    sonar-buoy. A sonar-buoy is just a little thing, it's not really going to hurt
                    anything unless it hits you. Sometimes an extra fuel tank would drop off, empty
                    usually.</p>
                <p>At times helicopters would have to have emergency set downs. They would be flying
                    around and all of a sudden the red lights come on and the pilots would look for
                    a school yard, or a flat area to put their helicopter down. Whether it was going
                    to crash, that's an overstatement. That was the view of the Okinawans; the plane
                    almost crashed, they just barely got it down. What it was were the warning
                    lights telling the pilot that procedures had to be followed and had it been in a
                    combat war situation, he probably wouldn't have landed there. Still they have to
                    set down.</p>
                <p>Then there is the constant noise from the jets taking off and landing and going
                    right over populated areas. You add to all of this, at least when I was there, a
                    total insensitivity on the part of the American military commander to the
                    irritations they are foisting upon the Okinawans. One of the greatest
                    expressions, the first time I ever hear it, when the Okinawans would complain
                    about the roar of jets right next to their house or right over their houses,
                    “that's the sound of freedom”. Right. Anyway this was the attitude.</p>
                <p>I still remember this one thing. PACAF, Pacific Air Force at Kadena Air Force
                    Base, had an F-15 pilot who was their sort of regional demonstration pilot. He
                    was a tremendously good pilot. A 26 year old kid out there with a 40 million
                    dollar airplane having a ball. What they would do was every Wednesday afternoon,
                    or maybe Thursday, this guy to keep his flying skills honed, would get up over
                    Kadena Air Base and start doing his show routine which included full power
                    climbs, screaming dives, spins and all this neat stuff which of course is making
                    a racket like crazy. Apparently he couldn't do it over the ocean because with
                    the horizon and the ocean, you're asking for trouble. If you do it over land the
                    pilot can see what he is doing a lot better and he lives longer that way. The
                    Okinawans would complain. Why do you have to do it over Kadena Air Force Base,
                    can't you go and do it anywhere else? Why does it have to be right here in town?
                    Kadena Air Force Base was surrounded by town except on one side where the ocean
                    is. But the embassy said to him we finally, you know the embassy nagged them
                    enough and they finally quit I guess.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I'll give you an example of the insensitivity of the U.S. military. The Okinawans
                    attitude toward nuclear bombers and everything too, the B52, is not positive.
                    There is this famous picture at the officers club at Kadena Air Base taken
                    during the Vietnam War. It's a composite photo pieced together from a really
                    wide angle, showing something like 105 B-52s lined up at Kadena. Until reversion
                    in '72, that was a major bunch of bombers going over to Vietnam all the time.
                    The Okinawans just absolutely didn't like that. They are all anti-war,
                    anti-military because of the destruction that was wrought upon them. We had this
                    one general who presented a proposal from Pacific Air Forces, I don't know where
                    it came from, that as a public relations measure, the air force would send a
                    B-52 to Kadena Air Base and put it on static display and they would have with it
                    a mock-up of a nuclear bomb. How nice!! It is scary enough that some idiot
                    thought of this in the first place but then it was scary that the initial
                    reaction from the U.S. military in Okinawa was “Yeah, we could probably do that.
                    It might be a good idea.” Naturally we, the embassy, everybody, jumped all over
                    them of course and they backed off but it showed the attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is an important thing. I take it that as the
                        political military officer there you were dealing with a hostile power, the
                        American military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Not hostile. We just had different viewpoints. Socially, personally, it
                    wasn't an issue. It was kept on a professional level by and large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been a constant refrain of people, not in other
                        places but for some reason our military on Okinawa seem to lack the
                        sensitivity that has been drilled in military officers throughout Europe,
                        they really understand this. But marine officers that rise to the top are
                        considered by people who have been to the war college, as being really
                        better than the air force as far as understanding sensitivity, being more
                        politically aware.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The top marine officer when I was there until right towards the end, was
                    a guy named Norman Smith. He had a two year tour and came and went almost at the
                    same time as me. He was totally insensitive. I think he did fairly well after
                    that. I think he got his third star. He was a nice man, gracious socially and
                    everything, with a good sense of humor. Just a good guy, but he was totally
                    insensitive to the Okinawan concerns. Either insensitive or he just rejected
                    them as that's the price of freedom. We are here protecting Japan and if you
                    don't like it, well, you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet, that sort
                    of attitude. And it ran down. His successor I understand was different and his
                    predecessor was a little different too. There were two air force generals when I
                    was there who were both one star. They both struck me as rather insensitive
                    about the noise issues and things like that. They didn't seem to care. It was
                    just this overall attitude of we're here to protect you and we have to do
                    this.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I think there were seven marine generals on the island when I was there and they
                    ranged the full gambit from jerks. They had one, who shall remain unnamed, who
                    was an aviator and a complete jerk. Then you had guys like (can't remember
                    name). He was one of the slickest guys I had ever seen and could be an
                    ambassador anywhere. He was very sensitive, very intelligent, Scottish by birth,
                    immigrated to the States as a teenager. Bob, I'll figure out his name. He was
                    tremendous and really sharp. There was another guy who was a colonel at the
                    time, Colonel Zinni. Now I think he is a three star general and is really big in
                    the Marine Corps. These guys were really good and very sensitive. They would fit
                    the mold you are talking about, but there were a bunch of other guys who were
                    just sort of jerks. A mixed bag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we have, a consul general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: A man named Spence Richardson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our consulate general work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: His view, rightly or wrongly, was that the most important thing to him
                    was a good relationship with our military people there. He kept good relations
                    with our military people there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine the embassy would be breathing heavily
                        because obviously they had other fish to fry and I would assume that sort of
                        the mainland Japanese people would use the Okinawa situation to play up,
                        it's dead (or big) news.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>GIBSON: It would get the press whenever anything happened of course. Unlike in
                    Thailand where the ambassador is the boss, in the relationship between the
                    embassy and the military in Japan, the ambassador is not the boss of the
                    military over there. The setup is different. The commander of the U.S. forces
                    Japan is a three star and I think almost always an air force officer. Basically
                    when the ambassador is dealing with him, he is not quite like an equal. The
                    ambassador in the end will win but he can't just order these guys to do
                    something. You've got to work with them and you've got to persuade them.
                    Whenever you are talking about constraining their ability to train, you are
                    getting very close to the bone with those guys because they have seen in Okinawa
                    as well as the rest of Japan, a steady erosion of their ability to train and to
                    be prepared to fight wars. They resent that so I think that is probably why they
                    will fight anything that they see as a curtailment on their operational
                    abilities and on their abilities to train. The embassy has to pick its battles
                    very carefully. That is my view from someone in the trenches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that there would have been more
                        shuttle flights of airplanes and all over to Korea to do this stuff with the
                        Koreans. They kind of like to have American military around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: A lot of the Kadena Air Force Base wing that was there, the first air
                    division or whatever it was called at the time, (I think it went back to wings
                    but it was a division at the time) always had F-15s forward deployed to Osan.
                    They always had forward deployed units over there, and they had RF-4 phantoms as
                    reconnaissance birds. They were always over there fooling around. I think it was
                    a function of cost to take those F-15s, fly them all the way to Korea and play
                    all the games. With the per diem, the fuel and all of this, I think it was a
                    cost factor.</p>
                <p>I was thinking that I had come from an environment where the ambassador was god
                    and if he were a smart man like John Gunter Dean, he could have his way. John
                    Gunter Dean used to sometimes get generals in his office and chew them out like
                    buck privates. He was just incredible. The military knew from the minute they
                    walked in the door, they were not John Gunter Dean's favorite guys. John Gunter
                    Dean was boss and he let everyone know it, whereas in Japan it's that different
                    relationship. It is a much more cooperative, give and take relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mike Mansfield the ambassador still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, I guess he was the ambassador while I was there. Just as I was
                    getting ready to leave, Mike Armacost came and replaced him but basically it was
                    Mansfield. Mansfield was a nice old man and he wasn't going to go to war with
                    the military. I don't know what Armacost did, I had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides working with our military, what else were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>GIBSON: That's about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a full time job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yes. I'll tell you how things worked. You had asked what the consul
                    general did and what was his thing. This was a fascinating system. Whenever a
                    local community had a complaint with the military, the military had a policy
                    that the military does not see civilian protesters. In other words if Kadena Air
                    Force Base is making too much noise for the mayor of Kadena, the mayor of Kadena
                    can not take a protest note over to the air force general next door. That's
                    nice. The consul general said that these are all leftists doing the protesting
                    and they largely were because most people on the island are sort of leftist. He
                    didn't want to get involved in it because he had more important things to do,
                    which he did frankly. As pol-mil officer, I was the duty receiver of
                    protests.</p>
                <p>It was sort of seasonal but it was frequent that there would be protests. It was
                    so Japanese it was just incredible. They would come to the consulate and they
                    would sit in our conference room. There would always be a lot of them and we
                    would have no cameras, no recorders and this sort of thing. They would come in
                    all dressed up in coat and tie and very polite including sometimes a communist,
                    sometimes a socialist, and whoever. They would present me a protest letter. I
                    would welcome them with a few words and this sort of thing. The best Japanese I
                    had was welcoming people and telling them I was glad to see them, good relations
                    and all this stuff. Then the leader of the delegation would read the document
                    word by word and I would follow along. I had my FSN over here to keep me
                    straight and narrow. They would read it all and then they would sit back. I had
                    this spiel about how we understand exactly, this is a very sensitive issue and
                    very important to our relations and we want to be good citizens here on the
                    island. Usually the delegation would be from a local town or village so there
                    would be more than one party represented. The lead guy of each party would
                    insist on saying a few things and I would nod understanding about half of what
                    he said but with my FSN telling me the rest. At the end I would thank them all
                    for coming, shake their hands and lead them out the door. It was all very
                    ritualized. I would then take the protest note and pouch it up to the embassy
                    and fax a copy over to the marine base commander, or to whoever the appropriate
                    guy was. That is how we dealt with protests. We'd just take them all upstairs to
                    the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time the Soviet Union was going through
                        Gorbachev's period and things were beginning to change. Were any of you
                        thinking about maybe time is running out for Okinawa as far as a military
                        base?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes. The military were aware and they didn't want to hear about it. They
                    said we are here not because of the Soviet Union. This is Okinawa. This is not
                    the guys up on the mainland. We are here because of the Korean Peninsula. Just
                    because the Russians are starting to lighten up is not an indication that all is
                    well on the Korean Peninsula. They are right of course. Their point was we're
                    here to fight on the Korean Peninsula and to project power into Southeast Asia
                    and so on. That was their position and so they didn't see that as meaning they
                    had to pack up and go home.</p>
                <p>While I was there, there was the continuation of long protracted negotiations on
                    reducing the size of our bases and turning over unnecessary bases back to the
                    Okinawan land owners. I was the consul's representative on the meetings up in
                    Tokyo with the working level military guys on this. Occasionally some Japanese
                    military guys would come in, the Defense Administration Agency. They were
                    civilians but they ran the bases. We were doing that and I think as I understand
                    after I left, we did turn over a couple of places and a few years later we
                    turned over some more and this sort of thing. It is an ongoing process. We had a
                    lot of bases there on Okinawa and a lot of areas which we were not using but the
                    military still didn't want to give them up because they might need them. They
                    are right, they might need them. The land issues were tough.</p>
                <p>When I was there we put in motion to give back a couple of places but they
                    weren't very big, it was an ongoing process. There were areas that had been
                    turned back before I got there, in a couple of cases years before I got there,
                    that still weren't fully developed by the Okinawans because then the problem
                    became, you turn these land areas back, April 1945 took care of most of the land
                    records on the island. Once you get an area cleared of the Americans, you go in
                    an tear down all of those structures and everything and sort of prep it for
                    doing something with it, then you have to sort out all of the land ownership
                    records and that was an incredibly complex task. It would tie things up for
                    years and years. There were two pieces of land in particular that had been
                    turned over five or six years before I got there, and they hadn't done anything
                    with them because they couldn't sort out the land records. It's very complex,
                    the whole land thing in Okinawa.</p>
                <p>Occasionally on a military installation you would put a little fence around an
                    area about the size of this room. That land belonged to somebody who refused to
                    sign the lease to let U.S. forces use it. They were anti-war landlords so they
                    would just fence off their area and that was their little piece of land and we
                    couldn't use it. There were many landowners who were getting much for the land
                    that we had for our bases that wasn't really worth much, and on the open market
                    it would not have been worth much to the landowners. But because of the money
                    that the Japanese government was paying to the landowner as rent for us to use
                    those bases (we weren't paying for those bases), that made the landowners want
                    to keep the Americans there. So you have this split there. Meanwhile you have a
                    lot of the American military people convinced that they are the backbone of the
                    economy.(end tape 3)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with Dick Gibson. You were
                        saying that the economy was about ten percent of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Most American military commanders, their subordinates, and even privates
                    and their dependents, believed that without the American military presence
                    there, the Okinawan economy would shrivel up and go away. You'd ask them for a
                    guess of how much the U.S. presence contributed, and they would say three
                    quarters of the total GDP, or something like that, of the island that we
                    contribute to. They all really believed this. I pointed out to them that it was
                    really down to around 12 percent and that was an eye opener for a lot of them.
                    There was still this mentality among the American military there that this was
                    sort of our area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: There was a lot of that attitude there. The fact that a lot more Okinawan
                    and Japanese got killed than Americans got killed there, didn't seem to interest
                    them much. In fact the biggest casualty figures came from the Okinawan civilian
                    population. There was that attitude.</p>

                    second tour but there was no guaranteed mechanism. I remember when I first came
                    in they used to say that if you study a hard language, a one country language,
                    you have to assume that you are going to do two tours there. Right. I had to
                    fight like crazy to get my second tour in Japan. There is just no system for
                    doing that today.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chiang Mai of course had great renown at one point because
                        when we were running our operations against Vietnam, it was a major base

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I think you have that confused with over in the northeast. We didn't have
                    a base there, we had a MAG group. I think we helped fund the construction of a
                    10,000 foot runway in Chiang Mai and the Thai have long had an air force base
                    there that shares a runway with the civilian airport. I think all of the
                    missions over Vietnam, Laos, and so on were all run out of the northeastern part
                    from Udorn, Ubon, Korat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the history of Chiang Mai as a place, and then
                        we'll get to what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Chiang Mai historically, I guess until about the first couple decades of
                    the twentieth century varied between being an independent princedom, fiefdom of
                    a prince, that sort of owed allegiance, and paid tribute to usually the Thai but
                    then at certain periods the Burmese had it. I think the city itself was found
                    something like 700 years ago but it has changed hands. It's been Thai, it's been
                    Burmese, it's been Thai, it's been Burmese. I think the Burmese had it until
                    sometime in the eighteenth century and then the Thai got it back. There was a
                    ruling family up there who was pretty much on his own until somewhere around the
                    first ten or 20 years of this century the Thai crown in Bangkok sort of made him
                    an offer he couldn't refuse. He sold out for a stipend and the northern area was
                    incorporated into the bigger Kingdom of Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why have we had a post in Chiang Mai for so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We opened it in 1950. Actually the compound that it is on is owned by the
                    royal family and it is rented sort of for nothing. It is the former residence of
                    the last ruler of Chiang Mai as a independent kingdom up there. We opened it in
                    1950 which is about the time in the chaos of the post-World War II period that
                    there was a lot of trouble up in Burma. That was when the Chiang Kai-shek
                    remnants had come down into Burma and had occupied it and there was a lot of
                    fuss and trouble up there. That was when we opened up Chiang Mai.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Chiang Mai was really opened in its early years, and even to this day, more than
                    anything else because of the Golden Triangle drug business. In the early years
                    it was used as a support base for our operations with the KMT, the Chiang
                    Kai-shek remnants. As that died down, it was always used in training Thai
                    police, training Thai military intelligence operations run out of there and to
                    all kinds of places, including China. The CIA used to run intelligence
                    operations from there into China. It has mainly been a CIA post for years and
                    years until recently that's been being cut back as I understand. It's an open
                    secret that the CIA is there. Everybody in Chiang Mai knows it. We were there
                    for drugs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what we were doing in this '89 to '92
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: What we were doing then is much of what we had been doing for years out
                    of there. The post had five U.S. government agencies there: State, Drug
                    Enforcement Administration (still does), USIS, CIA, and U.S. Air Force. USIS
                    wasn't involved with the drugs much and neither was the Air Force who was up
                    there at a seismic station which they worked with the Thai navy. Other than
                    those two, the other three, CIA, DEA and the State operation there, were
                    primarily there because of the drug trade.</p>
                <p>I say the drug trade because in those years, in previous years, and to this day,
                    much of the drug production out of Burma comes down through Thailand, transits
                    Thailand. The DEA working with Thai police, and I guess the Agency guys helping
                    out too, have largely eliminated refining of drugs within Thailand proper. The
                    refining was done in Thailand and the drugs were brought down through Thailand
                    into the international market. There are all kinds of cooperative efforts up
                    there between DEA and CIA and the Thai police and the Thai army in trying to
                    suppress, or interdict these drugs. State had a fairly large program going with
                    the Thai army which involved us paying the bills, or most of the bills, for the
                    Thai army and for the Thai police to a lesser degree, to eradicate opium in the
                    fields and at the same time to provide villagers with alternative crops, seed
                    stock, saplings, this sort of thing and also to establish health facilities and
                    so on. That was really what we did most of the time.</p>
                <p>Added to that, this was a period when there was an awful lot of fighting between
                    the Burmese army and the Karen, primarily insurgents, along the border. Because
                    of our location we could monitor it much easier than could the guys at our
                    embassy in Rangoon so even though it was really sort of internal for Rangoon, we
                    did a lot of the reporting on it. With the troubles in Burma, in Rangoon
                    particularly, in 1988 the Burmese students came to the border and established
                    the All Burma Student Democratic Front, ABSDF. They were all strung out along
                    the border there and it was much easier for us to get to them than anybody else
                    so we did a lot of that too.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>We also did a decent amount of refugee protection work. In northern Thailand when
                    I was there in the consular district where we were, there was still a very large
                    UNHCR operated camp that took care of Hmong refugees from Laos. They had been
                    living there for years, along with some Meo and various other groups out of
                    Laos. Along the Burma border there were a lot of refugee camps, sort of informal
                    camps, taking care of the Karen refugees who came across from the fighting
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Burmese were fighting the Karen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, the Karen and the Hmong while I was there but the Hmong tend to be a
                    little further south, so the Hmong camps and the Hmong refugee areas were
                    usually down south of my consular district so I never saw them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these both mountain type tribes wanting to stay out
                        of the central government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The Karen-Burma feud goes back to late 1948 and early 1949 right after
                    independence when the Karen basically rose in revolt against the Burmese. They
                    didn't want to be part of the new union of Burma as the Burmese gained
                    independence in January of '48. In January of '49 after many months of
                    preparation, the Karens in the army mutinied. There were many Karen units
                    because the British had used the Karen extensively as soldiers. The mutiny
                    wasn't countrywide because the Karen's weren't countrywide, but it was
                    throughout the area of what is today the Karen State and up into the delta
                    region of Burma, close to Rangoon. In fact Rangoon was almost captured by the
                    Karen. The commander in chief of the armed forces in 1949 was a Karen. They were
                    a military tradition tribe. Hill tribe I wouldn't say, but in Thailand they are
                    hill tribes. The Karen tend to live in the hills there whereas in Burma they
                    live throughout lowlands and highlands in a particular area. They are still
                    fighting today but they are pretty well licked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we have any particular reason to support, or anything
                        else, what was going on in Burma or were we out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Our position was neutral. In fact I had instructions from the embassy
                    that I was not to meet with Karen leaders or any other insurgent group leader.
                    The idea was that we were totally neutral in it and that if I were to meet with
                    Karen officials, it would give the Karen false hopes like we were somehow going
                    to support them or something like that. At the same time, there are no secrets
                    on the borders so the Burmese would find out and they would think that we were
                    fooling around with the Karen. We very much kept them at arms length. I remember
                    a couple times I ended up seeing Karen officials purely by fluke. I'd have an
                    appointment with some Thai officials down at the border area and we'd meet at
                    the coffee shop, walk in and have a couple of Karen's at the next table. I
                    thought, oh shit, if the DCM finds this out he's going to lynch me. I made it
                    very clear that I wasn't supposed to be talking to these guys, no hard feelings.
                    Nothing ever came of it. I didn't bother telling the DCM. We tried to stay at
                    arms length.</p>
                <p>I'm all for human rights, don't get me wrong. I don't like bayoneting babies or
                    napalming children, but our human rights policies have skewed. It is good to
                    have human rights as an important aspect of our foreign policy but I'll give you
                    an example of how screwed up it makes things in our policy. For example, none of
                    us in our embassy could talk to Karen, Hmong, or any other insurgent group.
                    After 1988 when the All Burma Student Democratic Front guys came down, took to
                    the jungle with the expressed purpose of going into armed revolt against the
                    Burmese government, they came down into the Karen area and into the Kareni area
                    which was adjoining. They took up arms with military training. These guys were
                    the darlings of the State Department and we just kept wanting to send money and
                    humanitarian assistance, food, blankets, and all this sort of stuff, over to
                    these guys on the grounds that they were the victims of this terrible Burmese
                    government. I'll go along with the terrible Burmese government and all that sort
                    of thing, but not a terrible Burmese government, a Burmese government that did
                    different terrible things to the student demonstrators or any other
                    demonstrators.</p>
                <p>It was ridiculous. We could meet with the All Burma Student Democratic Front
                    people. We could go to their camps and we could talk to them. That was perfectly
                    fine because they were the darlings of the human rights people but the same
                    foreign policy issues were brought up. Are we giving them false hope? Not really
                    because we were giving them money and humanitarian aid. But on the other hand,
                    what are we telling Rangoon? We are telling Rangoon that we are interfering in
                    their internal affairs. To me it didn't make any sense at all and the human
                    rights people kept saying “these are just refugees and victims.” I kept sending
                    in cables pointing out, in fact to the point where I got into trouble, that
                    these guys are armed insurgents. They were insurgents from day one, that is why
                    they came down to the border so they could operate an insurgency. At one point
                    the DCM slapped my hands because I said that in a cable and disagreed with what
                    the embassy had said. He was right. I should have done it a little more
                    subtly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '89 to '92 period could you talk a little
                        about your relations with the embassy? Who was the ambassador and the DCM
                        and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>GIBSON: We had two ambassadors. The first two years I was there it was Dan
                    O'Donohue and the third year it was Dave Lambertson. Both good guys and both did
                    right by me. Lambertson was much easier to work for than O'Donohue. Dan's a good
                    guy, good sense of humor, but a micro manager, a nitpicker, and sort of a pain
                    in the ass to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I could see but I think I would just as soon want him some
                        outfit away from me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Dave Lambertson is just the opposite. He is not a micro manager. He is
                    much more laid back, much more prone to give his guys some rope and let them go
                    out and do things. Just totally different managerial styles. The DCM for the
                    whole time was Victor Tomseth who is now with the OSCE through the European
                    bureau in Croatia. Victor was a great guy, at least when Dan was there, of
                    soaking up the shit before it rolled far downhill. He was a real gentleman and a
                    pleasure to work with.</p>
                <p>I still remember one time when I sent my vice consul down to the border. He was a
                    first tour junior officer, a great guy and we are still good friends. This must
                    have been right after the elections in 1990 when the Burmese government wouldn't
                    let the opposition take power. He was down there in the border area where they
                    were all very pro-Karen and anti Burmese government and this sort of thing. He
                    came back and wrote up his reporting cables. On one he recounted how people were
                    asking him when is the United States going to intervene militarily? One scheme
                    was to have the battleship Iowa come up to the mouth of the Rangoon River and
                    shell Rangoon, paratroopers would go in and various things. So this was a little
                    tongue and cheek cable. I taught him how to write these cables with one
                    paragraph of what the news is, one paragraph with sort of behind the news stuff,
                    and then the third paragraph with comments. For comments in this cable he
                    writes, “Vice consul, unaccustomed to explain why the United States does not go
                    to war with countries with whom we have diplomatic relations, declined to answer
                    these questions.” It was something like that. It was really cute.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I said “Jeffrey I can't send that in, O'Donohue will skin me alive. It is just
                    too flip and too cute.” He says, “Awe, come on boss, you've got to do it, you've
                    got to do it.” I said “Listen you little twit, I'll do it but you watch I'll get
                    in trouble.” Sure enough, boy did it hit the fan. Victor Tomseth calls me and he
                    says on the phone, “Dick, the ambassador has asked me to call you about this
                    cable you wrote. He says that the last paragraph” and Victor was chuckling as he
                    was saying this, “that final paragraph is much too flip to have been sent out as
                    a reporting cable to the Department and neighboring posts and everything.” He
                    chuckled a little bit and he says, “and the ambassador asked me to point that
                    out to you.” I forgot the term he used but anything, bring me up short on it
                    basically like that, he says “There, now I've told you.” Then he had a good
                    laugh. This vice counsel was very clever with a good sense of humor and it was
                    really a cute comment. I wish I could remember it. But, O'Donohue was upset over
                    it but not overly. If he had been overly, I would have been in real trouble. So
                    I told Jeffrey about the conversation and said “See, what did I tell you.”</p>
                <p>They were both fine people and I've seen them both once or twice since and this
                    sort of thing. Victor Tomseth and I by the way are still friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I would have thought would have been
                        difficult would have been that with both the CIA and the DEA working on
                        drugs and all, here you are the State Department, in a way you would have
                        been presiding but not operating or something over this operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: This is why I really fault O'Donohue. When I arrived in Thailand as I
                    report into Bangkok on my way up to Chiang Mai for my welcome talk and meeting
                    with the ambassador and so on, both he and the DCM made it very clear that the
                    State Department lost control of the consulate up there. My predecessor was a
                    very nice man, but both DEA and the CIA had cowboys up there and they would run
                    circles around the guy and they just ignored him basically. It was very clear
                    when you got up there that the consulate general was run by CIA and DEA, it was
                    not being run by the State Department. The ambassador and DCM both told me that
                    one of my highest priorities was to get control over the place.</p>
                <p>I got up there and found myself having to deal with cowboys who would not
                    recognize any sort of State Department role for any of this sort of stuff. They
                    know what they are doing and I am just in their hair. We went round and round
                    for the longest time. For example, there was one incident where DEA was building
                    an addition on their own. On their own hook they just decided they were going to
                    build an addition onto the house that they were using as an office and it
                    violated FBO procedures and this sort of thing. The embassy told me to go and
                    get the plans and the details from DEA and the DEA didn't want to give them to
                    me. I explained and finally I got the papers and I sent them down but then they
                    reported down to DEA that I basically strong-armed my way into their office and
                    stole their documents and this sort of thing. There was just constant bull shit
                    like this.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>In fact the guys doing this were eventually finally both thrown out of the
                    country because they were in a bar room argument with some other Western
                    European type. They pulled out their revolvers and put them on the bar in sort
                    of a threatening manner to end the argument type thing. So the boss there was
                    actually thrown out of the country and so was one of his subordinates. These
                    were the kind of clowns that I was dealing with.</p>
                <p>Despite O'Donohue telling me, and Victor also, you've got to go shape them up, I
                    got zero support from them. I mean zero. The minute anything happened, “Don't
                    make waves. Don't make waves.” Typical State Department that had the senior
                    officer operation with the castration and they just would not back me up. It was
                    ridiculous. It took me about two years and thanks to some personnel changes and
                    me doing things which basically got me in trouble, but in the end I had control
                    of the consulate. It was after about a year-and-a-half into my tour that the
                    State Department was running the consulate again with basically almost no
                    support from the front office which I really fault O'Donohue. That is the only
                    thing I can fault him on. He basically gave me a big responsibility but no
                    authority to carry it out and that left a bad taste.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you did some things. I'm interested in the
                        management side, how does one control these cowboys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: At first I basically tried to jolly along, cajole, and “oh come on guys,
                    look we've got to do this because of this” and so on. This lasted for about six
                    months. Actually the CIA guy, I guess they are sort of a different personality,
                    refused to attend the first staff meeting when I got there. Okay. So I went over
                    and saw him and I said, “Come on, let's figure out how we are going to work
                    together.” I sort of looked him in the eye and said here's how I'd like to do
                    it. What do you think? We sort of got it hashed out. We had a pretty good
                    working relationship after that.</p>
                <p>The DEA guy, I played with him, I just chummied him along and jollied him along.
                    I had known him years before briefly in Bangkok. For about six months jollying
                    along worked and then Mel Levitsky, the INM guy, the drug guy, was coming out
                    for a briefing. The ambassador and DCM of course, as I was handling his schedule
                    up in Chiang Mai, wanted me to schedule a joint briefing with State, CIA, and
                    DEA for Levitsky. The DEA said “No. We will give him a briefing privately but we
                    won't participate in a joint briefing. If you and the CIA want to do it, go
                    ahead.” I said “Wait a minute, we've got to give him this and this is what the
                    ambassador wants. They said “no”, so I sent a cable down. I said “Look, somebody
                    tell this guy to be a team player because I've cajoled, I've begged, I've
                    pleaded and I've got nowhere with him.” Did that get me in trouble because the
                    ambassador didn't want to hear that. He doesn't work for me. He's the senior
                    representative there of another U.S. government agency and I can't give him
                    orders. There is absolutely no way I can. I can cajole and plead. Anyway,
                    finally the ambassador because I guess he didn't want a problem with Levitsky
                    said “Okay, do it.” He told the DEA chief in Bangkok and the Bangkok guy told
                    the guy up in Chiang Mai.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>After that relations were really strained and the DEA guy refused to let any of
                    his people talk to me without his clearance. If I had a question about narcotics
                    or something, I couldn't find out. There was nothing I could do about it except
                    I just kept working on him and said “OK, well let's have a meeting over at your
                    place.” I guess I'm getting this a little out of order. Early on I set up this
                    process where we would have a weekly narcotics meeting, the three of us. One
                    time at my place, one time at the Agency's place and one time at the DEA place.
                    We would just rotate it around and we would sort of talk about what was going
                    on. I always was an activist so I was always up around the border and I was
                    always seeing things that these guys didn't have a clue was going on with the
                    Wa, and Khun Sa's guys fighting. I always had something to contribute and this
                    sort of thing. I had my own contacts so it was pretty much a shared thing. Even
                    after DEA sort of declared war on me, I insisted that this committee keep going.
                    We sort of kept in touch that way then it just went one incident after another.
                    The guy had declared war on me and he had a reputation for being a very
                    difficult guy and sure enough he was. Finally he got his ass kicked out of the
                    country and things got a lot better at that point. The other thing that helped
                    out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way how did this incident with the revolvers get
                        back to the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I happened to be out of the country. I was in Hong Kong with my wife or I
                    was back in the States visiting my son, who was in school here or something like
                    that. I've forgotten where I was. I guess what happened was, I think the guy was
                    a Canadian, he went to the police. He called the police in and the police came.
                    The DEA guy started swearing at the police and said, “You can't take us in. We
                    are DEA” and so on, and so on. The police did take them in and took them down.
                    Of course, then it got out into the press. I was gone and in fact by the time I
                    got back both guys were gone. The ambassador finally moved kind of quickly. It
                    was my view that if the ambassador had all along been giving a little support,
                    this never would have come to this. Anyway I just sort of basically lucked out
                    because they got transferred. Had they not been transferred I probably never
                    would have gotten control of the consulate because I just couldn't do
                    anything.</p>
                <p>There were problems with DEA with things like housing board things. The consulate
                    didn't have a housing board and we had 29 Americans up there. The housing
                    decisions were made in Bangkok and DEA would get anything they wanted out of the
                    Bangkok housing board because they had guys on it and they made sure it all
                    happened. At the same time there were six air force guys there working with the
                    Thai navy. We had a beautiful housing compound with very nice houses, a fence,
                    it was good for kids, and all that sort of thing. The air force guys had always
                    been shunted to the side and had never been allowed to be on the compound so
                    they came to me and said “Is it possible for some of us to get on the compound?
                    We've got kids and families.” I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>So the next one that came open I said here is our proposal to the housing office.
                    I guess what I had done, I had established a housing office for the consulate.
                    Meanwhile there was a place coming open on the compound and what I did not
                    realize is that the housing office in Bangkok before I had established my own
                    housing office, had already assigned it to a single DEA secretary. It was a four
                    bedroom house on a compound and the single secretary is ethnic Thai. I didn't
                    know that and our housing board didn't know that because DEA didn't tell them so
                    we tried to assign an air force family into it with three kids or something like
                    that. That hit the fan. I made a stink over it. I said, “You can't do this.
                    You're discriminating against people because they are enlisted people in the air
                    force rather than high paid government employees. They are the ones with kids.
                    This woman is an ethnic Thai. She can function quite well out on the economy in
                    her own house.” DEA said “Oh, it's security.” Every time DEA didn't get what
                    they wanted, they said it was a security issue. We're at risk up here. They are
                    at about as much risk as I am walking down the street but that was their big
                    pitch all the time. They won. Here again the embassy just wouldn't back us at
                    all and here are the air force guys as second rate citizens again. We just had a
                    constant series of incidents like this but fortunately the bad guys left. The
                    others weren't so hard to get along with. It was just sort of the leader and one
                    of his buddies that were the idiots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of their effectiveness? The
                        problem with cowboys being free agents running around doing things, often
                        not speaking the language and all, (one always thinks of Oliver North and
                        the White House) is they really are not being very effective. I am
                        wondering, did you get any feel for how they were dealing with the drug
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yeah, I know how they dealt with it. They worked through Thai police
                    agencies. For example the DEA funded a company, maybe it was only a platoon, of
                    Border Patrol Police and they had them up there in Chiang Mai. The police of
                    course were working for their police bureaucracy hierarchy but the DEA funded
                    and trained them and this sort of thing. They would go out on operations and try
                    to intercept caravans as they were coming across the border and they would go
                    after refineries. Basically it was DEA paying for and operating the intelligence
                    net which located the refineries and then they would get together with the BPP
                    guys, the Border Patrol Police, and then they would go out and hit the refinery.
                    It was a cooperative thing. There is an office in Thailand which is sort of
                    semi-modeled on McCaffrey's office, the drug czar, called the Office of the
                    Narcotics Control Board, ONCB. The DEA guys would have a cooperative program
                    with the ONCB guys especially on things like wire taps and intercept kinds of
                    stuff. They would use the Thai technician and that sort of thing but they would
                    pay for it. They had a lot of cooperatives, it was all done cooperatively.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The DEA guys were not authorized to go running around on their own and they
                    couldn't really. They needed to work with the Thai police there. The general
                    consent or the general view of the DEA guys as expressed to me, was that they
                    didn't have much respect for the Thai police. They bad mouthed them an awful lot
                    on grounds of corruption mainly. In fact towards the end of my tour there the
                    successor as the DEA chief had such poor relations with the Thai police that he
                    couldn't get an appointment to see them because he was constantly running off at
                    the mouth about corruption and inefficiency. I don't want to say that it was
                    racism but it was that attitude. It was our little brown brothers, they just
                    can't do things as well as us DEA super guys. The Thai got tired of that and
                    just basically cut off relations with them.</p>
                <p>Basically I don't think the DEA was doing much good up there and I don't think
                    that's necessarily a function of DEA, I just think that the problem is
                    interdicting drugs. The most difficult way to enforce drug laws is to try to
                    interdict them once it leaves the area where it has been produced because it can
                    go in any way, shape or form. They would make occasional busts and that sort of
                    thing but there is so much of it coming out that I don't consider interdiction a
                    very effective way to go about the game. I think you do have to do it. You can't
                    just give up, but that's not the way to do it.</p>
                <p>Something we were doing, and this is where the CIA cooperate an awful lot, was
                    poppy field eradication. The CIA had a photographic lab and all this sort of
                    stuff in Chiang Mai and they worked very closely with the ONCB also, because the
                    ONCB people sort of coordinated a program of poppy field elimination in northern
                    Thailand with the army. That is what State did. We were paying for that
                    operation which would cut down fields of poppy before they could be harvested.
                    If you do that, you don't have to interdict which is like finding a needle in a
                    haystack. You can find poppy fields if you've got an aerial platform that takes
                    pictures. In this case it was an aircraft which actually the CIA operated. We
                    would fly up there and turn the film over the ONCB. We'd do spot checks on our
                    own but ONCB guys would plot all the fields and we would turn it over to the
                    army. The army would get in their helicopters and chug along out there. We would
                    all go out for an afternoon of cutting down poppy. It was hard work but it
                    worked. It was much more effective in my mind than trying to find the needle in
                    the haystack. DEA was working with the Thai police. I don't think they were
                    particularly successful but I don't mean that as criticism. I don't think anyone
                    could have been successful basically.</p>
                <p>To give you an example to show you the poor state of relations between DEA and
                    the police they were supposed to be working with up there, there is a great
                    story which happened about two months before I left or something like that. I
                    had great relations with the police. I had no problems. We read in the paper
                    that a BPP, Border Patrol Police, checkpoint up near the Thai border had seized
                    two Strelas, Soviet SA-7's or whatever, shoulder launched anti-aircraft
                    missiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strela means “arrow” in Russian.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>GIBSON: The first thing, we are on the phone. “Oh yeah, yeah, consul general come
                    on up.” They had brought the Strelas down to headquarters and we are sitting
                    there copying down the serial numbers and all the markings we could find on
                    them. We report all that back and we got the full story of how they did
                    everything. We got back to the office and one of the CIA guys comes in and says
                    “Hey Dick, can you get me in up there too?” “Yeah, yeah, bring your friend.” The
                    CIA went and did all the same thing so okay, great. Then DEA had their locals,
                    their FSNs, phone the police. The police wouldn't let the DEA guys even look at
                    it. And of course the Strelas were in route to Khun Sa who was into this big
                    time drug trafficking, the “drug lord”, prince of darkness, whatever. It showed
                    that the Border Patrol Police wouldn't even talk to DEA. Relations were pretty
                    bad and I don't think they were getting much better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides the drug business, were we looking at the politics
                        of the area? You are shaking your head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Nobody cared. I think there were two elections during the three years
                    when I was there because there was a coup in-between. When the election would
                    come around, we would all go start tromping around the countryside interviewing
                    people trying to figure out who was going to win and we'd play a little
                    prediction game. Actually we'd come out pretty close thanks to our Thai FSNs, no
                    thanks to us. They would figure it out for us and we would duly report what they
                    told us. They were pretty close. Then they would lose interest and nobody really
                    cared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political game was played in Bangkok anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, pretty much and in upcountry Thailand the way you get elected is you
                    spread a lot of money around. It's no worse than the way our own system works
                    probably but it is a little more blatant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thailand during this period and I guess up to today and
                        for a long time has been sort of THE vacation spot of Orientals and
                        Europeans for sex. Did Chiang Mai get into any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yeah. One of the early things that I got interested in when I got
                    there, and this young vice consul who I had who was a bachelor, was AIDS up
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AIDS being Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Basically
                        it is a deadly disease and you get it, you die.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>GIBSON: No one had done any reporting that we could see in the State Department
                    so in late '89, I hadn't been there very long, my vice consul went off and he
                    would go into brothels and ask “Are we using condoms in here today?” He would
                    interview the girls, the owners and this sort of thing. The Thai are laid back
                    you know. The guy's Thai was very good because he had been there as a foreign
                    exchange student in high school. We were talking to doctors and everything. We
                    get this picture of AIDS/HIV infection running high and it is scary, really
                    scary. We are finding things like service workers, I think was the euphemism
                    that is usually used for people, including those in massage parlor, outright
                    brothels, or coffee shops where the girls would go home or go in the back room
                    or down to the motel. You put all these guys together and something like,
                    according to Thai officials in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai which were the two big
                    tourist centers, two thirds of the women were infected with HIV.</p>
                <p>We found out things about army recruits in northern Thailand. Northern Thailand
                    had a much higher AIDS/HIV incidence than did the rest of the country for some
                    reason. The Thai system of drafting young men into the military is you do it
                    locally. They have local regions, they call them military circles, and they
                    draft from within their provinces and then they train them there. (end side
                    1)</p>
                <p>We were getting data from the army that showed that throughout the north in 1989,
                    the year we were doing this, 11 percent of new draftees or people called in to
                    be drafted, tested positive for HIV. In one province, Phayao Province, it was 17
                    percent. It was really scary stuff.</p>
                <p>We sent a cable in which we also addressed some other parts of the country out of
                    our consular district because we were getting things from the south and that
                    sort of thing from these doctors and medical professionals. Anything that just
                    concerned the north, we just sent. If it concerned any other part of the
                    country, we sent it down to the embassy for clearance. We sent it down there and
                    we sent it to Songkhla. Songkhla said fine. We sent it to Udorn and Udorn said
                    fine. The political counselor at embassy Bangkok who is now one of our senior
                    officers, he's DCM in Bangkok now, he spiked it. He said “You can't send this
                    because it talks about all this other stuff out of your district. Nobody is
                    interested in AIDS/HIV anyway.” I said “Fine.” I cut out the parts about the
                    south, the northeast and anything about Bangkok because we just had a composite
                    thing and then I just went ahead and sent it. The next day, or two days later,
                    we got back a big attaboy from the Department of State explaining how they were
                    really interested in this topic and how no one had been reporting on it and this
                    sort of thing. Egg all over the political counselors face. I don't know what his
                    problem was. We then proceeded to report about every six months or so on
                    AIDS/HIV and it is really scary.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Part of the problem was the girls that go into these places are basically
                    teenagers, they are young kids. In some cases, their parents sell them to
                    recruiters that go through an area. In many cases they are basically shanghaied
                    from Burma. They are hill tribe girls brought down from Burma. They hardly speak
                    Thai. A lot of them are Shan and they speak Shan, which is similar to the
                    northern Thai dialect, but it is not really good Thai. It is more like a local
                    dialect in the north. It is perfectly good Shan. It is just they don't
                    necessarily get along well. They are kept basically as prisoners in a lot of
                    cases. These girls don't have a clue. They don't even know what AIDS/HIV is. The
                    Thai men, and, as I'm told, Japanese men as well, (I'm not sure that is true any
                    more) didn't like condoms and just wouldn't use them. You had all these young
                    girls with basically no defense at all, they are prisoners basically, wage
                    slaves, indentured servants, and they had not a clue. These drunken young Thai
                    guys would come in and AIDS was really spreading. There was some homosexual
                    transfer and there was some IV transfer, but most of it was through heterosexual
                    sex. It was really a scary situation up there and we, of course, tried to tell
                    any Americans we could get our hands on that if you go into these places you are
                    crazy, but they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you noticing deaths resulting from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No, not yet. No, and this was one of the things that, as one of the
                    doctors up there told us, “You don't have to have an anti-AIDS campaign in
                    Thailand in a couple of years because in a couple or three years everybody in
                    northern Thailand is going to know somebody who has died of AIDS.” It was that
                    widespread. Of course, in Thailand, the health system just can't handle it.
                    There were some people dying of AIDS already in the hospitals and their wards.
                    We went in and saw some of them. Boy, that is a scary thing. But basically it
                    was in the early stages. It was HIV, and it hadn't reached full blown AIDS yet
                    but the doctors were saying in a few years people will be dying all over the
                    place around here and our health system won't be able to take care of them. They
                    are going to have to die at home. They are not going to be able to die in the
                    hospitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been back to Thailand. Did you see this
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>GIBSON: I haven't looked into it. I have been back to Thailand doing research on
                    this book I am working on. I don't have a clue. It has not come up in any of my
                    conversations. I talk about drugs. I've seen in the news or read articles or
                    something that the rate of increase in HIV infection in Thailand has gone down.
                    The Thai public health people are pretty good and once they get energized on an
                    issue, they usually start making progress. I am told that in the last few years,
                    the rate of increase has declined. It is not as bad as it used to be and it is
                    getting better but there are still an awful lot of people over there with HIV
                    infections. I did notice in Bangkok walking around town that a couple of the
                    massage parlors that used to be down in the Sukhumvit area are empty or torn
                    down and something else has been built. I don't know if that is because people
                    are getting smart or because the property value has gotten so high that they
                    moved them out of town. I don't know which it was but I did notice a couple were
                    no longer operating and they were great big multi-story buildings. It has not
                    come up in any of my conversations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than the drugs and other things, were there any
                        other things we might discuss about your time in Chiang Mai or did this
                        pretty well occupy your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, that pretty well occupied my time. I did a lot of time in a four
                    wheel drive along the border basically monitoring the insurgency and the drug
                    trafficking operations on the other side of the border. I spent a lot of time
                    out with the Thai army cutting down opium fields and looking at assistance to
                    villagers. I also spent a lot of time looking at the general economic
                    development in the north, working with the royal project which the royal family
                    sponsors for development programs for the hill tribes to get them away from
                    poppy growing.</p>
                <p>There is another active organization there sponsored by the Taiwanese government
                    called the Free China Relief Association which has a whole lot of baggage with
                    it in its history including supporting the KMT when they were in Burma and being
                    an intelligence operation as well. At the same time they have done some very
                    good development work and I spent a lot of time with those guys which is now
                    paying dividends and giving me access to talk to the people I want to talk to
                    for my book. I spent a lot of time going out looking at their projects, talking
                    to people, and trying to figure out why did economic development come to a
                    particular area. In other words, how are you going to spend your development
                    dollar? Are you going to spend it for schools, or health, for new plants, new
                    crops, roads, electricity, water? What are you going to spend it on? I learned
                    an awful lot from that on which we duly reported. Whether anyone ever read it or
                    not, who knows. Basically that was what I spent most of my time on.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I spent a lot of time at public ceremonies that you've got to go to. This is a
                    Buddhist feast day so you've got to go give something to the monks. Okay, so my
                    staff would hand me something and I'd go out there and hand it to them. They'd
                    say you've got to go see the queen's sister who is up here, you've got to go
                    give her some money. Okay, we'll give her some money. I was just led around by
                    the nose by my Thai staff like most of us are for the protocol thing. You've got
                    to do this, do that, so that took a lot of time. A lot of traveling around the
                    north. We all traveled a lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your border excursions and all, were you picking up any
                        feel for the Burmese situation, how the army was doing? What was happening
                        in Burma during this '89 to '92 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yes, anything along the border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reading on the Burmese and their
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: That is an emotional issue and this is one of the problems with, I think,
                    our foreign policy towards Burma as well as the activists and everything. I
                    think that I am one of the few people around who try to take an objective middle
                    of the road view on Burma. Our government policy is so screwed up toward Burma
                    that it's a joke. We are totally a whipped dog by the human rights activists.
                    There is nothing wrong with human rights, but we take Burma, which is a country
                    where we have no interests basically, and we are really tough with them. We put
                    economic embargoes on, and sanction this, and we bash them and beat them, and
                    everything. Whereas what Hun Sen did in Cambodia a year-and-a-half ago or so
                    ago, far outweighs that and we're not doing anything to Hun Sen. What the
                    Chinese do far outweighs anything and the same is true with what the Indonesian
                    government has done in Timor. You've got a reaction to Burma that it's a country
                    that is not important to us so all of our grandstanding leaders get out there
                    and knuckle under to “Let's Bash Burma Day”. I think it is stupid. It's a self
                    defeating policy. They don't understand the Burmese. The Burmese are the most
                    stubborn people in the world and beating on them just makes them tougher. The
                    way to win the Burmese over is with honey. You get a lot more flies with honey,
                    etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>On the other hand, clearly they are committing atrocities. Clearly the way they
                    are treating the ethnic minorities inside of Burma is not good. Did I get a feel
                    for what they do? Yes. They're press ganging corvee labor for porters for their
                    army when their army is on operations against Karen, Palong, or Shan. Armies in
                    Asia have done that forever. During the 1950s when Burma was under the
                    democratic government of U Nu, the darling of the world's democrats and a fine
                    man, a great man, the army press ganged civilians to act as corvee labor. That
                    has always been that way. Living off the land, meaning fielding rice or
                    appropriating rice from villagers, went on in the '50s. The Chinese operated
                    that way. The Thai to a degree in the early days operated that way. That is how
                    Southeast Asian armies were traditionally operated because there was no budget.
                    Rangoon will send an army unit out in the field, give them a set of operating
                    orders and give them a little bit of money to buy food and stuff with but not
                    near enough. They are expected to live off the land basically.</p>
                <p>The Burmese army is doing not nice things. All of these forced relocations you
                    read about of villagers, Shan or Karen villagers, was exactly what we were doing
                    in Vietnam with the strategic hamlet concept. The Burmese call it the strategy
                    of the four cuts: you cut off this, you cut off that, you cut that. Basically
                    what it is, you take an area that is heavily infested with the insurgents and
                    you just move all the people out so there is nobody there to grow the rice for
                    the insurgents, there is no place for them to hide, and the army can go after
                    them. It is brutal and I'm not even sure that it's very effective but that is
                    the way they operate. It didn't work for us in Vietnam. I don't know why it
                    should work for the Burmese in Burma. We refuse to recognize why they are doing
                    these things.</p>
                <p>I can see all that happening and you can see it down on the border. You can watch
                    them wage war against the Karen for example. Actually, the Burmese have a pretty
                    good army. They know what they are doing. I'd watch battles. I'd go down on the
                    bank of the Salween River and watch the fighting, watch the bodies floating down
                    or I'd have been on the river and seen the bodies floating down. I'd watch the
                    artillery barrages going back and forth. About three or four years ago I guess,
                    the Karen really lost their last big strongholds along the border. The Burma
                    army just built roads. They just kept building roads into the Karen areas. You
                    build enough roads, you can get your troops in there and you can stay during the
                    rainy season which you couldn't do before. It is a long slow process but it
                    works. Now in the meantime are they making Joe citizen work for free on the
                    road? They sure are and it's bad. Are they raping Joe citizen's daughter? Yeah,
                    they probably are and that's bad too. They don't all do it but it depends on how
                    much discipline and the quality of the officer that's there. You could see it
                    all going on.</p>
                <p>At the same time you could see the ineptness of the Natural Government of the
                    Union of Burma, NGUB, which is the government in exile and some of Suu Kyi's
                    people from the NLD, National League for Democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's the one that won the Nobel Prize.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Right and her party won the 1990 elections fair and square and by all
                    right she should be the prime minister of the country right now. Many of her
                    supporters after the military crackdown ended up along the border. These guys we
                    were also allowed to see because they weren't taking up arms, unlike the
                    students. What a feckless and inept bunch of people, they are hopeless. They are
                    ineffectual, totally unimpressive people. The army has basically eliminated
                    everybody. The opposition has either been put in jail or they have co-opted
                    them, bought them out. The ones like the NGUB, who are the foreign spokesmen
                    government in exile, the cynics in Rangoon say “This is great because those guys
                    are so inept that the world sees these guys as the representatives of Aung San
                    Suu Kyi,” which they aren't really. Aung San Suu Kyi is much better than any of
                    these guys ever dreamed of being, but the Burmese say “Well fine, if that's what
                    they want to think of the opposition, let them meet these guys.” That's perhaps
                    too cynical but it's sort of the attitude. We could see it all daily because we
                    had this great contact all the time and the Thai had business over there. Some
                    of them were loggers over there.</p>
                <p>In fact the logging contracts come in for a lot of criticism by political
                    activists, by environmentalists, and one group or another, quite rightly so.
                    What happened was, starting in 1989 the Burmese figured the insurgents are
                    cutting down all the trees and selling them to the Thai and making all the
                    money. What Rangoon did, they figured we don't control those areas anyway but
                    here's what we'll do Thai. We will grant you concessions and you will pay us
                    royalties per log. You can go in and cut down these teak logs and bring them
                    back out in the border area. We will send our forestry and customs people down
                    to sort of monitor and you'll get letters of credit at the bank and we can check
                    them up. The Burmese officials would be on the Thai side of the border because
                    if they are on their side they would be shot by the insurgents.</p>
                <p>The Thai lumber companies would pay off the insurgents. They are paying in
                    Rangoon one hunk of money and then they are paying the Karen or the Shan or
                    somebody another hunk of money, then they are going in and cutting them down and
                    bringing the wood out. It is giving Rangoon money which they can then buy more
                    guns with to suppress the insurgents. But also what it's doing is it's building
                    a logging road system along the border which then if the Burmese can come hook
                    into it with their army built roads, they can change the balance of power along
                    the border, and they have. The Thai made a lot of money and the world lost a lot
                    of very old teak trees and very young ones unfortunately. I guess you can argue,
                    cut down the old ones that's okay, but they cut down the young ones too. A lot
                    of corruption.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '92 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I came back to Washington and I was sent to personnel in PER/CDA, Career
                    Development Assignments.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: From '92 to '94. It was PER/CDA/JO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Junior officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes. I was chief of the unit that did the assignments and the career
                    counseling for all junior officers on their first two tours and going into the
                    third tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation because I was thinking it would be
                        we were going through a lot of budget cuts and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: That was a problem but a bigger problem was the fact that sometime well
                    before I got there, like three or four years before (when I clean this up I will
                    look back and I might be able to find it out of on old EER or something like
                    that) the Department had changed the FAM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Affairs Manual which is basically the
                        operating instructions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Right. They had changed the system and they had set by a certain date a
                    new set of criteria. I've really got to go back and look on this. Basically what
                    they had done, they had put in the FAM a new system for tenuring and promoting
                    junior officers but then nobody had bothered to write up any procedures for it
                    or to negotiate anything with AFSA or anything else. I got there one year from
                    the time that all this was supposed to take effect and no one had done anything.
                    So that was the biggest headache for me in that period. I let basically the
                    other people on the staff handle the assignments and counseling largely. We
                    divided the JO's up by alphabet groups and I had a very small alphabet group
                    because I had other responsibilities. Basically I let the rest of the office
                    handle the assignments for like new officers coming in, who gets to go where and
                    this sort of thing. I let them broker deals amongst themselves and take care of
                    that. I sort of had oversight and would break ties and settle disputes but I
                    spent most of my time trying to figure out a new way to do junior officer
                    commissioning and tenuring.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>What we had to do was we had to first of all, within the broad personnel system,
                    negotiate a new proposal. We came up with several proposals and many times we
                    would kick it up and Genta Hawkins Holmes, the director general, would bounce
                    it. She didn't like this or she didn't like that so we would go back and start
                    over again. We ended up sending her up several choices. At the same time the
                    lawyers were always in there. This was my only experience in life with State
                    Department lawyers and my view of lawyers had always been that the policy makers
                    should be able to go to lawyers and say “we want to do this, how can we do it?”
                    The lawyer would say you can do it if you do this or that. Not our lawyers in
                    personnel. You'd go to the lawyers who had the personnel account and they'd say
                    “no, you can't do that.” It was almost like the people in L who handled PER
                    bureau wanted to make the policy so they were constantly putting up legal
                    roadblocks for us. We were constantly having meetings to negotiate things. Then
                    either L would bounce or Genta Hawkins Holmes would bounce or her deputy would
                    bounce or somebody. After a long process we finally negotiated a revision to the
                    FAM. I guess that was it. There had been a policy decision that we were going to
                    do something different and then no one had ever put it into the FAM so we were
                    writing the FAM.</p>
                <p>Once the personnel bureau or the Department therefore agreed to a policy, we then
                    had to negotiate with AFSA, the American Foreign Service Association, which is
                    our union sort of. We had a labor management negotiator or a professional, and
                    he headed the team. I was on the team and there was another officer on the team
                    from personnel and we negotiated with AFSA. We negotiated through several
                    sessions and various versions and by the time we had finished, AFSA had gutted
                    most of what Genta Hawkins Holmes had agreed to. We ended up with sort of an
                    uneasy compromise which I don't really recall it being very good at this point.
                    That took up most of my time and as soon as I could get out of personnel, I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these negotiations were there any real issues of
                        substance or was it more in form? Were there any real issues that you can
                        think of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I'll have to sit and sort of reflect and try to remember what the issues
                    were. As much time as I spent on it, there were so many proposals out there that
                    I'm really not sure which ones finally came down. We had really bizarre
                    ones.</p>
                <p>The issues were how do you cone an officer? That was it. The courts had ruled
                    that our system of assigning a cone to an officer as they came into the service
                    was illegal because there was no correlation between test scores or background
                    or anything like that, and success in a particular cone, including the economic
                    cone, by the way. The courts ruled that the system was bad so we had to get a
                    replacement system by a certain date and no one had done anything about it. Then
                    I arrived and was handed this mess.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>The lawyers were terrified. They had lost the women's class action suit, they
                    were in the process of losing the black officers' class action suit. They were
                    just terrified of anything that they would have to really put any effort into
                    because they figured they'd lose. We have a great bunch of lawyers who lose
                    every case that they take on. It tells you something. Their solution was random.
                    As new officers come in they were to pick a number or a computer assignment. It
                    just went on and on. That was the lawyers way because then it would be totally
                    free of bias or anything else. Genta Hawkins Holmes idea was to let them all
                    chose whatever they want. We convinced her that if that was the case, you're not
                    going to have any consular or admin officers, you're going to have all political
                    and economic officers. We did a little informal polling and convinced her and
                    she backed off of that. What we finally came up with was a system whereby they
                    would come in unconed. When the courts ruled that you couldn't cone them on
                    entry, they were coming in unconed.</p>
                <p>At the end of the five year mark we had to commission them. When you commission
                    them, you had to assign them to a cone. It had been four years and that first
                    group that was going to get commissioned and coned was coming up and there was
                    no procedure to commission and cone them. It's coming back now. The way we
                    finally ended up doing it was that we brought the promotion panels into it
                    kicking and screaming. They did not want that at all. I don't know if the system
                    held up because it wasn't a very good system. None of us liked it. It was an
                    awful compromise. What we did was when the officers were coming up due for their
                    commissioning, we got a rank order of all junior officers who had been
                    recommended for commissioning. There were x number of spots for political, x
                    number for economic, x number for consular, x number for administrative. They
                    all submitted their choice order (first, second, third, fourth) ranking then we
                    would match a name against the list. Number one, you want to be an economic
                    officer. Okay, you'd get it. By the time you got down to a certain level, people
                    were going to start getting unhappy at some point along the line, but I think
                    that is the way it ended up.</p>
                <p>I think another proposal we had which got rejected, and I think my own approach
                    to it was, we would take them in rank order. We had a way so that the top
                    officer would be in one cone, the second officer would be in the other cone, the
                    third officer would be in the other cone, and the fourth officer would be in
                    another cone. This way you always had top grade as well as low grade performers
                    in all four cones thinking that that's going to keep everybody happy. We tried
                    all different systems like that but in the end it came down to just a straight
                    rank order and you get to pick your cone. I don't think that lasted. We all saw
                    it at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would tend to put basically your best people...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Not the best people but the people who got the best EERs. There is a big
                    difference there.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely but that would tend to perpetuate you might say
                        the class difference, the social class difference or whatever you want to
                        call it, between political top, economic kind of a secondary but they are in
                        trade kind of type thing, and then consular and admin down, these are people
                        that have to do things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: That's right. The approach I liked, and I forgot the exact system that we
                    had worked out, was I think we'd take say 100 officers and we'd rank the 100
                    officers and take the first 25, second 25, the third and fourth. We'd separate
                    all the 25s out and then we would make the top 25 all select one of the four
                    cones but we would ration the number of slots in each cone available to that top
                    25 officers so that some of that top 25 went to every cone. Then we would take
                    the next tranche down and that's how we wanted it. We were trying to get rid of
                    that class distinction. It didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression during this '92 to '94 period of
                        the incoming officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Some of them were quite good. Some of them I could not understand why we
                    were bringing them in. We had too many lawyers basically, they are not
                    necessarily good officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lawyers are not, I'm speaking as a retired Foreign Service
                        officer and lawyers are not a particularly good recruiting ground.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Some of our classes would have 25 percent of people who had law degrees.
                    We had a lot of people as second career. I don't mind that because when I came
                    in most of them were right out of college and I'm not sure that is a good idea.
                    I think we need people out there with wide experience. You'd get retired
                    lieutenant colonels. Okay, he did his 20 years and retired as a lieutenant
                    colonel. Back in those years that still wasn't a very good performance. This
                    person did not perform very well in the military. If he had been a good
                    performer he would have been a colonel especially if you were in a line as
                    opposed to a support. He is coming in again, starting all over and what's his
                    motivation?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nowhere to go because of age essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>GIBSON: There had been ruling that we could no longer discriminate on age as a
                    result of a law case, another one that our lawyers lost. I remember we took in
                    this one woman, this was a particularly perplexing thing, a very nice lady. I
                    just liked her personally. Under the rules for tenuring and commissioning we had
                    to give everyone a chance to get off language probation so we had to train this
                    lady in Spanish which was the easiest language we could find to train her in.
                    Let's face it, as we get older, you and I know that you don't learn languages
                    like you do when you are a kid. This woman had time for two assignments before
                    she hit 60 and mandatory retirement. Why we brought in someone like that and
                    wasted taxpayers money and resources when we could have been bringing in
                    somebody who was, say, 28 and with a whole career ahead, I couldn't believe
                    it.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I found the officers a very mixed bag. Some of them were excellent and
                    some of them I subsequently saw and they are terrifically good officers. Others
                    are really pretty poor performers. One thing my colleagues and I all know is
                    that, (maybe it was because we were all the dinosaurs and the old guys, we had
                    come in during the Vietnam years and most of us were vets,) except for a few
                    retired guys coming in the second time, none of these guys had any military
                    experience at all. Maybe it was because we had been vets, maybe we had been
                    through a war, maybe because we were overly patriotic and we really believed in
                    public service and we really believed that one of the highest callings you could
                    have in the United States was to be with the government be it military or be it
                    civilian, working helping people, helping the country and that sort of thing, a
                    sense of public service. It is absolutely gone. This is something that we all
                    would sit back and just shake our heads over, all of us older guys. This was
                    something which you can't blame on the junior officers. It is probably a
                    reflection of society more than anything else. It is really discouraging. I
                    didn't have a real high opinion of most of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this manifest itself, this lack of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We'd have bull sessions and sit around with a brown bag lunch. “Why did
                    you come in?” “Because I want to travel.” Or “The money's pretty good. It was
                    more than I was making as a teacher.” “I want to learn a trade.” Nowhere did
                    public service come up and you could see it as you'd start talking to them about
                    their assignment. “Now where do you want to go?” “What's going to get me to the
                    top?” Very ambitious. The naked ambition of the junior officers that we were
                    bringing in was astounding. When we came in there were some really ambitious
                    people but they hid it. When we all came in, the consensus was whatever job you
                    do, if you do it well you will get promoted, you will be rewarded. Now because
                    the system has changed and the perception was, and I think quite rightly so, to
                    get ahead you've got to have the right jobs.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>We had officers that didn't want to go overseas. “You can't send me overseas.”
                    “Yes we can. We are required to. The regulations say that one of your first two
                    assignments must be overseas.” “No, I don't want to go overseas.” I've got a
                    heart murmur, or I've got asthma, or I've got this, or I don't want to go there,
                    I want to go to London. It was very difficult to deal with that sort of thing
                    whereas when I came in, I would say, “Where are you going to send me? Oh, you're
                    going send me there. Okay. Sure. It's not my first choice but I might as well go
                    and try it out.” Not these guys. There were a few that liked the hardship idea
                    but most of them wanted the cushier job or they didn't want to go overseas at
                    all, they wanted to be staffers on the seventh floor. It was all figured out how
                    you get ahead. It's a commentary on how the Foreign Service has changed and
                    quite frankly at the end of two years in personnel, I knew that I wanted
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any difference between the attitude, the
                        performance, the expectations of the women coming in and the men at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: The only thing I noticed was the women were probably marginally more
                    aggressive. I won't say marginally, they were more aggressive than the men. They
                    were much more prone to naked ambition or demonstrating it than were the men.
                    The men were still a little better at hiding some of it but the women were by
                    and large much more determined. Maybe that is a reflection on society too, I
                    don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the minorities, was this an issue or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yeah it was an issue and we had a woman, a civil servant GS officer in
                    CDA, whose job was to shepherd these guys and girls around and make sure that
                    they weren't getting screwed by the system. I think by and large it was working
                    well. I think we were by and large getting good minorities, not totally. Of
                    course there are always the ones that weren't suited for the work and it was
                    always because of racism, it wasn't because they weren't suited for the work.
                    Most of them I think were pretty good officers that we were bringing in. We
                    weren't bringing in all that many. There were some Hispanics and some blacks and
                    some Asians but not in big numbers. We were bringing in a lot better quality of
                    minority officers than we were before. In my previous session we talked about my
                    brief experience, my four months killing time on the Board of Examiners when we
                    were getting the results of the people who had come in under the system of
                    bypassing the exam system. They would bring these people in for five years then
                    bring them up for review on whether they should be tenured or not. We had some
                    real losers in that crop. I think bringing them in through the exam system was
                    the way to do it. You might get fewer than you might otherwise want because the
                    smart guys are going to go off to work for GM or something. They were pretty
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any special care taken for first assignments for
                        a minority officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Not on my watch. I tried to make our system as color blind as I could.
                    You can say that is bad because some people we say we've got to give these
                    people more of what they want. I would say that is not helping them. What you
                    have to do is just treat everybody equal. Basically when we made the
                    assignments, I would check over all assignments. I tried not to know who on the
                    assignment list was black, who was white, who was Hispanic and whatever. I
                    always made a point of asking why are we assigning Ms. Jones here? I never heard
                    we are assigning Ms. Jones because Ms. Jones is black and wants to go there. It
                    was Ms. Jones is being assigned for very good reasons and Mr. Smith over here is
                    going for very good reasons. No, we didn't while I was there. Maybe some would
                    argue that I should have, I don't know but we didn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '94, what then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I came over here to this wonderful campus and studied the six week
                    economic course because I always wanted to take it. Then I did some refresher
                    Japanese language training here and in January of '95 I went out to Yokohama for
                    more refresher Japanese language training. In the summer of '95 I left Yokohama
                    and went to Sapporo Japan as principal officer up there and stayed there until
                    December of '96 when I decided that it was time for me to do something else with
                    my life and quit. I am one of the few white male 01 political officers who quit
                    rather than had their clock run out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about Sapporo. To identify it, it's the principal
                        city of Hokkaido isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Yes, it's the principal city of Hokkaido. It is where the Hokkaido
                    administrative apparatus is. It is like the capital. The consular district
                    included the northern part of Honshu as well. I think the consular district was
                    something like 27 percent of the land area of Japan or something like that. It
                    is quite extensive, quite large. Hokkaido was an interesting place. I think it
                    has 22 percent of the land area of Japan and it's got something like five
                    percent of the population. It is thinly populated with beautiful forests. It is
                    actually a beautiful country. Dairy farming and fishing are big up there. Coal
                    mining is gone now. It is mainly agriculture. Some of it is rice because they
                    grow rice everywhere in Japan but there are a lot of potatoes and onions and
                    sort of western crops are grown there plus it is a big dairy area, the dairy
                    capital of Japan. It's like our Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues? What was the situation there when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>GIBSON: It was all pretty calm and easy, kind of boring. It was actually the most
                    boring job that I had in the Foreign Service. We had a beautiful facility
                    occupied one half by the USIS branch office and we had the other half. Actually
                    USIS had most of the building because they had an auditorium, library and that
                    sort of thing. It was a very nice facility. Then there was us. The USIS thing
                    got closed down after I left actually.</p>
                <p>The main job that we had on the State side was trade promotion and that was
                    basically our job. Our military would go up there and we'd do exercises with the
                    Japanese self defense forces and that sort of thing. Every now and then there
                    would be an incident up on the disputed area between Japan and Russia which we'd
                    report on. We would also report a little bit on far eastern Russian
                    developments, trade relations with Japan. Basically it was trade promotion. We
                    were helping U.S. companies selling to Japanese companies. Our biggest market
                    was building materials. In Hokkaido, because they had more space, there tended
                    to be more western style homes built and two-by-four construction as opposed to
                    post and beam construction which the Japanese had traditionally used.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Oregon, Washington and the Canadians too were selling a lot in there and
                    so were the Swedes and various Scandinavians. The Australians were making a good
                    effort too. Throughout northern Japan, northern Honshu and on Hokkaido, as I
                    said two-by-four style construction was flourishing and our companies would sell
                    better quality building materials shipped from the west coast to Japan and we
                    could beat local Japanese prices.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: That's right we did but you just keep plugging away at it. Tokyo was
                    handling most of that. Tokyo was fighting that battle. All we were doing was we
                    were cheering Tokyo on and if we got a particularly egregious case we would
                    report it to the embassy and then they would use it in their negotiations with
                    the Japanese. Certain things we were doing okay in and certain things we
                    weren't. Wiring and plumbing, forget it. They had that one sewed up. The
                    Japanese had all these little regulations on wiring and plumbing and stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can draw up things so that you only have to use
                        certain types of piping and wiring.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>GIBSON: We were chipping away at it. We were doing real well on stuff like timber
                    and on things like drywall, fiberboard, basic construction materials. Yes, it
                    all had to be passed and this and that and everything. You know, you beat on the
                    Japanese long enough, they give grudgingly with two steps forward, one step back
                    but then you just keep pounding on them. We were working at it.</p>
                <p>I think what we were trying to do was get a U.S. share of major construction
                    projects. The biggest one that was going on there was the city of Sapporo was
                    building a new stadium for the World Cup in 2000 or whatever it was going to be.
                    We knew it was an uphill fight but we did a lot of lobbying with Sapporo
                    officials and everything to get American companies to get a good shot at it. We
                    knew we wouldn't get an American contractor in there, that would never happen.
                    But we were working very hard to get an American engineering firm to have a role
                    in there. As I understand after I left it came down that way. It started out as
                    an American engineering firm and I think the Brits bought it out but it is still
                    largely American in many ways I guess.</p>
                <p>We were also doing pretty well in selling electricity producing things like
                    generators and that sort of thing to the local electric companies because the
                    utilities in Japan are under increasing pressure to become more cost effective
                    and so they were looking for better ways to do it. We were having some success
                    in that area and we were having some success with computer and high tech stuff.
                    Other things surprisingly enough were helicopters. The various prefectures in
                    Japan and major cities were on the kick of buying emergency helicopters, rescue
                    helicopters for medics and that sort of thing. We had some pretty good luck
                    selling Bell helicopters to the city of Sapporo and the province, state,
                    whatever you want to call it, of Hokkaido and some of the other cities down in
                    the northern Honshu area. But that is basically what we did. I spent a lot of my
                    time doing trade shows. We would do trade shows both in Sapporo and in Sendi
                    which is the commercial center of northeastern Japan, the Tohoku area they call
                    it. We were doing okay. We did pretty well. I was quite please with the
                    performance of the guys doing that but basically that was all we did. No one
                    cared about anything else up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about with trade and all, I would have thought that
                        Wisconsin or Minnesota, you mentioned dairy, might be pretty good sending
                        trade delegations there and all of that or maybe Idaho potatoes or something
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: We got strawberries but not potatoes because Hokkaido grew plenty of
                    potatoes and quite good ones. Wisconsin didn't participate. You take dairy
                    farming at their own place, there is no way you can beat them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of equipment or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Oh yeah, the dairy farming equipment, milking equipment and a lot of that
                    stuff was American, very heavily American made stuff was there. But you know it
                    is funny because I guess what was going on is the dairy industry in Hokkaido was
                    consolidating while I was there and a lot of people were selling their farms and
                    there were fewer and fewer farms and this sort of thing. Mom and dad would
                    retire and Sally and Joey didn't want to be on the farm, they wanted to be in
                    the city and they had left. When I would visit dairy farms you would see
                    American milking equipment and various other things which I've sort of forgotten
                    because I don't know anything about farming anyway. There would be Ford tractors
                    and all this stuff. You would see a lot of American made equipment but we
                    weren't at the time really engaged in selling them which told me that it was
                    sort of a maintenance job. There was a local Ford rep. It had sort of gone on
                    its own and it didn't really need any consulate intervention, trade boost and
                    this sort of thing. I think that it was probably because it was a very stable
                    market, or a shrinking market if anything. You are right. Our stuff was being
                    used over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the last time that you were in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: Last month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I'm talking about a tour before this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: It had been '86 (if you count language school) to '89 in Okinawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any change in the Japanese? Up in that area
                        were they more internationally oriented? Was there a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: First of all I can't really say if there was a change and I'll tell you
                    why. Okinawans are Okinawans, they are not mainland Japanese. Hokkaido people
                    are not your average Japanese because Hokkaido is settled. It was a frontier
                    area as late as the turn of the century so the people who went up to Hokkaido
                    came from all parts of Japan so they are much more open and less closed than the
                    people from the main islands of Japan. They are not really representative of the
                    Japanese either. I found the Hokkaido folks in general to be much more open,
                    easier to talk to. Not easy but easier than most Japanese. Yes there is a very
                    high interest in international things like music festivals, and Sapporo is
                    building a world trade center. They would have exchanges with the Northern
                    (tier) Group, countries that basically are at the top of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kind of cold.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>GIBSON: Yeah, kind of cold, the Scandinavian countries, Russia, Canada, U.S.
                    through Alaska. They are constantly having meetings and conferences. Hokkaido
                    and Sapporo are really good on dragging in international things. At the
                    universities there they have a lot of sister school relationships with U.S.,
                    Australian, Russian, Chinese universities. Sister city programs are very
                    popular. All of this, as there is toing and froing and this sort of thing, and
                    does it make a real impact on the psyche of the average Japanese citizen in
                    Hokkaido? No. They go through all the motions and everything, they are doing all
                    this. My friends and I, the cynics that we are, we would always say the Japanese
                    wouldn't know kokusaika if it bit them in the ankle. Kokusaika is the Japanese
                    term for internationalization. They don't get it but they are trying real
                    hard.</p>
                <p>They had a program in Japan called JET program, I think it means Japan English
                    Teaching or something like that. It is a government sponsored thing. Young
                    Americans or other nationalities too go to Japan and some of them teach English
                    in the schools and some of them they put in the city or the provincial
                    administrative offices and they handle these international programs. In every
                    province, (I use the term province. It's multidimensional, they are not even all
                    the same in Japan but they are province like things for cities and all the major
                    cities) they all have international programs and in the city there will be an
                    international department. You know how exploded the bureaucracy in Japan is, so
                    they've got all this tax money and they sponsor these. A great many of them have
                    these foreign kids there. You meet some real nice young Americans, I met mainly
                    Americans of course. Anyway they are very interested and the people of Hokkaido
                    more so than most I think.</p>
                <p>Hokkaido is basically a colony of mainland Japan. The Japanese sort of see them
                    as the provider of milk, cheese, potatoes, onions and a market for their
                    manufactured goods and this sort of thing. Very few Japanese companies will go
                    up there and locate. The Hokkaido crowd are always trying to get foreign
                    companies to come and invest in Hokkaido but they won't because transportation
                    costs between the mainland and Hokkaido are prohibitive. The government
                    regulates everything and won't give a break on airline fares, telephone calls.
                    They won't give them a break on anything so they pay outlandish fees.</p>
                <p>I'll give you an example of internal transportation and why factories won't
                    locate in Hokkaido. You can ship a standard sea-land container of goods from say
                    to Seattle to Yokohama Japan for x number of dollars. At Yokohama you put it on
                    a ship to bring it up to a port in Hokkaido on the Pacific coast, we're not
                    talking about the Sea of Japan side, we're talking about the Pacific coast. It
                    will be 2x dollars. It will cost you twice as much to ship it internally and if
                    you try to do it by road, it is going to be the same thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>I used to love the internal phone thing. My wife was over here in the States
                    while I was there, that was one of the reasons that I didn't do the full tour. I
                    would call her, as I did most nights. The embassy has this tie line back to this
                    area so once I got to the embassy operator my telephone call to Virginia was
                    free but the thing that limited our phone conversations was I had to pay the
                    phone bill between Sapporo and Tokyo. It wasn't quite as bad as her calling me
                    direct from here but it wasn't much cheaper. It was cheaper but not much.
                    Anyway, nobody wants to locate up in Hokkaido and the Hokkaidan people are
                    always pressuring the government to give them a break on this or that.
                    Everything is regulated so if the government bureaucrats want to, they could
                    make the long distance rates cheaper. It gets in the way of telegraph, e-mail,
                    it affects everything up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the dispute over the northern territory with what used
                        to be the Soviet Union and is now Russia, intrude at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: No, occasionally. The Japanese poached a lot in those islands. Their
                    fishermen would go up there and start poaching and the Russians don't mess
                    around. A patrol boat would go in and warn them a couple of times and if they
                    didn't smartly get out of the waters or heave to for arrest, they'd shoot them.
                    They would just open fire. There were a couple incidents where machine gun holes
                    in the cabin and this sort of thing and boats would be arrested. In every case
                    the Japanese were in the wrong. The Russians were in the right in the sense that
                    they were protecting their territorial limits. You may not agree with their
                    territorial limits because you may say that that's an island that really belongs
                    to Japan, but not so. The islands we're talking about are right here where
                    they've got a sort of hatch there. They would be around usually right around in
                    this area just off Hokkaido. But sometimes they would be up here off Sakhalin
                    and Sakhalin is not disputed. The Japanese were poaching. There would be
                    occasional incidents but it would always be played down.</p>
                <p>If you went up to that area of Hokkaido, the We Want Our Northern Territories
                    Back movement or whatever, was really strong. They have museums there and they
                    have road signs along the road which the Japanese right wing would have up
                    showing basically Russian soldiers bayoneting nice Japanese babies on the
                    islands, that sort of thing. It was really just funny propaganda. I used to take
                    snapshots of the big signboards. You get away from there and nobody much cares,
                    it's a dead issue. They are god forsaken islands and who wants them? At the
                    museum they have a lot of historical photographs of Japanese families and
                    workers. There is nothing up there. They are barren, cold, isolated and nobody
                    in their right mind lives there. In fact the population has drained because once
                    the Soviet Union broke down, the Russians don't have to stay there any more and
                    they are heading back. There have been some earthquakes that have destroyed a
                    lot. Nobody wants to live there, even the Russians don't want to live there, and
                    there are no Japanese left there. They all were sent back down to the mainland
                    and so nobody really cares except for these old codgers up there, the right
                    wing.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>A few years ago the Russians and the Japanese agreed to a system whereby several
                    times a year without bothering with visas and everything, the Japanese can go up
                    there and visit the ancestral graves. That took a lot of the wind out of it too.
                    I think it is sort of the thing, oh yeah well great grandfather Hashimoto he is
                    buried up there. That is great, you stay there Hashimoto-San and I'll stay down
                    on Hokkaido where it's a lot nicer. It was a big Cold War issue at one
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very handy thing for the old Cold War. It kept
                        the Japanese from playing footsie with the Soviets. It was stupidity on the
                        part of the Soviets but anyway it was their stupidity and not ours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: What is interesting now is if you took a poll in Hokkaido, 90 percent of
                    the people in Hokkaido would say let Japanese businesses invest in those islands
                    because there are plenty of Japanese businesses that would like to invest in
                    construction on those islands or in a fish canning processing plants and this
                    sort of a thing. They see it as an opportunity for some profit but the Foreign
                    Ministry won't let them because if the Japanese invest there, they have to get
                    Russian permission which implies that it is Russian territory, and so on, and so
                    on. The Hokkaidans are always pounding on Tokyo to the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs saying hey, forget that let's just do a deal, but Tokyo won't do it. The
                    people of Hokkaido they don't care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired in '96. Could you just give me a brief idea of
                        what you've been up to since then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GIBSON: I retired and immediately, didn't miss a pay period, went to work half
                    time for a drug policy think tank in Washington D.C. I did that through '97 and
                    a little bit into this year. I did two six month contracts with them. The
                    project I was working on was starting up some sort of a drug prevention
                    education pilot project in Burma. The final thing after we got it I was
                    negotiating it, we got it all arranged and everything, the potential funders in
                    the United States backed out, so that is finished. I've done three stints with
                    the OSCE, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe as an election
                    monitor, twice in Bosnia and once in Armenia. I've been working on my book. I am
                    writing a book on the KMT armies, the former nationalist Chinese armies that
                    went into Burma as you know. Starting August 1, I am going over for a six month
                    contract with OSCE to Croatia and I am going to head up one of their field
                    offices there in the eastern Slovenia area. I find retirement very pleasant. I
                    work just enough to earn a few extra bucks and retirement gives me the
