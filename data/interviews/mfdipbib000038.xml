                <p>FRANKLIN H. BAKER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: William D. Morgan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 22, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>SUMMARY: Frank Baker is a member of a select group of United States government
                    employees: for nearly twenty years he was the principle State Department
                    official responsible for controlling all the quota numbers assigned to intending
                    immigrants destined to our country. Far from an interview with a statistician,
                    let along a green-eyeshaded bureaucrat, Mr. Baker recounts story after story of
                    what was behind congressional intent (or lack of it) and the execution by the
                    executive branch of the Federal government of the numerical controls on
                    immigrant visa applicants. He knew Abba Schwartz well and relates many
                    heart-warming and personal anecdotes of the latter's days directing the State
                    Department's consular affairs. Most helpfully, Mr. Baker walks the reader
                    carefully and in great detail through all the principal elements of the visa
                    laws from 1952 to present...and with considerable personal reflections and
                    opinions. You will end up knowing, for better or worse, the real heart of the
                    American visa quota system, and many first-hand accounts of what went on behind
                    the scenes as American migration evolved over the last forty-plus years.</p>
                <p>BIOGRAPHY: Frank Baker has lived most of his life in the Washington D.C. area. He
                    joined the Department of State in 1946 in a clerical position in the Visa Office
                    of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs. He then moved on to
                    progressively more responsible position until he soon assumed the position of
                    the officer in charge of numerical control of the immigrant visa operations.
                    Over his man years in that job he was given additional responsibilities,
                    including administrative control of the visa lookout system. Mr. Baker retired
                    in 1978, but was called back for a several years to help out in new pressures
                    that his old office were called upon to meet. He no maintains his interest in
                    knowledge about visa matters as a consultant to clients needing to call on his
                    extensive insights into visa adjudication.</p>

                <p>INTERVIEW: This interview is part of the Abba Schwartz foundation grant, devoted
                    largely to the subject of migration to the United States. Of particular concern
                    in this interview are those individuals who came in immigrant status and were
                    subject to the quota control system. The quota allocations, as viewed over the
                    years, have changed extensively, but behind the numerical limitations placed by
                    congress on immigrants was the perceived need to restrict or expand the number
                    of legal immigrants for geographical, racial, economic or family reunification
                    reasons. The quotas imposed, or not, simply implemented quantitatively
                    immigration policies at the time. There is one man who for years administered
                    for the entire government this quota control: Frank Baker. Employed by the Visa
                    Office of the Department of State (where by law rests the quota control
                    operation), Mr. Baker, now in retirement, gave over 32 years to its service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frank, it's a great pleasure to have you share with us
                        some of your experiences. How about starting off by telling us how you came
                        to the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: O.K., well first Bill I'd like to let you know that it is a distinct honor
                    and pleasure that you selected me to participate in this program, on behalf of
                    my late good friend, Abba Schwartz. I will try to give you my best insights on
                    the visa functions, and a few experiences I've had over my 30 odd years in the
                    Visa Office. First, I took a 90 day temporary appointment with the Visa Office
                    in June of '46. This followed my World War II service in the Navy. At that time,
                    jobs were hard to find, and I had a friend who was a courier in the State
                    Department, and he happened to know the Personnel Officer. And, he put this
                    Personnel Officer on to me, and which I got the 90 day temporary appointment.
                    Well I ended up retiring in 1978, after a long, prosperous and good career in
                    the Visa Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend all that time in the Visa Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I spent the entire time in the Visa Office. I was in the Foreign Service
                    Personnel system, although I never served at a Foreign Service post. I might add
                    that when I came to the Visa Office to work as a clerk, at $1,020 a year, $20.00
                    a week...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1020 is $1,020 a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, $1,020 a year, $20.00 a week, I didn't know what a visa was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us what a visa was, and that's the first thing you
                        learned, I take it. What did you discover a visa was in 1946?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it was a permit issued by the United States to permit you to enter
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As immigrants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This is stamped on your passport, which is a passport issued by your
                    country, to let you travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is for immigrants and non-immigrants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Immigrants and non-immigrants. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in 1946, we didn't have the number of immigrants we
                        have today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, we had the national origin quota system at that time, which was
                    approximately a 152,000 per year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who sets that figure, Frank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This was set by congress, and they decided that number should be one-sixth
                    of one percent of the 1920 census, related to the national origin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they pick that involuted, to me, formula.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I assume that there were conservatives and liberals, and the
                    conservatives won out, and that time they wanted our immigration to come from
                    the countries that gave us the most nationals before the quota system was
                    set.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So these are mostly Europeans back in the 1920's...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: For example, the British quota was 65,000 odd. The Irish quota was 17,000.
                    The Italian quota was 5,666.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the tilt was more to the Anglos.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BAKER: Northern Europe. The WASP as you would know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you think that was the reason, was to tilt the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Tilt the immigration, yes. And, ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said conservative. In what sense do you mean
                        conservatives? These were people who wanted to keep our country pure? Is
                        that what you mean? (Laugh)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think so, yes. Really, that's my personal feeling, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think some historians might be able to prove that to
                        you, too. (Laugh)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right. (Laugh)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's what the figure was, and when was that set in
                        1940...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it was set in the 1924 Act, and then was carried over into the '52
                    Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '52 was the big, the main...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The McCarran-Walter Act. Pat McCarran from Nevada, Francis Walter from
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was under President Truman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This was not under President Truman. He vetoed the bill, and it was
                    overridden by congress by a big majority. However, President Truman was
                    vindicated thirteen years later when the '65 law came into effect, that
                    abolished the national origin's quota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Truman vetoed it because he did not want this racist, if
                        you will, or tilted immigration bill, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the main reason, as I understand it, was the quota system. The
                    majority of countries had a quota of one hundred per year. And, at that time, we
                    had what they called the barred zones. The Indians, the Asiatic, the Chinese,
                    were unable to become citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't even part of the one hundred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: They were part of the one hundred, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that each country, other than this northern European,
                        was given only one hundred. One hundred per year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. For example, the Philippines, Japan, had a hundred eighty
                    five quota. China had a hundred and five. There were two quotas for China. One
                    for the non-Chinese, which was one hundred per year. This included mostly
                    missionaries that served in China, and may have had children born there. They
                    came under the quota of one hundred. Then the Chinese quota was one hundred and
                    five, which was exclusively for the natives of China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was true in say, Latin America, as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well in Latin American, no. Then there was non-quota for that particular
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were no quotas, no numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No quotas for the western hemisphere applicants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Canada being part...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Canada, and all of the Central and South America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had no quotas, but how did you get into the United States
                        as an immigrant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, you qualified, that you were physically, mentally morally and
                    politically straight. And, there were no quotas, and you qualified on paper,
                    either with an affidavit support, or job offer, or invitation to come to the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds rather easy the for western hemisphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it in fact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: It was, in fact, except for the Mexicans, where, because of the
                    administrative backlog. We didn't have the personnel to serve all the applicants
                    that wanted to obtain visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you telling us that because we didn't have staff,
                        people didn't get immigrant visas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, there was somewhat a defacto quota for the Mexicans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I would have thought that somebody would have taken
                        this to congress and say...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, congress was aware of it, and they went along with the idea that,
                    even though the western hemisphere was the non-quota area, we should restrict

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: An administrative waiting list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, for heaven's sakes. And that had some basis in
                        law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No basis in law, whatsoever.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just everybody agreed to do it?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was no Mexican lobby out there, obviously. Well,
                        just pause for a moment on the Mexicans. People coming in
                        illegally—wetbacks—I suppose we had them in the '40's and '50's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's true, the Mexicans did cross the border illegally, because
                    there was a five to ten year wait on the processing of their immigrant visa
                    applications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they just crossed over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I might add, too, at this time, that there always has been a lot of talk
                    about millions of Mexican illegals. What they don't realize is that the number
                    of illegals that come in, are the same illegals that go back each day. They are
                    counted each day as illegals, but they're never counted or subtracted from that
                    list when they go back. They come and go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they come, come, come, but statistically, they never

                <p>BAKER: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means that our statistics on them are a little bit

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I do remind the reader that the man behind the
                        numbers, again, is Frank Baker. He not only is reading off these numbers now
                        without any reference to notes, but he managed all the numbers of the quota
                        system, and also all of the statistical reports to congress. Every year, for
                        example, we have an annual accounting, we must give to congress, and Frank
                        is the one responsible for making sure those numbers jive. And I'm not sure
                        how he counted the Mexicans that came and went, but ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, of course, there was no way of counting the illegals, but (laugh)
                    people made estimates as to the numbers that might be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't mentioned this yet, but certainly the reader
                        knows that our sister service, the other part of adjudicating immigration to
                        the United States, is the Immigration and Nationality Service, INS. And,
                        INS, of course, is responsible for any alien at the border, and after he or
                        she enters the U.S. They're the ones that keep an eye on illegals.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back into the period, prior to 1965, picking up the
                        period under the 1952 law—vetoed by President Truman, and overridden—this
                        was the period when the quota was racially biased, but also when congress
                        added strong anti-communist conditions on entry into the U.S. The so-called
                        McCarthy period. How did that, if at all, affect you Frank? Or were you able
                        to hide behind your numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, actually I didn't come in contact with that. I was on the
                    quantitative end, and the communist aspect was on the qualitative end. I know
                    that there was quite a turmoil within the Department, but fortunately for me, I
                    never got involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you didn't directly, but you were there working with
                        colleagues who were involved. Did you have any impressions of those days
                        prior to the '65 Act, under the McCarran Act?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, there was a great push by the immigration and nationality lawyers
                    and other groups to change this law. But nobody knew exactly how it should be
                    changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or maybe dared change it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: It could have been both. The lobbyists didn't start working on this
                    problem until, I would say, 1960, or thereabouts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did Abba Schwartz join the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Abba Schwartz came to the Department under President John F. Kennedy. He
                    was appointed some time after the president's election.</p>
                <p>BAKER: One or two years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One or two. All right, so we're talking Abba Schwartz'
                        arrival prior to the '65 Act, but, while the McCarran Act is...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Still in effect, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, so prior to Abba Schwartz' arrival, and prior
                        to this effective change in the law, do you have any comments about some of
                        the leaders that were around that time in the State Department or the Visa
                        Office? Do you have any insights, or were you too far down the pecking order
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, to be truthful with you, I was too far down the pecking line. I
                    never got to the superiors on top, unless I went up five or six levels within
                    the Visa Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have some good levels then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: We had some good ones, and we had some bad ones. (laugh)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were mostly foreign service, or civil service
                        combined?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: All of the chiefs of the Visa Office were Foreign Service officers, and
                    today, I think that is still in effect. Every Chief of the Visa Office, or
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary, as the title is now, was a Foreign Service
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: O.K. So you had some good leaders, and some not so good
                        ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Some good ones, and some very weak ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you move from a clerk's job into quota
                        control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I assumed the job of quota control in the early '60's although I had
                    worked there under the supervisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in charge of quota control before you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Under the '52 Act, it was a lady by the name of Viola E. Curry. Q: So you
                    learned from her?</p>
                <p>BAKER: I learned from her. I learned from the cohorts that I worked with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many were you, in the quota control at that period,
                        say, in the mid 50's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BAKER: Five people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did it without computers? You did it without maybe
                        even typewriters? Tell us something about the “green books”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, those were the old pen and quill days! And we had ledgers, of course,
                    each country, foreign state country, had a limit of the number of visas that
                    could be issued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us how the process worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the system was set up where they had four preference categories. The
                    first preference was for highly trained and skilled technicians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a certain percentage of the total quota for that
                        country, went for that category.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. That's right; 50 percent. It was fifty percent of the particular
                    country's quota. The first preference was entitled to fifty percent of the
                    quota. In other words, if there was a quota of one hundred, fifty numbers would
                    go to the first preference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And those numbers included the whole family. One number
                        for the whole family, or each member of the family counted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Each member of the family was charged against the quota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, now back to the remainder of each quota. What
                        about the remaining percent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Thirty percent to the parents and unmarried sons and daughters of U.S.
                    citizens. And twenty percent to spouses and children of resident aliens. So that
                    took your hundred percent, and should any numbers have been left over from the
                    first three, they would go to the fourth preference, which consisted of brothers
                    and sisters of citizens, but only one-half of the fall down. The other half of
                    the fall down went to the non-preference applicants who did not qualify for any
                    of the preference categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was fall down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's pretty hard on a hundred numbers a year, isn't it?
                        Not many brothers and sisters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, most of the minimum quotas of one hundred were oversubscribed, and
                    the second and third preference categories; nothing remained for the fourth and
                    non-preference categories. And, as a result of this, there was no so called,
                    “new seed” from those countries that were oversubscribed in three preference
                    categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get these numbers? Did they come by mail, from
                        the different posts? Did you have a little green book that you kept at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: We made our allotments based upon the monthly reports from the foreign
                    service posts around the world. They consisted of the number of registrations.
                    By: 1) foreign state chargeability; 2), by preference category; and 3) by
                    registration date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a monthly report that came into you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Based upon these monthly reports, we would tally the demand, by country,
                    by preference, and by registration date. You would know by the count if the
                    demand exceeded the limit allowed by law, and if so this was what we called an
                    oversubscribed country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most countries were, I would think were
                        oversubscribed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Many countries were oversubscribed. We had a few countries that weren't
                    and what we called current quotas. In other words, the demand was less than the
                    supply. It was a simple matter of supply and demand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't imagine any country that wouldn't have a demand
                        that was more than the number supply.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, for example, Great Britain had a quota of 65,000, they only used
                    about 30,000 a year. The Irish had a quota of 17 some odd thousand, and they
                    only used about eight or nine thousand numbers a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is not the case today.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BAKER: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you couldn't pass those numbers on to some other
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No. And, whatever numbers were not used, were just lost for that fiscal
                    year. Now the old law of immigration, at that time, as far as the quantitative
                    controls were concerned, amounted to about a hundred thousand immigrants a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the non-quota, that would be South Americans. Was
                        there any other non-quota besides the western hemisphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, non-quota were the spouses and children of citizens who were not
                    charged against a quota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: O.K. So anyone who married an American could come in
                        without any reference to the numbers. And that still is the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. That's still the case, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. And then, technically speaking, you literally
                        just had log books so when you got in these reports...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: We had log books, and as I say, the pen and quill, and we entered each
                    allotment in the books. We had books set up for each quota. We entered into
                    these books, the number of allotments, the preference categories, the posts they
                    went to..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I envisage that maybe some of our newly appointed junior
                        officers out in the field, and maybe some less well-trained foreign service
                        nationals—to use the vernacular—screwed up some of these reports from time
                        to time. How did you deal with the field on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, there were screw ups from time to time, but I might say that there
                    were very few. For example, when the applicant became documentarily qualified,
                    he notified the post. The post, for some reason or another, overlooked this
                    applicant, and failed to put his registration, priority date, or preference
                    date, on the demand for numbers. Nine times out of ten we would hear from them,
                    hear about that from his relatives, his lawyers, his congressman, what have you!
                    And we would straighten it out, one way or the other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Then you had enough flexibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: If we couldn't take care of it that particular month, we make sure it was
                    the first thing we did the next month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really had the whole fiscal year to work in. To
                        make up for any slippage like this. But come the end of the fiscal year,
                        that was it. BAKER: Yes. Now we did this administratively by allocating ten
                        percent of the annual quota each month. Of course, as you say we had twelve
                        months. How did you get a hundred and twenty percent. Well, we did this for
                        ten months, and as things would have it, some of these numbers would go
                        unused during a particular month, and they were returned to us to put back
                        into the tally, and we used these unused numbers, or return numbers during
                        the last two months of the fiscal year.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And, on an oversubscribed quota, sometimes we had to fish for posts to use
                    up the quota.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this with telegraphs going around and telephone calls
                        like we have today, or was it by mail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Most of it was by air pouch: we used telegrams, and in emergency cases,
                    we'd use the phone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, if you have no more comments about back in
                        those 1952 days, Frank, then lets bring Abba Schwartz on board, via the
                        Kennedy administration's election. BAKER: Yes, well my association with Abba
                        Schwartz began in the early '60's, after he was appointed by John F.
                        Kennedy, to the State Department as the Administrator of the Bureau of
                        Security and Consular Affairs. It was somewhat funny how we became
                        associated with one another. I found him to be a persistent and demanding
                        man, in that he wanted action without all the bureaucratic double talk that
                        he was facing from some of his underlings, where he felt he was getting
                        nowhere fast with the mandate from the President to revise the immigration
                        law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mandate was there. The President knew about it, and
                        wanted a change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: He knew about it, and wanted a change. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Schwartz' principal assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: He didn't understand the quota system of 1952, that we were then operating
                    under, and asked his immediate underlings to explain such. He met with little
                    success, I suppose, and somehow got a hold of me, who at the time was somewhat
                    far down the ladder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, when you say underlings, you are referring
                        to the director of the Visa Office, and the deputies and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, and the General Counsel, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of all these layers he finally discovered there was a
                        Frank Baker. But were you then in charge of quota control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a good foundation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. Anyway, I guess my first confrontation turned out O.K., because he
                    continued to call me with certain questions about the visa functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his first question for you? Why did he call you,
                        Frank?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BAKER: He called me and said, “How in the hell does this system work? And what
                    are your viewpoints on it?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on the phone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, he called me up personally. And, I might say, that was my first
                    meeting with the Administrator of Security and Consular Affairs, and I was a
                    little nervous about the whole situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was his immediate predecessor, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: A fellow named Bontempo, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bontempo. And he wasn't there to long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, he wasn't there too long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had never had any contact with any Administrator.
                        The director of the Visa Office was the highest person you've ever dealt
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And I had very few contacts with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe they didn't know what you were doing? Or maybe they
                        didn't want to know. (laughs) Well, the thing, if I may suggest having had
                        the deputy director job, if Frank doesn't make waves and is doing the job
                        right, then leave him alone. If you are not being questioned by congressman,
                        and so on, then why bother Frank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But all of a sudden, we have a new Administrator that is
                        bothered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: So, anyway, one day he called me into his office and said that an attorney
                    he knew in New York called about a man and wife in Tel Aviv, who were invited to
                    a big wedding in New York City, and were being held up because of the lack of an
                    affidavit of support for their NIV's.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Non-immigrant visas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Non-immigrant visas. This was on a Wednesday, and the wedding was to take
                    place on Saturday. The attorney said he couldn't possibly get the affidavit
                    there on time for their scheduled flight. Abba, asked what he should do to help
                    this family. Of course, I was in his office, and I asked, could I use your phone
                    to call Tel Aviv, and he said sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is when you were called over on immigrant quota
                        matters; all of a sudden it was a non-immigrant matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No this was subsequent to my first encounter with him. And he had this
                    problem, and instead of going to his immediate underlings, he called me on this
                    non-immigrant problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was not normal for the work you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. And I said, “Abba, I...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're already 'Abba' with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I said, “Mr. Schwartz, I'm not too familiar with the non-immigrants but I
                    know a little bit about it. And I said, “If you don't mind, I'll call Tel Aviv,
                    and see what we can do.” So he said, sure go ahead. I got the non-immigrant
                    officer on the phone, and fortunately he remembered this specific case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fortunately for him! (laugh)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And the consular officer said that he would require an affidavit before
                    issuing NIV's. I explained to the consular officer that this was somewhat of a
                    humanitarian request, that they had round trip tickets, proof of jobs, with
                    property ownership in Tel Aviv...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And good connections in New York!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And good connections in New York, and wanted to stay in New York for two
                    weeks. He insisted on the affidavit until I told him, “when was the last time
                    you ever saw a Jew on welfare?” (Laughs) There was silence, and Abba Schwartz
                    roared. I can still hear him laughing. And the consular officer said, “Frank I
                    guess you're right.” Needless to say, the NIV's were issued in time for them to
                    attend the wedding. (laughs)</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Abba was forever grateful for that assistance, and we remained friends
                    until his death. After he left the Department, he called on me on a regular
                    basis, and he and I, after my retirement, consulted with each other on
                    individual immigration cases that he relentlessly pursued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Abba Schwartz do after he retired, in what, 1964?
                        What did he do, go into immigration work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. Well, he wrote a book, he took a lot of time writing a book entitled,
                    “Open Society”.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: More about the flow of immigration, and his stint and tenure in the State

                    it should do and how to select the new immigrants to come to the United States.
                    And, there were suggestions made by the Immigration and Nationality lawyers,
                    lobbyists, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the National Catholic Welfare
                    Conference, and other organizations, interested in immigration.</p>

                    and, of course, Teddy Kennedy was on the Senate Immigration subcommittee. And
                    these two committees got together and came up with a proposal, of the selection
                    system to be used, should this law be passed. And it consisted of six different
                    preference categories. By abolishing the national quotas, the system would be
                    set out as twenty percent for first preference, unmarried sons and daughters of
                    US citizens. Twenty percent, and the amount unused by the first preference, for
                    the spouses and children of the resident aliens, ten percent to the third
                    preference for professionals, such as doctors, lawyers...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the first point where an occupation came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Occupation, yes, right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The previous law, it was only family. Now we have
                        identified a need for certain skills for which we're in short supply in the
                        United States, supposedly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, short of or needed in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that pushed by labor unions? No. Who pushed that, who
                        was interested in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I think mostly the immigration and nationality lawyers were
                    responsible for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were pressures from abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: There were pressures from abroad. Because most of these people were on,
                    what they call a non-preference category, and there was nothing available for
                    them to immigrate at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was the first that we have, of people needed in
                        the United States for their skills, and what was that the fourth
                        preference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, third preference, and it was strictly ten percent. No fall down from
                    the first two preferences. The fourth preference consisted of twenty percent,
                    and that was the married sons and daughters of citizens. And it included their
                    children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's new from the old law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, and that included also, any fall down from the first three preference
                    categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that job, third preference, was kept aside and held to
                        ten percent. O.K.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes. And the fifth preference category consisted of brothers
                    and sisters of citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably the most debatable. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They said some brothers and sisters end up not talking
                        together; how far can they immigrate together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, so anyway, they were entitled to 24 percent, and plus any fall down
                    from the first, second, third and fourth preferences. And, then the sixth
                    preference category consisted of a small percentage, only ten percent plus any
                    fall down from the first five preferences. And, that was for the skilled and
                    unskilled workers in short supply. And then, the remaining six percent was for
                    refugees. The non-preference category belonged to everyone who couldn't meet the
                    preference criteria, and they qualified on the basis of their registration date
                    with the Foreign Service post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they couldn't, for example, work. They couldn't come
                        into the United States to be employed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Oh, yes. They were the ones who couldn't qualify for a preference
                    category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though they didn't fall under any of the
                        categories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. And, they used the unused portions from the first six preference
                    categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If there was anything left. And in the beginning, there
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And in the beginning there was. Yes, we had non-preference immigration. In
                    the beginning, the '65 Act, I failed to mention, had an annual limit of 170,00
                    per year for Europe, Asiatic and non- western hemisphere countries. And this
                    annual limit was used, for the most part, by the preference categories. And a
                    goodly percentage for the non-preference, where the preferences were current,
                    and those numbers would flow down to the non-preference categories. For example,
                    Great Britain and Ireland never fully used their quotas and the majority of
                    immigrants from these countries used the non-preference category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But something I think we forgot to tell the reader. The
                        old, per country, quota has now been wiped out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BAKER: Abolished. Yes, by the 1965 Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we have 20,000 per country!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: We have 20,00 limit per country. Within the preference selection system,
                    we have a 20,000 maximum for any one country. All applicants now with each other
                    on a preference and registration date regardless of the country of their birth,
                    up to the maximum of 20,000 per year for any one country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this probably, talking about Kennedy's wishes and Abba
                        Schwartz' mandate, probably was the most important thing that they wanted
                        changed. Is that right? The inequity by nationality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. I believe they wanted an open society, as his book was
                    titled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now you've got both the quality of the new
                        immigrants, and the quantity changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: During the initial stages of the '65 Act, we were able to take care of
                    most of our visa applicants, as our preference categories were current, and
                    stayed current, for the most part until somewhere in '78 or '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the exception of western hemisphere, then this new
                        law took care of any of the backups, any of the administrative waiting
                        lists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did so for ten years, am I hearing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's right. Just about ten years. Yes. In other words, we had a
                    waiting list for the Italians, which numbered somewhere over a hundred thousand.
                    And, this backlog was cleared up within a ten year period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, really to belabor the point, with the exception of the
                        western hemisphere, every immigrant who wished to come to the United States
                        and who's qualified, came.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BAKER: Just about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we had no pressures on us. We had no complaints from
                        interested groups or individuals, even congress, I mean, congress didn't
                        ride your back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe a few individuals did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: A few individual cases, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since congress is omnipotent, in terms of constitutional
                        interpretation of the right to change these laws, did you find yourself with
                        individual congressman trying to pressure you, from time to time? To, how
                        shall we say, juggle the numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, we did have quite a few requests from their staff aides, which were
                    pushing visa cases, for expediting and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Expediting versus ignore the numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. In other words, if a category was oversubscribed, and we
                    were issuing to applicants, say for example who were registered prior to January
                    1, 1965, and this applicant that they were interested in had a priority date of
                    January 1966, there was just nothing that we could do. To issue that visa, would
                    have been illegal, and that's something that we never tolerated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you held.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: We held fast to it, and we had the law to back us up on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any examples of a few congressman that might
                        have tried something else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, in '52 we had a problem with Wayne Hayes from Ohio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wayne had a very strong voice in the State Department
                        affairs, in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He controlled our budget, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, he was a budget man. (laughs) And he was pushing a Czech case, and of
                    course, the Czechoslovakian quota was oversubscribed at that time, and there was
                    no way within the law that the visa could have been issued to her, outside the
                    limitation. However, after going into the case, and doing some research, we
                    found out that she may have been entitled to non-quota status as a returning
                    resident alien.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had lived in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: She had lived in the United States before, went back to Germany, got
                    caught there in World War II, and then fled to Czechoslovakia and then she was
                    caught there after World War II. So she was having a problem, actually of not
                    immigrating to the United States, but of emigrating from these countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had been in motion!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes. So Wayne Hayes called down and figured we weren't acting too
                    fast on the case, and raised all kind of hell with us. Finally, we got the case
                    solved, and the gal came in as a returning resident alien, not requiring a visa
                    number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it took you to say, “Yes, it's legal, and, you're
                        going to have to do it the way we're going to do it.” Despite Wayne
                        Hayes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes. I might add that Wayne Hayes ended up later on with a
                    lot of trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he did. And there wasn't a person in the State
                        Department that didn't cheer. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes. And, right after the passage of the '65 Act, we were called
                    upon the Hill to testify before the Immigration subcommittee. There was a member
                    of the committee, Arch Moore, congressman from West Virginia, who was hot on
                    some third preference cases. And he felt he wasn't getting enough action, or
                    speedily action on those cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We remind the reader, third preference was that small ten
                        percent for specially skilled individuals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Specially skilled individuals. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming for a job, in other words.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: In order to qualify for that, you had to have a labor certification, and
                    in addition to that, you had to have a petition filed. Well, the labor
                    certification approval would take two to three months. Then, in turn the visa
                    petition would take another two or three months for processing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for it to flow through the bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's correct. Then, the codicil of the visa petition, would take another
                    two or three months with the Immigration Service. And then it would take another
                    month in travel to the foreign service post. And then it would take another
                    month or two to process the case at the foreign service post. So, Arch Moore
                    wasn't too happy with this. And he said these people are not given the proper
                    priority date. So I explained to him that the priority date was established
                    based upon the filing of the labor certification, regardless of when the
                    petition was filed. He didn't believe me, because he said that he was over in
                    London, and got some information from the consular officials over there that it
                    was the petition filing date, rather than the labor filing date. He said, “you
                    have to straighten it out.” And I said, well, I tried to explain to him that the
                    labor certification and the petition would go hand in hand, and the applicant
                    would be given the benefit of the earlier date. Anyway, he said I didn't know
                    what I was talking about, and I said well since I can't satisfy you, there's no
                    use of discussing it further. And he ordered me out of the hearing room.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were actually in the hearing? Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. I was testifying. And I might add that Arch Moore came upon
                    hard times later when he was Governor of West Virginia. And was indicted for
                    some shenanigans that he carried on when he was Governor of West Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Morally, you better treat those underlings properly! Or
                        we'll get ya! (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: So, I felt that I was vindicated in both cases.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But those are the rare exceptions, usually congressmen
                        knew that the law was clear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes. And we got along very well with the staff aides. When
                    we told then it could be done, they thanked us, and when we told them it
                    couldn't be done, they thanked us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, in most cases, the staff, the congressmen are calling
                        on the behalf of the constituents. Somebody who lives in that district who
                        needs help.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I'm told that the Visa Office has the largest number
                        of queries from congress of any element in the State Department—because we
                        can provide help to a constituent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And that's because, you know, this majority of congressmen, they know
                    about immigration, but they're not up to date on the ins and outs. The various
                    controls, the various restrictions, and the various qualitative standards that
                    all of the applicants have to meet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm hearing from you, as was my own experience, that most
                        members of congress are perfectly sane, sound people. And if you give them
                        the answers that they can pass on to their constituents, they're happy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it's the old adage, that if your responsive, they're satisfied. They
                    want an answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Abba Schwartz learned that early, fortunately for him.
                        (laughs) Because you had the answers, and you weren't defensive, and you
                        weren't going to break laws. At the same time, you knew every law has a
                        degree of interpretation, and you did that. Back to Abba Schwartz' reign, or
                        his period there: tell us about the period between his coming on board and
                        the 1965 Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: He did a good job I thought as the Administrator of the Bureau of Security
                    and Consulate Affairs. He wanted to liberalize, somewhat, some of the
                    qualitative standards set out in law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example?</hi>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BAKER: For example, a well known individual was invited to come here and speak
                    before a college or group or convention, and there was some question about his
                    ties to the communist party, or some other party or some other ideals, that
                    didn't see eye to eye with the administration at the time, he wanted them to be
                    able to travel and come over and explain their views to the American people. Now
                    some of those, in, people in our advisory opinions group, that rendered opinions
                    on some of the these decisions, as to whether or not the fellow should be able
                    to immigrate, he didn't quite go along with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of those things that comes to my memory, is Mr.
                        Auerbach. Frank Auerbach, who tended to be a very strict, perhaps
                        protective, since he himself was an immigrant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe like many of the immigrants, it takes a second
                        generation before they begin to want equal treatment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I might say, that he, Abba Schwartz, and Mr. Auerbach didn't see eye to
                    eye, but I thought both of them were great people. The had their own views, they
                    were entitled to their own views, and they spoke out on their own views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were intelligent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And were intelligent. And, as I say, they were both great people. But Abba
                    Schwartz was in control, so he called the shots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Auerbach's position at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: He was deputy director of the Visa Office. He worked under usually a
                    Foreign Service officer, FSO-1.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Auerbach was a civil service employee?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been an interesting time to watch these
                        various contrary elements in the society itself, as well as in a microcosm
                        in your own Visa Office. Watching the different pressure groups, and
                        ideological tendencies, with the newly elected President but the congress
                        still widely varied interests. Some of very conservative, I suppose, were
                        pressing to keep out people. Also, the old act of '52 was largely against
                        communist association and, within reason communist governments. The '65 Act,
                        however, still had the same exclusion of communists. Didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, it did. That's under section 212(a)28 of the 1965 Immigration and
                    Nationality Act. And it's still there today, despite the end of the cold
                    war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The post Schwartz era involved Len Walentynowicz and Barbara Watson.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I didn't have any dealings with Barbara Watson or Len Walentynowicz.
                    My few experiences with them, I found them to be very fine people. However, they
                    had their own group that they were surrounded by. I wasn't ostracized, as such,

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I had a few roles to play, but on one of them, they didn't listen to
                    me and they got burned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This was the Cuban Refugee Relief Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This was prior to '65, a law was passed. At that time, the Cubans,
                    together with all the other western hemispheres, were in non-quota status. When
                    the '65 Act came into being, and the annual limit of 120,000 was placed upon
                    those countries, no limit to any one particular country, but all of them
                    competed among themselves for the 120,00 slots. This Cuban law was on the
                    books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, let me just confirm this. All countries, Canada,
                        Mexico, Central America and South America, all had no limitation by the
                        individual country, such as the rest of the world did, but had a total for
                        the two hemispheres of 120,000 annually. And all they did was get in line,
                        and meet the same criteria as before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: O.K. The same qualitative inadmissibility questions as for
                        the rest of the world. The only question was quotas per country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: There was a total number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: O.K. And then Cubans were off there becoming
                        communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, this law dealt with the Cubans that were in the United States, and
                    got here by hook or crook.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to Castro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Subsequent to Castro. This law dealt with the Cuban adjustment program. To
                    adjust these Cubans to resident status, from no status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were in a non-status, so to speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: From no status at all since most of them were paroled into the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the legal way that immigration could put an
                        umbrella over them of some sort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This law was in effect, and when the 120,000 limit came up, there was much
                    wrangling whether or not to charge these Cuban adjustees against the 120,000
                    limit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 'Cause, after all, Cuba is one of the countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes. Now I took the stand that they should not charge them against
                    the limit, simply because the immigration law which they were going to adjust
                    under, was similar to the Hungarian Freedom Fighters law, which did not require
                    a visa number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The similarity being these people fled from a communist
                        controlled country. The Cubans found themselves in the United States and
                        needed to be legitimized. Where, in the case of Hungary...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The law itself was somewhat verbatim to the Hungarian law, except that it
                    mentioned the Cubans, rather than the Hungarians. So at that time those dealing
                    with immigration, with their finger in the dike mentality, wanted to keep people
                    out, and wanted to charge them to the 120,000 limit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say those people in immigration, you mean the
                        INS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: INS. Yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BAKER: You might say, with the exception of the General Counsel. The General
                    Counsel sided with me. That they should not be charged to the quota limit.</p>
                <p>

                        say. He was a lawyer who saw the parallel you saw, and said you must treat
                        one situation like another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right. So, anyway....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just ask, numbers. How many Cubans are we talking
                        about and how many Hungarians are we talking about, roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 100,000 Hungarians, and the
                    Cubans, as it turned out, measured some 240,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking just large numbers, comparable
                        numbers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in any event...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: In any event, the decision was made after Ray Farrell, the commissioner of
                    Immigration at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: He was the commissioner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position on this issue? What did he think
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I really don't know what he thought, but my understanding is that he cut a
                    deal with Everett Dirksen, the noted Senator from Illinois, and they decided to
                    charge them against the 120,000 limit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we remind the reader, it's congress that makes
                        these decisions, not only writes the laws, but may enter into some decision
                        making within the law.</hi>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BAKER: But, in this case, it was congress who wrote the law, but the Immigration,
                    and the State Department made the decision that the law would call for charging
                    the numbers. An administrative decision was made by both parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the law was not explicit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Because the law was not explicit. And we continued to do these Cuban
                    adjustments, subtracting each one from the 120,000 annual limit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the State Department also felt the way INS did, that
                        they should be charged against western hemisphere. Except you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I don't know how they really felt, but I told them to not charge them
                    against the 120,000 limit. But they went along with the INS decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dirksen was getting involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever asked to give your opinion to, say, Barbara

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I gave it to her, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, evidently she didn't take it because she went along with the INS
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she explain why to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No. So anyway we were instructed to charge these Cuban adjustees. Every
                    Cuban adjustee from the INS came into the Visa Control Section, and we marked
                    each one off, and sent the numbers back to INS.</p>
                <p>

                        roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000 per year. And the final
                    total was 244 odd thousand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Adjusted and subtracted from the western hemisphere?</hi>

                <p>BAKER: Adjusted from the western hemisphere, over a period of, until '78 or '79.
                    Yes, '79. And then some bright lawyers and organizations got together and sued
                    the State Department for using these numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sued the State Department, in a sense because you were
                        responsible for the core of the control, not the INS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes. They sued the State Department for us using the numbers from
                    the 120,000 limit. And, needless to say, after much testimony back and forth,
                    and in the courts for two or three years, the judge finally decided for the
                    plaintiff, and instructed the Department of State to restore these 244,000
                    numbers, and redistribute them among the western hemisphere applicants, who were
                    then on an oversubscribed waiting list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you took these 244,000 numbers and gave them back to
                        all these people that were waiting, because there wasn't a number

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it started in 1980, the Silva Program, as we called it, because the
                    lead plaintiff—it was a class action suit—was Jose Silva.</p>

                <p>BAKER: Some of them had given up hope, some of them had died, some of them

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: So the court instructed the State Department to redistribute these numbers
                    over a period of two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's not too unreasonable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And it was somewhat ironic, I was retired at the time, that they called me
                    back to administer the Silva Program. And, fortunately we finished it within the
                    two year span, and everybody was satisfied.</p>

                        demanded a tremendous drain on resources because you just don't adjudicate
                        240,000 immigrant visas applications with the staff you've got. We had to
                        hire...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, there was a lot of retired people who were called back to duty.
                    Clerical staff was hired, and so forth.</p>

                <p>BAKER: Posts such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Mexico City, the three immigrant

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: They all had to return to their own countries to obtain visas. There was
                    no adjustment of status for the western hemisphere at that time, except Cubans.
                    They had to go back and pick up the visas. During my contract days with the

                        had some contact, obviously. Did you find them, from your own vantage point,
                        good leaders of the Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, they were good leaders. Especially Barbara Watson. She was a good

                        began to vanish. In fact, a few relatively modern devices began to come in.
                        And I can't think of a place that needed such support than in your area.
                        Tell us about computerization, and mechanization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, we tried to computerize for many years. But, unfortunately and I
                    couldn't see eye to eye, simply because the system that they suggested would be
                    more cumbersome than what we had.</p>

                <p>BAKER: They were contract people and they were computer people on the civil
                    service end of the Department. And not until 1980, when I was back on contract,
                    did they come up with a system that was compatible to everyone that was
                    involved. Both them and us.</p>

                <p>BAKER: Yes. That's right. And during that time of my contract, we were able to
                    computerize the system.</p>

                    concerned, the Foreign State code was concerned, the priority date was
                    concerned. There was too many errors. And, the people, the only people that
                    could punch the cards, or hired, were the GS-1's and the GS-2's [lowest

                    where you could punch it in yourself, see what you got, and you had the machine

                <p>BAKER: And this worked out fine. Because every time you'd get a report, instead
                    of stacking them up, and doing them on pen and quill, or punching a card, you
                    could enter this information right into the computer, the same way the report
                    came in.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That doesn't sound like quota control at all!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, even though I was Visa Control, that was one of my ancillary jobs, the
                    Visa Lookout book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And why did they give you that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: It came under the Operations Branch, but for some reason or another, the
                    personnel director at that time put it under my management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you better tell the reader a little bit about the
                        Lookout program. It sounds like kind of an ominous thing. You want to just
                        give us a little summary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the Lookout System consisted of the names of all aliens that are
                    ineligible for immigration, based on the qualitative standards of the law. In
                    other words, if the post in Palermo knows of a mafia man that kills somebody,
                    then his name, date and place of birth would go into the Lookout System, under
                    terrorist, or otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The person didn't have to be refused a visa to be put into
                        the Lookout System?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What it was, was a list of people, that were either
                        ineligible, known to be, or suspected to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's right. Yes. And this was an alert to the consulate offices.
                    Every applicant that applied for a visa had his name searched through the
                    Lookout book, and now it's on the computer system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that Lookout list, the blacklist, if you will, had
                        been going on for years, I've been told.</hi>

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BAKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was updated, from time to time, purged perhaps? Or
                        maybe not! (laugh) Once a man died he probably wasn't purged!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes. No, there was some purging done on the lesser problems
                    with the aliens, such as a non-bona fide non-immigrant, [section] 214(b) [of the
                    1965 Act]. His name was put in there when he was refused a non-immigrant
                    visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But maybe only stayed in there .....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Within a year or two, his name was purged, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now all of that was done mechanically, just like the quota
                        system. The name was typed into long lists; I guess the first
                        “modernization” was the microfiche. Tell us about what that is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the microfiche consisted of a listing of all the names in the
                    Lookout System, ...sort of an index or library, if you will, that the post would
                    use on these microfiche machines. Rather than looking through a big log, or
                    ledger, they'd look through these microfiches. If the name was Bill Morgan,
                    they'd go directly to the M's and see if Bill Morgan's name was in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And go slowly blind, as the hours went by. But this was
                        considered to be a faster way. And, maybe a more updated way? How often did
                        they send new microfiches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Once a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once a month. So that's fairly good. But you could skip
                        through if you went quickly from one post to the other, maybe? It was a hole
                        in the Lookout System.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, now you went from microfiche and books to
                        computer systems? When did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That happened sometime in the '80s, after I'd gone.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you were responsible for keeping it up to date,
                        and so on. It was still a book as well as a microfiche. Frank, since you've
                        retired, the inevitable congressional and administration desires have been
                        manifest in ever-changing existing laws, namely the 1991 Act. I understand,
                        as a matter of fact, that congressmen are so fed up with changes in the law,
                        that they never want to see another change in the Immigration Law, ever! We
                        know that won't be the case. But, even though you haven't had direct
                        involvement with these recent bills, give us your summary views of what you
                        understand are the principal changes to immigration law since you left, say
                        over the last ten years, certainly since the 1965 Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The biggest change, well actually it wasn't a change, but the biggest law
                    was the Amnesty Act, which granted amnesty to all the illegals, and this Act
                    came on board after much debate, pro and con, because actually no one knew just
                    how many applicants it would entail. And, there were estimates anywhere from
                    five to ten million that would compete in this, and how would they handle it
                    with the staff that they had on hand at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal motives: sense of uncontrollable
                        numbers of illegal aliens in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: With no control over them, and they were growing in numbers and the
                    proponents of the bill, advised congress that these people were already absorbed
                    in our communities, and they were not displacing the American citizens from
                    jobs, to the contrary, they were helping our economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were largely Mexicans, and Central Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes. And, there were a few Canadians, also. But the majority
                    were Mexicans, and Central and South Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were, in our terms, illegally here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's right. Without any status, and undocumented as the word
                    goes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Misused by employers, perhaps, exploited, scared?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. Now the opponents of the bill estimated that they'd be some
                    ten million of these that would come forward. And finally the bill was passed,
                    and the results was no where near the estimate that the majority of the people
                    thought would qualify under this bill. And, it set out to relieve thousands of
                    people from a worried mind, from a worried job, worried family unit, and gave
                    them legal status. It was just like releasing them from jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What time period are we talking about? Is this
                        mid-80's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: This was in the mid-80's. Yes. I was retired at the time, and I was doing
                    immigration consulting work. And I helped some 15 or 20 applicants become
                    regularized under this Amnesty Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the terms of being regularized? What did you
                        have to be to get such a status?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, you had to be here before 1980, and you had to prove to the
                    immigration service that you lived continuously here for that period of time,
                    until the time of application.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you couldn't go back to Mexico to see your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, that's right, yes. There was a waiver of that of 30 to 60 days, if
                    you were out of the country for 30 to 60 days, that wouldn't count. But, as a
                    result of it, I think there was close to 5 million applicants that qualified
                    under this Amnesty Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the usual terms of inadmissibility applicable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes there were the qualitative terms of the law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was no quota. Obviously it didn't apply.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, no quota, and the law was administered completely by the
                    Immigration Service. There were separate offices set up at the district offices
                    for the Amnesty Program, and the applicants had to qualify at that spot.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it really didn't affect the State Department, except
                        certain tangential foreign policy issues, but it basically was in INS. But
                        it was, as you say, an important change in immigration policy, that had been
                        perking over the years because of the dissatisfaction of knowing illegals
                        were here, and having employers be a part of it, and misusing them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it was a success?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think it was a success. Yes. Very much so. And, of course, it did not
                    interrupt our economy, it related the family units, it helped the applicants
                    quite a bit who were having difficulties with employers, who were not paying the
                    proper wages, giving the proper housing or anything else, that they were
                    entitled to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you understand that the controls through the employer
                        are working? That people, in fact, are doing it correctly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, at this stage of the game, I think they are, yes. And then after that
                    we had what we called the lottery game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doesn't sound like much of a State Department foreign
                        policy question!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, this was for the applicants who were born in a country that
                    were...shut off when the national origins quota system was abolished. Such as,
                    British, Irish, Italian, a number of people that were affected when the '65 Law
                    went into effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example, the British dropped from 65,000 to
                        20,000?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Less than that, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that, they were disadvantaged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's what congress contends. That they were disadvantaged by
                    instead of 30,000 people coming from Great Britain, only 10,000 could come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Only 10,000! Why did it not drop to 20,000?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, there was only 10,000 that qualified, when they competed with
                    everyone else around the world!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see, it's again the competition with the rest of the
                        world. So that the British might have 20,000, but they didn't have 20,000. I
                        see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That was their cap at 20,000, but the number of British that might come
                    in, depending upon how well they competed with the other foreign states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of people coming to retire, so they were
                        disadvantaged, congress thought? Is that what stimulated this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand it's the Irish, too played a part in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, Irish, too played a big part in it. In fact, out of the first
                    lottery, I think about 50 percent of the 40,000 numbers went to the Irish. Q:
                    Your tossing around these numbers leads me to believe that even though you
                    weren't directly involved you certainly know what happened. BAKER: Well, being a
                    consultant on immigration, I try to keep my hand in. I had close contact with
                    Seton Stapleton, who succeeded me in Visa Control, and he kept me up to date on
                    all the comings and goings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in summary, how did they reach these levels of
                        numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, congress passed a bill for 40,000 in the lottery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they come to 40,000, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I don't know how they arrived at that figure. It may have been a
                    compilation of visas that were not used by these countries, during the period of
                    a pro-rata basis, which probably was the reason they came to that quota.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Albania? Oh, because they couldn't get out of the country
                        to emigrate! BAKER: Argentina was another one, and so forth. But these
                        applicants were picked on a first-come-first-served basis. And the lottery
                        started on a certain day, and the priority date consisted on the postmark on
                        the envelope.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you, as an Argentine, know what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: All of this information was assimilated by the foreign service posts, and
                    publicized in the public papers, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the word spread, obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And the word spread.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did approach, for example, people who had not been able
                        previously to get visas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No we didn't. No, we just publicized that fact that this lottery was open.
                    Anybody who wanted to participate in it had to send a letter in by such and such
                    date, up to a closing date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whether they had applied for a visa, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Or whether they were on the waiting list, or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, only from those 20 countries, or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Only from those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they had to submit a ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: All they had to submit was their name, date, place of birth, their
                    address, and the foreign service post that they would apply, if they were
                    picked. Q: If they were picked, then did they have to become qualified, in the
                    sense of did they have to have a labor certificate, or relatives, or what?
                    BAKER: No labor certificate, or no relative was involved. All they had to do was
                    qualify on the qualitative standards of the law. Physically, mentally, and
                    politically. So that, if they, a job was not involved, but they had to prove
                    that they were not going to become a public charge. So, therefore, they probably
                    either had to have a job, or a sponsor that would guarantee of them not becoming
                    public charges. One way of overcoming that, was a job offer. Now this is true,
                    in the two lotteries—the one lottery that was just completed and the new one
                    that's coming up next fiscal year which starts October 1, 1993.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there will there be many annual lotteries; did the law
                        call for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, so far there's been two, and the third one is coming up.</p>

                <p>BAKER: And that's it for the time being, yes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the time being. (laughs) In a sense, you think
                        there'll be more lotteries. But the law itself merely covers only three
                        lotteries, period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Three lotteries, that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this supposedly brings equity to those that were
                        disadvantaged. Every Irish bartender in Boston is taken care of.
                        (laugh)</hi>

                <p>BAKER: Every New York Irish cop is taken care of. (laughs)</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, so far through the grapevine, and being an immigration consultant, I
                    filed quite a few for these applicants, and there was no cap on the number of
                    applications that you could file. They were merely picked from, at random, by a
                    computer. So, on all my applicants, I filed twenty applications, each, and every
                    one of them in the first go around were picked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: On the second go round, I was lucky on only two out of ten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's just by the numbers. Absolutely. Well, of
                        course, if you picked an Irishman to file for, the chances were much better,
                        because 50 percent went to the Irish, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, unfortunately, I didn't have any Irish applicants. It was Japanese,
                    British, Canadians, and..</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now. These people filed these letters, and they went
                        into the Visa Office, as letters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: They went into a sub-office, a contractor for the visa office did this and
                    computerized everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Computerized in the sense that they input all the data and
                        then threw them up into a selection system.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And, then the computer went through and picked each one of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And nobody has challenged that yet? No lawyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Nobody has challenged it. They all seem to be happy, because evidentially
                    40,000 slots take care of a goodly amount of applicants that were applying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, when they finally got around to their
                        applications, I assume, some got refused. So I suppose it was 40,000 plus,
                        with replacement numbers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes. Of the 40,000 that weren't chosen, maybe at the end of
                    the fiscal year, you had about 5,000 numbers left over, then they would choose
                    5,000 more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would argue, Frank, that when you and I worked together,
                        some decade or so ago, if you had ever proposed to me or I to you, that
                        there would be immigrant visas issued on the basis of a lottery, we would
                        have laughed each other around the room for the next decade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: We'd have both retired sooner, too! (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somehow the concept of a lottery, to come into this
                        country... well, enough of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, this goes with the 1990's, I guess. With all of the states having
                    these lotteries for a million dollars, you know, and...they picked up on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have too much respect for the immigration process. I
                        think I do? (laughs) But now, what's the next major change in the law?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the Reform Act of 1990, which added some 90,000 more numbers of
                    slots a year to the Immigration Law of 290,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that is the law that is now in effect? It increase the
                        quantity? BAKER: It increased the quantity, and revised, somewhat, the
                        percentages going to different categories, and mainly it changed the
                        selection system for the new seed applicants, such as the doctor or the
                        nurse or the engineer.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New seed? You want to tell us what that means?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: In other words, no relations to American citizens or resident aliens.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like a relative plants a seed! Oh, dear!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Because immigration begets immigration! Yes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we call it new seed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: New seed! And the workers, I don't know exactly what their percentage is,
                    but the categories for the doctors, dentists, nurse, anybody with a high degree,
                    is in a current category, and numbers are immediately available for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you understand, motivated this increase in skills?
                        What brought this about? Here we are out of work, we've got a shortage,
                        we've got professional people looking for jobs!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I don't know what motivated it, but I'm sure the immigration and
                    nationality lawyers were behind this—because they're the ones who get the
                    biggest fees from it! (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, yes, all of that aside, you still have to convince
                        not only congress but labor unions, professional groups; everyone agreed
                        with this. Is that right?</hi>

                <p>BAKER: It may have been, for all I know, but I just can't give you an answer for

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, the bottom line is they have increased the number of

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the assumption that we're able to absorb more, and the fact that
                    this Amnesty Bill came along, and took care of five million.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But didn't take care of the number that we thought it

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, right. And it didn't hurt us one way or the other. And here's the

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. They get their percentage allowed by law, and the rest of them,
                    according to the registration dates, have to wait their turn. And then the
                    fourth preference is for the brothers and sisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that's what the old fifth preference was, brothers and
                        sisters, and the same numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: There's a backlog, yes, the same number, and there's a backlog of about a
                    10 year wait on that category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's many a person who says they should wait

                <p>BAKER: And then separate and distinct from that, come the worker's category,
                    which is current on all categories.</p>

                        two, three categories, which consist of those people with high degrees,
                        bachelor's, Ph.D.'s and so forth. Those in the work force such as nurses,
                        engineers, others, that's current. And then the latter categories, skilled
                        or unskilled in short supply. That category is still oversubscribed by about
                        five or six years.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is more than it has been. Behind that delay is labor
                        certification needed for third category. The first two categories need no

                <p>BAKER: No, there's labor certification on all of them.</p>
                <p>BAKER: On all three? Formerly, the skilled person—the doctor, for example—didn't

                <p>BAKER: Qualitative control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Qualitative control. Let's pause there for a moment, and
                        talk about the two principal other agencies that are affected here.
                        Concerning input into decision-making, let's talk first about the Labor
                        department and then INS. Labor measures the employment and unemployment
                        around the United States. How do you look, in your experience, at how the
                        Labor Department managed this particular issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, frankly, Bill, I don't know much about the Labor Department, and I
                    will say, that 90 percent of the labor certifications that are filed, are
                    approved. Now, the only ones that they disapprove, I think, are the affected
                    areas, where there's high unemployment. Such as might be West Virginia, for
                    example, or parts of Kentucky, or...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is one purpose of labor certification. Just don't go
                        out giving jobs to people when you've got unemployed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Their main thrust, or reason for the labor certification, is it will not
                    displace some American citizens from a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your feeling of this, does it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I think it's working, but I think it's just another step in paper
                    shuffling, because they approve 90 percent of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But approval means that we need that person in the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that sounds fair. So that paper shuffling, well if it
                        weren't for this screening, this paper shuffling, there would be no stopping
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: What I'm trying to say is that the labor certification, if it weren't
                    necessary, you could approve it based upon a petition, and documents submitted
                    by a particular individual, showing his background, education, and what his
                    career is, and his skills and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a visa officer in Bujumbura you couldn't be certain
                        about the job opportunities in West Virginia. So you'd get a list saying, we
                        don't need anybody in West Virginia. What you're saying is you think it
                        could be done without Labor Department certification, simply by the INS and
                        the visa officer adjudicating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Since 90 percent of them are approved, I think it's...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You see that as possible? Not these days of
                        unemployment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Not in this day and age, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about INS now. What are your overall views of our
                        sister service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it's a good system, INS and visa [adjudications]; it's what we
                    always referred to as the double check system, to get your visa from the
                    American consular officer and then at port of entry you're inspected again and
                    make sure that you meet all the qualitative controls. At the port of entry I
                    think, INS does a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under tremendous pressures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The central offices of the district, not the central but the district
                    offices, are responsible for approving petitions, the adjustment of status,
                    deportation and picking up illegal aliens, and so forth. I think they do a good
                    job, also, but there are some offices, in relation to others, whether they're
                    inundated with work or they're understaffed, I don't know which. But they take
                    too long in adjudicating petitions, they take too long in adjudicating
                    naturalization petitions. For example, I took a Canadian couple over in April of
                    this year, for naturalization. They met all the requirements. The young lady at
                    the counter accepted all the documents. Said everything was in order. “But you
                    have to wait until April of '93 before we can give you an appointment for an
                    interview for citizenship.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No particular reason other than that they're backlogged. If they're
                    backlogged all this much, it would appear to me that there should be staff to go
                    around, somewhere. And consistent with that of Baltimore, I know for a fact that
                    in New York it only takes three to six months to get your naturalization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: So it might be management, it might be leadership, or what. But my
                    workings with the Immigration Service, have come up with the idea that the
                    majority of the immigration officers have police mentality and their finger in
                    the dike mentality, again, stopping this flow of immigration. They're not as
                    gracious and nice and polite as those in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that is endemic to the nature of the immigration
                        service. Of course, we do know that it's a split service. Some are law
                        enforcement, others are adjudicators. Visa officers are only adjudicators.
                        We are not trained to be law enforcement officers. That means we carry out
                        the law, but we are not cops, if you will. We're certainly not troubled with
                        the border patrol problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The majority of the [INS] adjudicators act like law enforcement
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe they were. A lot, we know, have not had a
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: It may be the training they get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. Tell me what you understand is the type of
                        training they get? Do you know, is it effective? Obviously it isn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I don't know anything about the training that they get, Bill. I know that
                    each applicant has a certain right to apply to immigration. They have no right
                    to treat them like third or fourth rate citizens. Even though they are
                    aliens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not even though. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If it weren't for aliens, INS wouldn't have a
                        business!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's correct, yes. The many fees that they have on all these
                    applications, and the high price and the increase of such fees recently, would
                    lead me to believe that they are somewhat able to subsidize their own operations
                    with all these fees, and they should have adequate staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the fees are levied—I went through this with the
                        visa fees—based upon how much it costs to produce the service. INS faces the
                        same thing as we do, namely, our services are so labor intensive and
                        performed under pressure. Computers sure help. We have discovered tremendous
                        assistance that computers give us in the whole consular field. INS doesn't
                        seem to have computers that work to it's advantage as effectively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, they don't. In fact, they have the I-94 card for everybody that comes
                    into the United States, that's filled in at the port of entry. And I don't
                    believe if you searched anywhere in the Immigration Service, they would come up
                    with the number of people that are in the United States right now, on
                    non-immigrant visas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that must be discouraging to the professional INS

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, not at the present time, I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we ask you to sum up, Frank, are there any
                        other things we haven't touched on that you'd like to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BAKER: I'd just like to mention that the visa/immigration system has come a long
                    way since the '52 Act, which was enacted over President Truman's veto. The '65
                    Immigration Law was revised with the abolishment of the national origin quota.
                    This was a great tribute to Abba Schwartz who worked so diligently with
                    congress, and somewhat set in motion a fair system of selecting who our
                    immigrants would be. And I have a suggestion if they ever change the law again.
                    The Reform Act of 1990 revised, to some extent, the system and increased the
                    overall limit by approximately 90,000 per year. To my way of thinking, this is a
                    fair law, but not the fairest of all systems. An example: the law gives
                    unmarried sons and daughters 21 years of age and over, as defined, of citizens
                    first preference of 23,000 slots a year. And married sons and daughters of
                    citizens, third preference of 23,000 slots a year. This, to me, is somewhat of a
                    farce. Because a son or daughter is just that. Whether they're married or not.
                    And they should be given the same status, or the non-quota status which will not
                    delay the inevitable. The first preference category is currently available
                    except for Mexico and the Philippines. And the third is slightly oversubscribed
                    for all countries. But these applicants will be processed in a year or two,
                    anyway. So, why make them wait. Why delay the inevitable? In this particular
                    time, both Republicans and Democrats alike, are stressing family ties, and
                    family unity. What's wrong with an immigration law, stressing the same
                    sentiments? If such were done, you could allot these 46,000 slots saved to the
                    brothers and sisters of adult citizens, in the hopelessly oversubscribed fourth
                    preference category. It would go along way to reunite families, and give some
                    hope that these brothers and sisters can eventually reach their dream of
                    immigrating to the good old USA, instead of vegetating on the waiting list for
                    ten years or more. If we can't absorb them in our communities, then we shouldn't
                    tease them with saying you can immigrate in another ten years. If anyone in
                    congress happens to hear this, let's get with it and right a great wrong that
                    has been with us for the last forty years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I hear ,Frank, is “do away with any quota

                <p>BAKER: Well, eventually, it's 46,000. Eventually these people are going to get

                        because of the numbers. Why do we have a quota system on relatives of

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, because we always did it that way. Abba Schwartz
                        wouldn't agree with that!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, and it was incorporated into the '52 Act, and it's been carried
                    forward ever since! And nobody, I think, has the insight, or cares one way or
                    the other, whether...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you've got the numbers!</hi>

                <p>BAKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know that we're talking about, no more than 50,000
                        people. And you know that the mathematics say, it will increase as more
                        American citizens can bring over relatives. But we're not talking about huge
                        hoards of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. That's correct!</p>

                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, there should be a limitation. I don't think I'm not advocating a
                    free ride at all. But I'm stressing justice for what might be those who are
                    caught in a catch 22 situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you are talking about, for example, a worker. If he
                        appears to the consular officer qualified, based on the facts he shows,
                        you're telling me he is going to be approved 90% of the time anyway. So, it
                        looks like we have an enormous system out there...hit the mouse with an
                        elephant. Have I misinterpreted this? Is our immigration system aimed at the
                        wrong controls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think it's sort of slanted, yes, Bill. Q: We're afraid of being
                    inundated, because we have golden streets, in many people's minds. And we
                    understand why the Ethiopian desperately needs to get to some place.</p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ignoring the refugee part of the immigration system, you
                        feel the process is still antiquated. Inequitable. And impracticable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Am I putting words in your mouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: You're putting the right words in, yes. The fact that this, just this
                    change of these two categories, would go a long way to clear up a lot of
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there's no hope of that today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, I don't think so.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other ideas do you have on future immigration?
                        Sweeping, general, or specific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: There's another section in the law that I would like to address, which
                    I've never had a part of, the non- immigrant section of the law. And that is
                    Section 214 (B), which states all applicants for visas shall be deemed to be
                    immigrants unless proven otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Better know as the Napoleonic Law. Guilty until proven
                        innocent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, in other words, these applicants are guilty until proven innocent,
                    which is contrary to our basic democratic philosophy, that all souls are
                    innocent until proven guilty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gee, I took the words out of your mouth! (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. I don't think there's any need for this kind of rule, in our
                    immigration policy, and the decision to determine who or who is not a potential
                    visitor, should be left to the issuing officer, who with the use of common
                    sense, should be able to determine the bona fides of applicants based upon the
                    facts presented. This section of law, I think, is used as a crutch for many
                    offices, who with their finger in the dike mentality, believe that the USA will
                    be overrun with illegal aliens, and are unable, for the most part, to make
                    reasonable and equitable decisions. Take a look at our refusal statistics, and
                    you will see what I mean. One and a half million were refused in 1990. I am sure
                    that in this group. there were many bona fide applicants that will never have
                    the chance of visiting the USA. Again, I'm not advocating a free ride to all,
                    but am stressing justice for those who might happen to be in a catch 22
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me supplement that by not only agreeing with you but
                        putting myself in the role of the visa officer it would remove some of the
                        tremendous anguish, frustration, anger that goes through the visa officer
                        when faced with this requirement. Battles between colleagues, and so on, all
                        because we're under a Napoleonic law. But we seem to be in agreement on
                        this, Frank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes. I think that section of law should be eradicated
                    forthwith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Done! Frank, you've given some explicit recommended
                        changes to the law, any other points that you want to make about where we're
                        going in the way of immigration to the United States, or not going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BAKER: I don't have any comments, one way or the other on that, Bill, but I'd
                    like to say that I feel somewhat responsible for a few changes in the
                    immigration law. I made comments before on suggestions, and changes to the
                    immigration law. And, fortunately a few of them were made. For example, In late
                    '70, before I retired, I was requested by the director of the Visa Office, then
                    Julio Arias, to appear before an audience of mothers who were interested in
                    adopting foreign children. Of course, being a Visa Control officer, I didn't
                    know the first thing about adoptions. But he gave me enough time, where I could
                    do some research on this. And, I took with me about ten bills that congress had
                    introduced on the adoption of orphans. At that time, there was a limit of two
                    children to be adopted by American families. No more than two children. And, I
                    looked at that, and I said, “I think this is crazy!” There were ten bills which
                    were introduced to remove that restriction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the individual laws.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's right. On the individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are relief bills.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. And they were going nowhere in congress. So I said this might be a
                    good time to take this before my audience. There were about 200 women in the
                    audience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the group called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I forget the name of the group, but it was headquartered in Detroit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there were people interested in adoption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And there were women from all over the United States who were interested
                    in adopting foreign children. So I explained to them that, you, the individual
                    make the immigration law. You go to your congressman. Go to him and tell him
                    that Joe Blow from Georgia wants this restriction lifted. Vote for that bill!
                    Believe it or not, the day of my retirement party, staff aides up on the Hill,
                    came to me and said, “Frank, we just passed that bill to lift that restriction
                    on adoption of children.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We call it the Baker Bill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right. (laughs)</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Right, yes. And I got a beautiful letter from the executive director of
                    this adoption council, and that went into my personnel file, and it went a long
                    way to get me a raise before I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the mistake was that your leader picked you to speak
                        on a subject you weren't qualified...and it got the law changed. We should
                        ask you to do more things you're not qualified to do!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Not qualified to do, yes, right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other things you want to share with our readers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Only to say, if you ever go into the foreign service and end up doing
                    consular work such as issuing visas and passports, remember, for many people in
                    foreign countries, their coming to the American consul is the first contact with
                    the UA polite and courteous reception by the consul, and fair and reasonable
                    treatment for all applicants, requesting information, will serve to create an
                    atmosphere of good will and go a long way in promoting our foreign relations.
                    Also, I think it will go a long way in your career. In administering our
                    immigration laws, use everyday ordinary common sense. And, above all, be
                    responsive. This will give you a long and productive and prosperous career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:May everyone hear that, may everyone hear that Frank, but
                        I'm afraid they all don't! But thank you for telling them once more how
                        vital it is, and thanks very much for giving your time to us.</hi>
