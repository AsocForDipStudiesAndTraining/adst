                <p>Interviewed by: Roger Schrader and Herbert E. Weiner </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 18, 1991</p>

                <p>SCHRADER: Interview of Herbert Weiner. We have already collected a considerable
                    amount of background information. I would like to ask Herb now to give some of
                    his recollections about the role of the Labor Attach� function in the embassies
                    that he served in, how that fit with other members of the section, the
                    substantive sections, and other sections of the embassy. You can identify it by
                    embassy if you wish.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WEINER: Well, on my very first assignment in London, we were in no particular
                    section. I was assigned there temporarily on a probationary basis as a
                    probationary Foreign Service Officer, supposedly on a six month stint. The Labor
                    Attach� had a peculiar position in the Embassy or rather a unique position in
                    the Embassy. He was constantly pushed from one place to another, but he had a
                    very strong relationship with the Ambassador because of his network of political
                    connections; that is, connections with the Labor Government (the Attlee Labour
                    Government), the Labour Party's national organization, and with the trade unions
                    which were very, very closely associated with the government (the British Trades
                    Union Congress). That was Sam Berger and he had already in his own time
                    established himself as having unique influence. He was able to maintain his
                    standing because he was the only one with real insights into the Labor Party,
                    the Trades Union Congress and the Labor Government. The election of the Labor
                    Government in 1945 had been a surprise. Sam had been the only one in the Embassy
                    who had predicted it. The characteristic of embassies in that period or until
                    that period had been to deal mainly with a handful of people in power, namely
                    the government. In Britain most of the time they had been Tories, i.e.
                    Conservative Governments. Consequently Sam had a position of unique influence,
                    also having been very close to W. Averell Harriman who had been chief of the
                    economic assistance mission to London during World War II, and subsequently with
                    Ambassador Lewis Douglas. Since Sam was outside the orthodox structure that you
                    found in Embassies he was frequently pushed from one office to another and
                    constantly had to rely on his top level associations (with the Ambassador and
                    others) to maintain his unique position. To a degree that filtered down to me as
                    an assistant, but we were largely let alone because a lot of people in the
                    embassy in the Political and in the Economic Sections were not sure what we were
                    doing or why we were doing it or, for that matter, how to deal with these new
                    post-war problems that were arising. These were major issues of incomes policy,
                    of the relationship of the trade unions to the Labor Government, of the
                    attitudes of the trade unions towards our efforts to get the Marshall Plan
                    underway in Britain. All this was new and largely untouched by what had been the
                    usual orthodox government-to-government diplomatic relationships. It was new
                    territory. Also, the Cold War was young. Other people in the Embassy did not
                    know much about Socialists or Communists and really did not know where to start.
                    They were accustomed to dealing with orthodox political parties, the
                    establishment political parties in Britain being the Liberals and Conservatives;
                    but there wasn't anybody in the Embassy who knew very much about the Labor Party
                    or its ideological outlook.</p>
                <p>SCHRADER: O.K., Herb, now that you have given us some indication of what was the
                    role and the function in your earliest experience, how would you compare or
                    contrast that with your assignments in later years as the labor function became
                    a more established part of regular Foreign Service operations?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WEINER: Subsequently as the labor function became more established and better
                    known, it started to run into some bureaucratic problems. In a subsequent
                    assignment in Sydney for example we had no real place for the Labor Attach� in
                    either the Political or the Economic Section. So I still functioned largely on
                    my own, and functioned relatively freely. But as the issues became better known
                    other sections started to get involved. The Commercial Section would start to
                    get involved; the Political Officer would start to get involved in issues; there
                    was this overlapping, and sometimes there was friction over who did what; so the
                    Labor Attach� had to establish a sort of unique relationship with the head of
                    the particular mission if you will. In my case in Sydney it was with the Consul
                    General. In subsequent years over a period of time the Labor Attach� became more
                    and more oriented towards the political section. Sometimes for bureaucratic
                    reasons and other times largely because the issues that were dominant in his
                    field were political, he began to be moved into the Political Section. Some
                    Labor Attach�s saw this as an advantage because this gave them, they thought,
                    more clout because the Political Sections were usually the more powerful
                    sections in the Embassy. At the same time in subsequent years I found this
                    restricting. For example in New Delhi I found that what happened was that as
                    political officers tried to limit the Labor Attach� into specific
                    labor-political issues the Labor Attach�'s function was beginning to get a
                    little bit squeezed. Labor-political issues were not clearly all party
                    political, the more familiar framework to some political counselors. Labor
                    issues frequently crossed all lines - economic, political, as well as technical
                    lines. And so in many situations the labor function really did not fit, or
                    fitted very uneasily, into an orthodox embassy Political Section. In my case in
                    New Delhi the Ambassador really decided the scope and the implications of what
                    the Labor Attach� did - in New Delhi called Labor Counselor - was just too broad
                    for any one section. So the Labor Attach� was moved from the Political Section
                    into the Ambassador's Section and was directly responsible to the DCM (Minister)
                    and to the Ambassador with his own representational budget and his own
                    bureaucratic responsibilities; and his own authority to act on somewhat the same
                    level as the Political and Economic Counselor; but that was not generally the
                    case in embassies.</p>
                <p>SCHRADER: Now, Herb, you have talked about relations with other elements of the
                    Foreign Service establishment in the embassy. Do you have anything to say about
                    your own experience with other U.S. Government agencies that were a part of the
                    U.S. mission operation in the countries in which you served?</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WEINER: Well, in addition to the embassy there were the other agencies which had
                    a labor interest. There was AID (Agency for International Development); there
                    was the USIS (United States Information Service); and there was the CIA Central
                    Intelligence Agency); and there were also often other agencies beyond these when
                    you got into places like India where we had vast assistance programs in the
                    health field, and we got involved with HEW people, where you would get involved
                    with some Treasury people who were concerned with monetary policy and so forth.
                    In the technical assistance field, particularly as a I recall it in India, we
                    had very large labor programs. As a result the Labor Attach� or Labor Counselor,
                    as he was known there, in a sense became an advisor to these and other AID
                    programs, generally at the embassy policy level. These would be training
                    programs such as sending people to the United States for training in technical
                    skills, or bringing labor practitioners to India to run all sorts of training
                    programs, say in labor education, labor-management cooperation, disputes
                    settlement, productivity improvement, etc. The Labor Attach� was even involved
                    as an advisor obtaining union-management cooperation in the AID programs for
                    birth control and family planning. That came to be accepted because although you
                    had labor officers in AID technical programs there were often general political
                    and economic implications in AID programs. Since the Labor Counselor was in the
                    Ambassador's office he frequently had the ear of the Minister or the Ambassador
                    on the broader implications of these issues. In the case of USIS, the Labor
                    Counselor nominated people to come to the United States, particularly under the
                    international visitor program as a way of building affinity between the United
                    States and the host country; and also arranged for others traveling under other
                    auspices, e.g. the ILO, to visit and establish relationships in the U.S. This
                    would often come down to the question of selecting leading trade union figures,
                    people interested in labor affairs in academia or in the government, as well as
                    employers and managers, to visit the United States to look at American labor
                    practice and get an understanding of American politics and history. In other
                    words, the Labor Counselor was engaged in a multifaceted effort of trying to
                    generally orient his host country labor community into the way the United States
                    looked at the world, the way its democracy functions, the way labor-management
                    relations were conducted, the attitudes of the United States to the host country
                    and so forth. This became very important because it was hoped that people who
                    visited the United States would, over time, become leaders in their communities
                    with personal relationships in the U.S. and thereby develop a sympathetic
                    understanding of the U.S. Yet, there was a rather delicate element the Labor
                    Attach� faced. Because of the nature of the Cold War there was a tendency in
                    other countries, particularly in less developed areas, well, even in Western
                    Europe and in Britain, to see spies all over the place. This was sort of a
                    general attitude. There was a tendency to see conspiracies, and to see the CIA
                    behind everything; in India this included among some the failure of the monsoon.
                    Together with this there was also a tendency to appear even-handed politically
                    by equating the KGB and the CIA and the U.S. and the USSR as simple political
                    competitors, rather than as protagonists of democracy vs. dictatorship.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Because the Labor Attach� was functioning in a non-governmental area and nobody
                    was quite sure what his function was, there was a tendency to think of labor
                    attach�s as spies or CIA agents. Local communist parties would feed or generate
                    these suspicions about labor attach�s as part of a Cold War tactic. In my
                    personal experience, I have never worked with the CIA; never had anything to do
                    with it. I had enough on my plate to take care of what I saw as my own work.
                    From time to time I might have known who the CIA station chief was. But I can
                    honestly say that I never had a real working relationship with one, and we used
                    to be very careful to keep to our own patches to avoid any semblance of working
                    cooperatively, working in tandem, or being a working team of any sort</p>
                <p>WEINER: This is Herbert Weiner questioning Roger Schrader who comes to the labor
                    function at a different point in time, probably about 14 years later. Roger, can
                    you tell us how you got into the labor function, how it was viewed when you got
                    into it and how you viewed it...and what sort of background did you have that
                    you thought would be particularly useful to you?</p>
                <p>SCHRADER: I entered the Foreign Service in 1957 as a regular Foreign Service
                    Officer without any particular speciality. After two assignments both of which
                    were in fields that I found not particularly to my liking or interests, one a
                    consular assignment in Frankfurt and an administrative assignment in the Bureau
                    of Near East and South Asian Affairs in the Department, I discovered the labor
                    function through a person then labor advisor in the NEA Bureau, Bruce Millen,
                    who told me about the fact that there was a newly instituted training program
                    that the Department had begun just within the last few years. I applied for
                    this. At that time they were restricting entry to FSO-6's. I was an FSO-7 at the
                    time but with the strong support of my boss then and Bruce Millen and others I
                    was accepted into the program. At that time it was a full year training course
                    and after completion of it with four other junior officers who were in the
                    program I was assigned as an economic officer to the American Consulate in
                    Duesseldorf. There no longer was a labor function at that post. There had been
                    earlier years. It had been eliminated. The fact that the headquarters of the
                    German Labor movement and four or five of the larger unions in Germany were
                    headquartered in the Duesseldorf area, it provided an opportunity with the
                    training I had to engage on the side in some labor reporting and labor contact
                    work which was encouraged by the then Labor Attach� in Bonn who looked with some
                    favor on someone in the Consulate in Duesseldorf who was interested in that and
                    who was willing to do some of the work in the area on his own. So for the time I
                    was in Duesseldorf I managed to get in some labor activity and at the time also
                    Consul General was supportive of this endeavor.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The first labor assignment I had came after Duesseldorf when I was assigned
                    directly from Duesseldorf to Wellington, New Zealand. That was the first time I
                    occupied a constituted labor position, although it was quite a new one. I was
                    only the second person in the Embassy who had ever been assigned to that
                    particular function and because it was new there were some teething problems
                    again about where it belonged in the Embassy, how much time devoted, and what
                    the function was to perform. Wellington was a small Embassy with a two person
                    Political Section, which meant one assigned there had to do a number of jobs
                    which were outside both the political and the labor field and to that extent the
                    fact that having been an administrative officer and a Consular officer in the
                    past came into good use at that particular post. The position that I occupied
                    was the second position in the Political Section which was not even designated
                    as a Labor Attach� job, and this caused some consternation in Washington.
                    Eventually with some persuasion from the Labor Advisor in the Bureau of Asian
                    and Pacific Affairs the job title was actually changed to Labor Attach� rather
                    than Second Secretary-Political Officer. The role of the Labor Attach� in the
                    Embassy was something that pretty much had to be carved out since there was only
                    the second time that such a person had been assigned there. There wasn't a clear
                    and distinct track that had already been made for any incumbent coming into the
                    job. In addition the Ambassador at the time was an ex-Army General whose
                    perception of the labor movement was pretty limited, although he had superficial
                    interest in what it was all about since it was in a function assigned to his
                    Embassy; but basically there wasn't a great deal of support, and I found myself
                    being pulled frequently into other activities that were more traditional
                    political kind of reporting assignments. But about half way through the
                    Wellington tour the Ambassadors changed and the General was replaced by a former
                    Under Secretary of Labor, an AFL-CIO official in California, John Henning who
                    then brought a whole new perception to the function of labor in that Embassy.
                    From then on there really was no question as to what role the labor officer or
                    labor attach� was going to perform. During this time of course the Vietnam War
                    was in progress and lines were drawn very sharply on political issues with the
                    hard left and the Communists many of whom were in the labor movement. The
                    industrial labor movement, and many on the fringes of the Labor Party in New
                    Zealand were causing considerable problems for American policy and the Embassy's
                    attempt to implement it. So that in this environment the labor function took on
                    a fairly high profile because most or a large number of the contacts I had were
                    the people who were anti-U.S. policies in New Zealand, so that in that kind of
                    situation the role of the Labor Attach� was more easily recognized than perhaps
                    it had been at the earlier period when I had first arrived there.</p>
                <p>WEINER: Roger, let me ask you this. New Zealand seems to be a far away place, at
                    least to most Americans, and yet you were carrying on a very high-profile role
                    there. Could you tell us a little bit about the U.S.-New Zealand relationship at
                    the time or if there were relationships and activities by the AFL-CIO, which had
                    a very strong interest in what was going on in the Cold War, and also why the
                    United States would have been particularly interested in New Zealand?</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SCHRADER: Well there were a number of reasons, Herb, that New Zealand took on
                    some importance despite its small size and remoteness. There were two main
                    reasons. One, New Zealand under persuasion from the United States Government
                    committed combat troops to Vietnam, a company of infantry and two batteries of
                    artillery along with support units and so forth. It was in our interest to keep
                    this going in Vietnam despite pressures in New Zealand from the left to cancel
                    this out and to bring those forces home. Secondly, New Zealand was used
                    frequently and on a regular basis by the U.S. Navy to provide R and R for
                    sailors on ships that were on duty in Yankee Station in the South China Sea, and
                    they came in and out of ports in New Zealand on a regular basis, often with
                    protests from leftists in both the trade union movement and in the Communist
                    Party, and in the hard left (i.e. ideological) wing of the Labor Party. So those
                    were two things that we were interested in for American foreign policy reasons,
                    that is to keep New Zealand active on the side of the United States and other
                    allies in Vietnam and to thwart attempts by the hard left and the Communists to
                    cancel this particular relationship. Within this context the labor role took on
                    a highly recognizable function in the Embassy and in the New Zealand political
                    community. Shortly after my arrival on a first trip to Auckland to meet trade
                    union and political leaders in that area, I was identified immediately in an
                    issue of “The People's Voice”, which was the national Communist newspaper, as a
                    CIA spy and so forth, which was my first encounter, but not the last, with this
                    particular aspect of serving as a labor officer in the Foreign Service. The
                    AFL-CIO didn't have many contacts at all with the New Zealand labor movement at
                    the time I went out there. The relationships between the New Zealand Federation
                    of Labor, which was their main national federation, and the AFL-CIO were at a
                    pretty low watermark. The FOL in those days was heavily infiltrated at all
                    levels by hard left and Communist trade union officials, which cooled the
                    relations with 16th street. There was an attempt in each year I was there to get
                    some American trade union official to speak at the annual conference of the
                    Federation of Labor which was only partially successful. On one occasion an
                    official from Okinawa who was associated with the AFL-CIO institute in the Asian
                    area was invited to come and speak to the FOL conference but this was the only
                    time that any American trade unionist was included in the official activities.
                    The existence of John Henning down there, however, did create an embarrassment
                    for the Federation of Labor and its leadership because he was so completely
                    popular in the country at all levels and with all segments and institutions in
                    the country. It was quite apparent that the FOL was not providing him with the
                    sort of recognition and honors that other institutions were, and so a number of
                    officials of the Federation of Labor made an effort on their own and outside the
                    existing hierarchy of the organization to publicly make known their regard for
                    John Henning and to shower him with kudos and awards of their own in their own
                    unions and so forth. During this time there was an effort, at least the
                    beginning of an effort, by the AFL-CIO to include New Zealand in the larger
                    context of some sort of Asian-Pacific operation; and a delegation from the
                    AFL-CIO did appear in New Zealand at John Henning's invitation and spent
                    considerable time there with Henning and with friends in New Zealand and labor
                    officials who were counted as friends of United States - and they made quite an
                    impact during their stay in the country. This was the only official delegation
                    from the AFL-CIO that ever appeared in the country during the four years that I
                    was in New Zealand. This delegation that came to New Zealand in about 1968 and
                    included a couple of union presidents and staff members from the AFL-CIO was the
                    forerunner of what later became the institute of the AFL-CIO in the
                    Asian-Pacific area AAFLI. These people were on a kind of a ground-breaking trip
                    to look into the possibilities of the AFL-CIO establishing some kind of an
                    organization out there and New Zealand was one of a number of places they
                    visited at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WEINER: Well, Roger, in your experiences, as a matter of fact in both of our
                    experiences, we have had to deal with other agencies, could you tell us a bit
                    about what your relationships were with other agencies since others became
                    involved in labor programs?</p>
                <p>SCHRADER: I think that without question the other agency that I had most dealings
                    with was the U.S. Information Service. The posts that I served in didn't have
                    any AID components. They were all in developed countries. So USIS was the main
                    other agency that I had dealings with and I must say very favorable dealings. I
                    found that they were a very, very useful and helpful organization to deal with
                    in carrying out the manifold responsibilities in the labor function. For example
                    in Wellington the Public Affairs Officer and the U.S. Information Service
                    establishment were very helpful in organizing or implementing the International
                    Visitor Program to include labor participants. In addition they were open to
                    suggestions about how we might utilize American labor specialists coming to New
                    Zealand to better influence and assist some of the peripheral areas that
                    segments of labor movement were interested in, for example, trade union
                    education, which had a long history in New Zealand but at the time I was there
                    had become pretty dormant and to the extent that it existed at all was laced
                    very heavily with left ideological leanings. With the assistance of USIS and the
                    encouragement from a new labor institute at Victoria University in Wellington we
                    were able to get a U.S. labor expert out to spend six or eight weeks in New
                    Zealand to help formulate an effective trade union education policy. This was a
                    kind of relationship that I found very useful in later posts with USIS and I
                    always found that they were very amenable to new ideas and suggestions as how to
                    best enhance the role of the labor officer and assist him in carrying out his
                    responsibilities. In Bonn, for example, I was able to initiate a labor trade
                    union information bulletin which was issued on a regular basis and could only
                    have been done with the assistance of, again, the Public Affairs Officer and the
                    U.S. Information establishment there, because I had to depend on them for the
                    printing and distribution of this particular bulletin, and again on moving to
                    London we were able to take that idea and get it accepted by the U.S.
                    Information Service in London and they were very helpful in editing, in printing
                    and in distributing again a news bulletin that we put out on a regular basis. In
                    addition I was able to convince the Public Affairs Officer to integrate into his
                    annual budget and program a NATO trip designed exclusively for labor trade union
                    officials and in some cases Labor Party officials who were closely identified
                    with trade unions. This was a particular venture which they agreed to institute
                    and after its first success continued to incorporate it in the annual USIS
                    budget in all the years that I was in London.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WEINER: Roger, one of the things I noticed was that when I was in Australia one
                    of the issues that had evolved as a result of World War II was the change in
                    attitude in Australia towards Asians and Asian countries, which had taken an
                    extreme form in Australia called the “white Australia policy”, where Asians were
                    totally excluded from Australia. Australians tended to see themselves as
                    Europeans simply living in the Pacific area and Australia really being a part of
                    Europe. Even in the Department of State Australia was placed bureaucratically
                    within the European area rather than with Asia. Over time, however, as a result
                    of World War II Australia began to see that it had to get along better with
                    Asian countries in the Pacific area and to come to some sort of a modus vivendi
                    rather than trying to shut itself off from the Asian countries. By that I mean
                    not only Japan whom it feared but also Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the
                    Philippines and so forth. By the time I left Australia, which was in 1953, that
                    issue was just in its embryonic state of change. Had you noticed a similar kind
                    of issue happening in New Zealand and at a later date when your tour in New
                    Zealand took place? What evolution had it undergone?</p>
                <p>SCHRADER: There certainly was recognition of this phenomenon during the time I
                    was in New Zealand. I think in honesty, however, it was playing at a later time
                    cycle than it had occurred in Australia. In the mid-60's which was my time in
                    New Zealand from 1965 to 1969, the country still largely considered itself both
                    psychologically and emotionally to be an integral part of the British Isles. In
                    fact even at that late date the population breakdown of New Zealand was
                    virtually identical in numbers of Scots, Welsh, Irish and British as existed in
                    the U.K. itself and most of the people continued to consider themselves British
                    subjects. The constant refrain that one heard all the time of “going home” meant
                    going home to Britain even voiced by New Zealanders who may have been of the
                    third or fourth generation out there. This issue was brought to a head, I think,
                    in large part because of Britain's entry into the Common Market and the
                    establishment of a transition period for in effect the cutting out of New
                    Zealand's free entry into Britain of virtually all its basic products. At the
                    time I left, this was just beginning to take hold and New Zealanders were
                    fearful that this would cause some considerable disruptions in their economic
                    and social life out there. As a result they somewhat quickly began to look at
                    Asia as an area which they needed to find accommodation with what they had not
                    felt was not necessary in the past. It reached the point, for example, that a
                    large promotion campaign was undertaken by the New Zealand Government to teach
                    the Japanese to eat lamb, a product which New Zealand had in plentiful
                    quantities but for which the Japanese market had never been a significant part
                    of New Zealand's exports. This kind of interest in Asia came quite a bit later
                    than it did in Australia; but it had all of the same kinds of consequences and
                    the same motivations for it, namely that the New Zealanders saw that their
                    economic future was going to have to lie elsewhere other than with the U.K.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Another aspect of this turning away from Britain and looking to Asia also had a
                    certain amount of play out with regard for the United States. Ever since the
                    Second World War there had been an ambivalent feeling among New Zealanders about
                    where they owed their destiny. Historically, it had been Britain but at the time
                    of the Second World War with the entire New Zealand Army away from home fighting
                    with the British in North Africa they were totally defenseless against
                    encroachments of the Japanese until American Marines were sent to take up the
                    defense of New Zealand and remained for the rest of the war. This changed the
                    attitude of many New Zealanders about where their future allegiance should lie.
                    As Britain approached membership into the Common Market this looking towards the
                    United States that had emanated from the Second World War became even greater in
                    many respects because a number of New Zealanders felt that they were being
                    betrayed by Britain. I suspect that some of these same kinds of sentiments must
                    have existed also in Australia, didn't they Herb?</p>
                <p>WEINER: Well, there was this fear in Australia after the war, specifically fear
                    of the Japanese, and Australians had become very conscious that the British navy
                    was no longer a power sufficient to protect them from incursions from Asia. Also
                    there was a development of a feeling among Australians of seeing themselves as
                    sort of a United States in the Pacific. What was interesting about it is that
                    the core of the support for this was from, you might say, the historic Irish
                    immigration into Australia which had carried with it a certain anti-British
                    feeling. Australia after all is about the size of the United States and there
                    was a certain admiration for the United States and a feeling of dependence. The
                    Battle of the Coral Sea is still celebrated in Australia. Also Australia was
                    looking for investment from the United States and there had become over a period
                    of time a significant amount of immigration of Americans to Australia. At the
                    same time there remained a very strong element in Australia which persisted, as
                    in New Zealand as you mentioned earlier, in seeing any overt actions of
                    friendship or particular warmth towards the United States as a sort of act of
                    disloyalty towards the Commonwealth; and very important political figures would
                    continue, even if they had never been to Britain in their lives, to refer to
                    Britain as “going home” whenever they traveled abroad. This used to confuse
                    American Congressmen and Senators who would ask “Did you come from Britain?”
                    “Oh, no, but we are going home to Britain.”</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SCHRADER: This is Roger Schrader continuing. I would just like to mention, Herb,
                    one particular experience that I had in my career as a labor officer and that
                    was at the Embassy in Bonn from 1977 to 1980. It was my experience during that
                    time as Labor Attach� and subsequently as Labor Counselor that the interest of
                    the Embassy from the Ambassador on down was at best a kind of peripheral
                    recognition that it was something that was there and someone ought to pay some
                    kind of attention to it. My earliest recollection of arriving at the Embassy in
                    Bonn and my first meeting with the Political Counselor was his telling me, “I
                    really don't care what you do in the labor field. Just make sure that George
                    Meany never calls up the Ambassador and complains about something. Other than
                    that you can do whatever you want and whatever you think you should be doing.”
                    This to me was kind of an unusual beginning, but I think in retrospect it summed
                    up the fact that substantively the Embassy's focus was on other issues in which
                    they saw labor playing at best a marginal role. For example the two biggest
                    issues that the Embassy considered significant in terms of American foreign
                    policy interests were: number one, the installation of Pershing Two rockets into
                    the front line states and, two, offset agreements with the Government of the
                    Federal Republic on charges for troop costs of the American army there. And
                    beyond these two major issues everything else was pretty marginal and
                    subsidiary. It did not mean that there was not a recognition that these issues
                    were intertwined also with the attitudes of the opposition party, the Social
                    Democrats, at that time, but there was little recognition that this had a play
                    to any great degree in the trade unions. This was in contrast incidentally to
                    the experience that I had in Britain (and I am sure Herb has some comments along
                    this line too), that moving there in 1980 - there the issue of cruise missiles
                    and Pershing Two's was becoming an even greater issue than it had been in Bonn
                    in earlier years. The attitude of the trade unions was considered very important
                    to the Embassy in London, I suppose in large part because the trade unions were
                    such an integral part of the Labor Party as opposed to the situation in the
                    Federal Republic where although the majority of trade unions officials were
                    staunch supporters of the Social Democratic Party there was no constitutional
                    tie in between the two groups. On the contrary the German constitution stated
                    that the trade unions were a neutral force as far as partisan politics were
                    concerned. But in Britain it was quite different, and it was quite openly
                    understood that important trade unions were partisans of the Labor Party, and in
                    this particular issue with regard to the placement of cruise missiles and
                    Pershing Two's on the continent labor political opposition was very strong, and
                    many trade unions were taking leading roles in opposition to this policy which
                    the Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher was strongly supporting. So in
                    this context the element of trade unions was an issue of major importance; and
                    for the Embassy, it was recognized as being quite important.</p>

                <p>WEINER: Roger, there were a couple of incidents which were extremely important, I
                    think crucial, in which I was involved. One was our relationship with India
                    while I was Labor Counselor in India in the early 70's. This was when the Nixon
                    Administration implemented the U.S. opening to the People's Republic of China
                    and the period when the Indians, and Mrs. Gandhi in particular, who took it very
                    personally, resented the American “tilt” toward Pakistan. Traditionally and
                    historically the Indian role and the impact on its non-alignment policy had been
                    related to its relationships to China and the Soviet Union. India saw itself as
                    getting on with the Soviet Union as a counterpoise to its relationship with
                    China. When Secretary Kissinger had developed with President Nixon the opening
                    to China and preparations were underway for President Nixon and Kissinger to go
                    to China and when they stopped off in Pakistan, India's bete noire, in the
                    process as far as the Indians were concerned good relationships with the United
                    States were practically at an end. AID programs began getting closed down, not
                    on an American initiative, but rather by Mrs. Gandhi herself. As a matter of
                    fact we kept the AID mission almost intact for almost a year after the Indo-Pak
                    War of 1971. The Indian Government sharply began to cut back acceptance of U.S.
                    aid or cooperative working relationships with U.S. officials. The interesting
                    thing about this was that at that time the AFL-CIO took a position, which while
                    not absolving Mrs. Gandhi for what her attitudes were toward the United States
                    and the Soviet Union, was one that the Indians and Mrs. Gandhi saw as being
                    somewhat understanding of India's bitter reaction to U.S.-Pakistan cooperation
                    in the “opening to China”. In the end as a result of this the only really
                    effective link between the United States and India was at the trade union level
                    For example grants for other than trade unionists were not accepted by the
                    Indian Government. The Indian authorities made it difficult for these people to
                    get the exit permits to leave the country, but Indian officials used to say
                    that, well, at least the American trade unionists understand them. So the labor
                    link became one of the more essential links, and the only channel for expressing
                    American views on issues in India. This was essentially done through the Indian
                    National Trade Union Congress and the AFL-CIO.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Subsequently during my tour in London, which preceded Roger Schrader's, a
                    different issue came up which persisted for a long time. As Roger has pointed
                    out there was considerable left wing agitation in the British labor movement
                    over cruise missiles and particularly nuclear testing and the CND (the Committee
                    for Nuclear Disarmament) was quite active and quite vocal. This went hand in
                    hand with a general decline in the influence of the Labour Party at the time.
                    The Labour Party lost an election very badly in November 1979 after a long
                    period in power, and there was a general feeling in the electorate that ran
                    against the trade unions for a whole host of reasons. Mainly this popular
                    feeling crystallized around the issue that trade union power had become
                    excessive, and Mrs. Thatcher developed it effectively as a political issue in
                    her election campaign. This raised a much larger issue that persisted for almost
                    a dozen years afterwards, which actually involved the leadership of Neil Kinnock
                    as leader of the Labor Party, who had been a unilateral nuclear disarmer.
                    Feelings began to develop in the U.S., particularly those with a policy interest
                    in the subject, that possibly the special relationship between Britain and the
                    United States would be weakened significantly if a Labor Government were
                    elected. This was a new development that had never existed before in my
                    experience since World War II. Britain and the United States had been seen in
                    both countries as the closest allies; and, now in the 1980's for the first time,
                    one could say that there were feelings of serious concern in the United States,
                    even among people even who were considered visceral friends of British labor,
                    and had had long held feelings toward the British labor movement, over what
                    would happen to the relationship with the United States under a Labour
                    Government. This has been to a large extent since alleviated with the movement
                    of the Labour Party and the trade union movement closer to the political center.
                    But throughout this period from my arrival in August 1977 until I left on
                    October 26, 1980, the general focus of the Labor Attach� was the question of
                    where Britain would stand if there were a Labour Government and where it would
                    stand on the issue of unilateral nuclear disarmament.</p>
                <p>Although the AFL-CIO (and its predecessor AFL) and the British Trade Union
                    Congress have had formal fraternal relations since 1895, there were serious
                    strains between the two since World War II over East-West relations and labor
                    contact. The AFL-CIO eschewed any dealings with Communist controlled labor
                    fronts, while British unions leaned toward “contact” for a variety of reasons.
                    However, by 1979 after some delicate minuets on both sides the TUC sent a high
                    level economic delegation to the AFL-CIO breaking the ice. The idea was to
                    discuss important economic issues which faced both of them and resume a useful
                    dialogue between the world's two largest free trade union centers, while
                    avoiding the strains generated by the politics of how to deal with the “Cold
                    War” in the international labor arena.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SCHRADER: The development of this particular issue had a spin-off in terms of the
                    relationship between the British trade union movement and the AFL-CIO in the
                    United States. During this period many of the leaders and significant elements
                    in the British trade union movement were adamantly opposed not only to the
                    foreign policy and defense policy of the Thatcher Government, but of the United
                    States and of the NATO countries. The AFL-CIO was seen by many of these elements
                    as a strong and staunch supporter of these issues and that perception was which
                    was real caused a considerable freeze in the relationships between the two
                    organizations. During the time that I was there in the early years this began to
                    thaw with the exchange of delegations which was instituted by the AFL-CIO and
                    the TUC at the level of the respective economic committees of the two
                    organizations. This was done principally because both sides, that was elements
                    of both sides who wanted to continue the relationship and rebuild it realized
                    that there were so many frictions on the political issues that there really
                    would be no incentive for discussions to take place at that level simply because
                    there would be so much disagreement on the basic issues. The wiser heads on both
                    sides decided that the better choice would be to get together on economic issues
                    and to discuss these. This was continued during the first year that I was in
                    London with some success. The existence of an American trade union fraternal
                    delegate at the annual TUC Conference persisted during this whole period. It was
                    not shut off at least during my time there. However, there were some pretty
                    uneasy situations where the AFL-CIO representative was confronted with either
                    large blocks of delegates walking out of the conference hall or lack of applause
                    and in some case boos about things that this person would say, so the
                    relationship was a very uneasy one during these years caused in large part by
                    the hard left's view or antagonism towards the views of the AFL-CIO on foreign
                    policy and defense issues, with which both the United States Government and the
                    British Government under Thatcher were in pretty solid agreement.</p>
                <p>WEINER: This concludes the recollections of Roger Schrader and Herbert Weiner on
                    the origins of the Labor Attach� Program, the significance it played in our
                    diplomatic activities at posts where we were assigned and some of the major
                    issues with which we were confronted of greater or lesser significance. We may
                    add to this in the future but at this point we have run out of talk.</p>
                <p>WEINER: Today is June 18, 1991. This is the second of two tapes done by Roger
                    Schrader and Herbert Weiner. The first tape, which was transcribed, was done in
                    1987 and was given to Mr. Charles Stuart Kennedy as part of the Foreign Affairs
                    Oral History Program.</p>
                <p>Addendum by Herbert Weiner</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WEINER: This is Herbert Weiner, May 18, 1992. The following is an account of a
                    conversation I had today with Daniel L. Horowitz, who is considered the first
                    labor attach� in the Foreign Service, although in a sense because of
                    bureaucratic technicalities John Fishburn at about the same time took on the
                    functions of a labor attach� although he was not specifically designated as one.
                    Dan Horowitz explained as remembered it the source of the introduction of the
                    labor attach� program. As he recounted it, the idea was born of Isador Lubin,
                    who was a White House advisor on labor affairs to President Roosevelt, and Mrs.
                    Eleanor Roosevelt. Both of them saw the point, saw the importance of knowing
                    more about the pressures on foreign policy of working people. As he explained
                    it, it was clear that after World War Two it would no longer be the case where
                    the feelings and attitudes of the mass of the working population would not be
                    significant in the national attitudes of the various governments. Consequently
                    they spawned the idea with the State Department that as a matter of foreign
                    policy interest the United States ought to know more about what the working
                    people in the various countries with whom it has diplomatic relations are
                    thinking and what they are likely to do with respect to how their actions would
                    affect foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>Isador Lubin, who had been at Harvard, recruited Otis D. Mulliken, a young Ph.D.
                    from Harvard, who had been working at the Department of Agriculture, to come
                    into the State Department in order to start looking into the prospect for
                    establishing a corps of officers who would be assigned to various posts and who
                    would report on what was going on supposedly among the working people of
                    particular countries. It wasn't clear what these officers were supposed to do or
                    what policies they would be promoting. In effect their first function would be
                    rather to find out how significant was the influence of these working people and
                    whether this whole project as really feasible as an exercise in diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Dan Horowitz was recruited by Otis Mulliken and after some consideration as to
                    whether he should go to Mexico or Chile, it was decided that Dan would go to
                    Chile. In the recruitment process Otis Mulliken had worked up a questionnaire
                    which was then circularized some months afterwards to various embassies as well
                    as outside to see what sort of people were available for recruitment. John
                    Fishburn, according to Dan, was an economic officer, I believe in Buenos Aires,
                    and asked for permission to write to Mulliken to ask about doing this kind of
                    work and subsequently began to report on labor affairs although he was not
                    specifically designated a labor attach�. Over time beginning in 1943 when Dan
                    went to Chile, Mulliken recruited approximately 20 people, all from outside,
                    none from the Foreign Service. The reason for that was that it was believed that
                    there were not likely to find people in the Foreign Service at that time who
                    would likely be qualified or interested. It was in connection with this that Dan
                    told be that I was the first Foreign Service Officer, that is career officer, to
                    be recruited into the labor attach� system which was in October or November of
                    my first assignment of 1947, my having entered the service after taking the
                    careers officers' examination and being appointed in September 1947. I was
                    assigned to London in December of 1947 to become the Assistant to the then Labor
                    Attach� in London Sam Burger.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>According to Dan, in these early stages the Department of Labor was not
                    particularly interested or greatly involved and this was almost entirely a State
                    Department operation and even there it was largely because of the highly active
                    and imaginative role that Mulliken played that the project actually got under
                    way, although some officials in the Labor Department thought it might be
                    interesting to get some labor data from foreign countries.</p>
