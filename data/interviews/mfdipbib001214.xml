                <p>SECRETARY CYRUS R. VANCE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Paige E. Mulhollan, LBJ Library</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 3, 1969</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's begin by identifying you, sir. You're Cyrus R..
                        Vance, and your official positions in the Kennedy and Johnson
                        Administrations were entirely in the Department of Defense, as Counsel and
                        as Secretary of the Army and as Deputy Secretary [of Defense]. Then after a
                        time out of the government, you came back as Deputy Chief Negotiator in the
                        Paris peace negotiations in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Your first contact with Mr. Johnson, I suppose, comes in the 1950's while he is
                    still in the Senate. You were Special Counsel for the Committee on Aeronautics
                    and Space?</p>
                <p>VANCE: No, my first connection with President Johnson was at the time of the
                    first Sputnik. Shortly after the first Sputnik went up Senator Johnson called my
                    partner Ed Weisl and asked him if he would be willing to come down to Washington
                    to discuss with Senator Johnson and Senator Russell the possibility of acting as
                    Special Counsel for an investigation which they were contemplating holding with
                    respect to the Defense Department and the impact of the launching of Sputnik on
                    our national security. Shortly after receiving that phone call one early
                    morning, Ed Weisl asked me if I would join him and go down to Washington that
                    morning to meet at noon with Senator Russell and Senator Johnson. I had been
                    doing trial work for my partner, Ed Weisl, and inasmuch as this was going to be
                    a hearing Ed thought it might be helpful if I should come along.</p>
                <p>We did go down to Washington that morning and met at noontime with Senator
                    Russell. I cannot recall whether Senator Johnson was present at that meeting,
                    but I do recall that we had an extensive conversation with him later that day.
                    They told us at the time that they contemplated having a hearing which would
                    last two or three weeks and asked if Mr. Weisl could act as Special Counsel. He
                    said that if he did so, he would like me to come along with him and that we
                    would have to consider it further and discuss it with our partners to find out
                    whether they would have any objections to our taking off the time to do this
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>We discussed the general ground rules with Senator Johnson and received his
                    assurance that he would give us full latitude in the preparation of the hearings
                    and in the conducting of the hearings. He, of course, as chairman of the
                    committee would have the final word, but he contemplated leaving the entire
                    preparation of the hearings and the running of the hearings by-and-large to Mr.
                    Weisl and myself if we should take on the task.</p>
                <p>Under those circumstances we concluded on the way back from Washington that if
                    our partners agreed we would be willing to take on the job because we thought
                    that a useful service could be rendered for the country by having meaningful and
                    probing hearings. We were somewhat concerned however because of our lack of
                    knowledge in the area, but we believed that as trial lawyers we probably would
                    be able, with a good staff, to prepare ourselves adequately to handle the
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody knew anything about that area at that time,
                        really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Another thing that impressed us very much in our conversation with Senator
                    Johnson and Senator Russell was their statement to us that they intended this to
                    be a nonpartisan hearing; that this was not to be a witch hunt; that it was to
                    take a look at the strengths and weaknesses without any partisan caste to the
                    investigation. This was appealing to both of us and was one of the strong
                    factors in leading us to the conclusion that this was something that we should
                    take on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't say that he was trying to end up any certain
                        place? He wasn't trying to accomplish any certain things by the
                        hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, he did not. He said he merely wanted to find out what the facts were
                    and then to put the questions to the various witnesses who would be called and
                    to receive their opinions with respect to the direction the United States should
                    go; to find out where we had failed in the past, where the weaknesses lay, where
                    our strengths lay, and where our course should go in the future. But he had no
                    preconceptions about where we should come out in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he specifically indicate that he wanted you to go easy
                        on President Eisenhower, perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just the bipartisan charge would have taken care of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>VANCE: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you did undertake the task, did it work out that way?
                        Did he in fact let you run it as he had indicated he would?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He did indeed. He was one hundred percent good to his word on that. He
                    gave us full and complete authority and a free rein in what witnesses were to be
                    called, [and in] the manner of questioning the witnesses. In each and every case
                    we were permitted to question the witness first, and thereafter to examine each
                    witness after each of the Senators had had his period of questioning. Usually he
                    kept the period of the Senate questioning to either five or ten minutes per
                    Senator, which wasn't very pleasing to them from time to time. But he felt that
                    if we were goingto get on with the business of the hearings and to develop the
                    fullest record that it would be better to have it developed by a staff who had
                    prepared itself very fully than to have it done by some of the Senators who had
                    not had the time to prepare themselves as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the antecedent of the well-publicized strain that
                        was supposed to exist between Senator Johnson and Senator Symington?
                        Symington felt like he didn't have an opportunity to perhaps develop his
                        views as fully as he might have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: In part, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that rift fairly real to the staff that was doing the
                        preparation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: One could notice the tension between the two from time to time, but it
                    wasn't so marked that it marred the hearings in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, those hearings got very good press by-and-large, as I
                        recall. What about the impression that you had regarding Mr. Johnson and the
                        military at that time? Did he have a discernible viewpoint toward military
                        men in general? That's a subjective impression, but it might be important
                        from someone who saw it fairly closely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I really can't recall what feeling or impression he gave with respect to
                    military men, or the Defense Department, or the Services. I would really be just
                    dredging it out of thin air because I don't have any clear recollection on
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which probably indicates it wasn't so strong as to make a
                        big impression on you anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>VANCE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How close was your contact as Assistant Special Counsel
                        during the course of the hearings? Was it fairly extensive—daily, or every
                        other day, or just very briefly—?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, I probably saw him usually every day, because Mr. Weisl and I worked
                    hand-in-hand on this and every time Mr. Weisl saw him I saw him also. So the
                    contact was very frequent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Weisl, of course, is a long-time personal friend, too.
                        Did your friendship become nonofficial as well as official as Mr. Weisl's
                        was—social as well as business, in other words?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, of course much less than Mr. Weisl's, but Senator Johnson was very
                    kind to me and occasionally used to invite me to his house for a meal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any instance of importance in the course of the
                        hearings where he didn't take the advice of yourself and Mr. Weisl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I recall that we had some difference of opinion concerning General [James
                    M.] Gavin and General Gavin's testimony. As I recall it General Gavin testified
                    late one evening about 10:30 or 11:00 o'clock, and in his testimony he was
                    critical of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This led to a second hearing, which I
                    believe was a closed hearing, at which follow-on testimony was received from
                    General Gavin. The question arose as to how far General Gavin should be pushed
                    in his testimony. Everyone recognized that if he was pushed too far it might
                    mean the end of his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had not resigned at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, he had not resigned at that time, and the problem which I recall was
                    how far it was appropriate to push him without jeopardizing his future service
                    as an officer in the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Johnson wanted to get more criticism, to push further
                        in that case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then I believe did so. That was one of the headlines
                        that came out of the committee.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>VANCE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about a final report of the committee? Did you and
                        your staff people write that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mr. Johnson play any significant role in getting
                        agreement on the substance of it from the other Senators?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He did indeed. We drafted the report, and it was circulated on very short
                    notice to the members of the committee. When I say “we,” it was a number of us:
                    Solis Horwitz, George Reedy, Mr. Weisl, myself, Gerry Siegel, and others.</p>
                <p>Mr. Johnson displayed the greatest of skill in getting the report through the
                    committee at a short two-and-a-half or three-hour hearing the morning following
                    the completion of our drafting of the report. It was one of the most skillful
                    pieces of diplomatic statesmanship that I have run across. He was able to
                    satisfy the differing views of members of the committee, which in some instances
                    were quite disparate, and to get with a few minor changes unanimous approval of
                    the report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been a real serious threat that there was going
                        to be a minority report on the part of some of the Senators?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: There was talk to that effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Johnson's personal activity was, you think, important
                        in preventing it, as it turned out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed then, or came back later, to work with the
                        Preparedness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed services Committee while
                        Johnson was still Chairman?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>VANCE: No. The same committee, which was the Senate Preparedness Investigating
                    Subcommittee, that did that hearing reached a conclusion that it would hold
                    periodic hearings following the closure of the main body of the hearings over a
                    period of time for the purpose of holding the feet of the Defense Department
                    officials to the fire. So that all the subsequent hearings that took place on a
                    bimonthly or trimonthly basis throughout 1958-59 were merely a continuation of
                    the previous hearings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were more or less recessed in that case, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That's correct. The original hearings, rather than lasting for the two
                    weeks that we were told lasted as I recall about four-and-a-half or five months.
                    Thereafter we used to spend two or three days every two months in these follow
                    up hearings so that we put in a good deal of time in the hearings over a period
                    of two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your connection then with the Committee on Space
                        and Aeronautics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It was decided by the leadership in the Senate, sparked as I recall by
                    Senator Johnson, that it was necessary to create a new organization to handle
                    the developments in space which it was obvious in the post-Sputnik period would
                    be forthcoming, and that this should be a civilian organization. Therefore it
                    was determined that hearings should be held to take testimony as to what form
                    this organization should have and to draft an act which would establish this
                    organization and set out the ground rules for the future conduct of the space
                    activities of theUnited States. Senator Johnson who chaired that Special
                    Committee on Space and Astronautics, again asked Mr. Weisl and me if we would
                    act as consulting counsel for the committee during the hearings, which we agreed
                    to do. Therefore we, along with the regular staff which had been assigned to
                    work with this Special Committee, conducted the hearings which led to the
                    drafting of the Space Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mr. Johnson as involved in this as he had been in his
                        earlier task with these post- Sputnik investigations? Or was he that closely
                        interested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He was very closely interested. I don't believe he devoted quite as much
                    time to it as he did the missile and satellite hearings, as they were called,
                    but he did devote a considerable amount of attention to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't recall any major episodes that got in public
                        prints about that hearing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>VANCE: No, it was a pretty straightforward hearing. It was well conducted by
                    him—took the necessary testimony and came up with what I think has proved to be
                    a pretty sound piece of legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then were back in 1960—similar to the things you had
                        been doing—with the missile gap, as they were called, investigations.
                        Allegedly, at least, they are not quite so nonpartisan as the earlier ones
                        had been. Is that a true impression that one gathers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: A degree of partisanship did creep in. I don't think because Mr. Johnson
                    wanted it that way, but this became such a sensitive issue in a pre-election
                    period that regardless of what anybody wanted to see, it did take on a partisan
                    tinge. I know that people within the Administration felt that the allegations
                    with respect to a missile gap were tinged with partisanship.</p>
                <p>I think that most of the members of the staff felt, that on the basis of the
                    evidence which was available, there was indeed a missile gap. This was the
                    testimony which was being elicited from the witnesses so that the staff, and I
                    think a majority of the members of the committee, particularly on the Democratic
                    side, didn't feel that this was a partisan charge. But, as I say, because of the
                    sensitivity of the charges at that particular point in the pre-election period,
                    it inevitably became a partisan issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the spring of 1960, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mr. Johnson obviously an active candidate at that
                        time? Did it show up in his activities that you could see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He was talked of as a candidate. He kept saying that he didn't want to run
                    and would not run—that he had too much to do in the Senate—but still there was a
                    tremendous amount of speculation and comment in the newspapers that he would be
                    a candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And his immediate staff acted like he might be
                        running?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, they did. I think that the members of his immediate staff felt that
                    he would be a candidate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a good deal of jockeying in that episode between
                        the Johnson and the Kennedy forces for a favorable image for their
                        respective heroes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think the answer is yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just sort of going forward and looking back—Mr. Kennedy
                        when he took office would say that the missile gap was perhaps not as real
                        as had been advertised. Why would the professional work that was done by
                        this committee have in your opinion received a different impression than
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I don't think he said when he took office what you have suggested he said.
                    I think what happened in the period immediately after he took office is that Mr.
                    McNamara, in reexamining the data which had become available during that last
                    few months—four or five months—preceding the change of administration, came to
                    the conclusion that there was less of a gap than had been predicted by the
                    witnesses who had been testifying. Mr. McNamara being an honest man stated that
                    this was his conclusion. President Kennedy then accepted the conclusion which
                    his Secretary of Defense had reached.</p>
                <p>The specific answer to your question is, in my judgment, that the evaluations
                    which were made were honest evaluations, but as more evidence became available
                    the facts simply showed that the Soviets did not take a course which it was
                    believed by the CIA and others that they would take, with the result that the
                    missile gap was either nonexistent, or not as large anyway, as people had
                    predicted it would be.</p>

                <p>VANCE: Right.</p>

                <p>VANCE: Yes, I did.</p>

                <p>VANCE: Again, Mr. Weisl, as I recall it, was asked by Senator Johnson to come and
                    assist him in Los Angeles. Ed asked me if I would come along with him, and I
                    said I would be very happy to do so. That's how I got there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: We did call on some delegations. I did call on people whom I knew in the
                    West Virginia delegation, and Eddie and I called on people whom we knew in the
                    Delaware delegation. Those were the only two delegations with whom I had any
                    personal contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever asked for your advice or your opinion

                <p>VANCE: No.</p>

                <p>VANCE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once the campaign occurred and the election was
                        successfully held, it was commonly believed, at least, that those men who
                        had been associated with Mr. Johnson in one capacity or another got into the
                        new Administration at least partly because of his influence. Do you think
                        that's true in your case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think partly true. The procedure which was used by Mr. McNamara was to
                    talk with a large number of individuals out of which he called a long list of
                    names. He then cross-checked these names with other people in whose judgment he
                    had confidence. He then arrived at a list of final names whom he wished to
                    associate with him in positions of responsibility in the Department of Defense.
                    Prior to completing his check I understand that, in my case, and I know in the
                    case of John Cormally, he did check or had someone check for him, what the view
                    of senator Johnson, the Vice President-to-be, was with respect to me and about
                    me and whether or not he had any reservations about my qualifications to serve
                    in a Presidential appointee's slot. As I understand it this was the contact.</p>

                        such a connection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, the Defense Department had a military officer, and there may have
                    been two—at least one military officer was assigned to his permanent staff. I
                    believe it was Colonel [Howard L.] Burris, but I may be wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the name I have. His job was just to keep the Vice
                        President informed of what the Defense Department was doing in any given

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: And to act as liaison for routine chores from time to time that might come
                    up. In terms of, you know, seeking information with respect to substantive
                    matters, the Vice President would deal directly with the Secretary of Defense
                    and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, or other Presidential appointees.</p>

                <p>VANCE: Very seldom, when I was General Counsel.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>VANCE: I believe that President Kennedy consulted him about it, but I think the

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your implication was you did have a little closer contact

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. He really didn't have many problems with matters which put him in
                    contact with the Department of Defense as the Vice President. You see, his
                    principal responsibilities at that point were his legislative responsibilities
                    on the Hill, his general advice and consultation with the President on domestic
                    matters, and his special responsibilities in the field of space and
                    astronautics. So that the only other contact he had was as a member of the
                    National Security Council, and in that respect he would be dealing directly with
                    the Secretary of Defense and not with the Secretary of the Army.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, he appointed me Deputy Secretary of Defense, and I was appointed
                    Deputy Secretary of Defense in January of 1964.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. Again, I think that he acted on the recommendation of Bob McNamara,
                    and Bob told me that the President had approved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were just made Deputy Secretary without having a

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>VANCE: That's right. He always operated in that way. At least in our Department,
                    he believed very strongly that the man through whom you ought to deal was the
                    head of the Department. So Bob McNamara was the man in charge of the Department,
                    and he would deal through Bob. Now when I became Deputy Secretary of Defense, if
                    Bob was out and I was Acting Secretary, of course he would deal with me. Or if
                    he couldn't reach Bob on the phone because Bob was up on the Hill testifying,
                    then he would call me directly me on the phone. But he was a man who dealt
                    through the senior man in the organization.</p>

                <p>VANCE: No. Almost immediately after I became Deputy Secretary of Defense, the
                    Panama situation exploded, and the President asked Tom Mann and me to go to
                    Panama to see what we could do about cooling the situation down there. Tom and I
                    did go and spent several days during the fighting down there until it was
                    brought under control. Then we came back and made certain recommendations to the
                    State Department, the Defense Department, and to the President with respect to
                    what steps we felt should be taken to try and ameliorate the situation and to

                    were the Secretary of State, Deputy Secretary of State, the Secretary of
                    Defense, myself, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Tom Mann, who was the
                    Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs—or maybe at that point he was
                    even the Under Secretary; I think he may have been, as a matter of fact—and the
                    Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, McGeorge Bundy, his special
                    assistant. I believe that was about all who were present. The President reviewed
                    the situation, received the recommendations of his advisors, and determined that
                    under the circumstances that it was necessary to send this small group down
                    immediately to Panama, and by noon we were on the way to Panama.</p>

                    the facts as you see them. Report back what you see and your recommendations as
                    to how to get on top of the immediate crisis and to stop the killing that is
                    going on. Secondly, take a look at the long-term problems and be prepared when
                    you come back to make recommendations to me as to how you think we should move

                        sending of troops?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I don't recall attending any meetings at the White House prior to the
                    sending of troops. I do recall discussing the building tensions with Mr.
                    McNamara and with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I do recall discussing
                    the contingency plans which existed and the need to re-look at the contingency
                    plans to see whether or not the forces provided by the contingency plans were
                    sufficient in case it was necessary to move.</p>
                <p>On the day that the decision to go into the Dominican Republic was made, I was
                    not at the meeting at which the decision was made. I was back at the Department
                    of Defense. t received a call from the White House, I believe it was Mr.
                    McNamara, telling me that the decision had been made and that we should take the
                    necessary steps to get the wheels moving. Thereafter I did attend a meeting—I
                    believe it was the next morning although it may have been later that day. I
                    believe it was the next morning—at which the situation was reviewed. It was
                    determined that it would be advisable to send a team who would act as emissaries
                    of the President to the Dominican Republic. At that meeting it was decided that
                    there should be three of us—Mac Bundy, Tom Mann, and myself. As a matter of
                    fact, there were four—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tony Solomon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. [Jack] Vaughn, who was Assistant Secretary of Latin American Affairs.
                    Tony Solomon didn't come down until later on.</p>
                <p>Once the decision was made, the team was put together very rapidly, and we flew
                    immediately to Puerto Rico where we split up with Mac Bundy and I talking with
                    Juan Bosch in Puerto Rico, and Tom Mann and Vaughn going over to Santo Domingo
                    to view the situation there.</p>
                <p>Coming back again, I do recall participating in the carrying out of the
                    contingency plans after the decision was made. I remember going to the State
                    Department and sitting there with George Ball as the decisions were being
                    implemented to land troops in Santo Domingo. I remember we were in constant
                    touch with the Department of Defense. Decisions had to be made continually with
                    respect to a number of matters such as whether we should try and air-drop troops
                    in during the night, or whether we should wait and bring them in in the morning.
                    Fortunately, we decided to do the latter, after full consultation with the
                    Department of Defense, because it turned out that our maps were faulty and that
                    if our troops had jumped in there in the darkness, there would have been a
                    substantial number of casualties. We learned some lessons from that about
                    updating all the maps which were to be used in connection with contingency
                    operations.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the criticisms, before you leave that subject, of
                        the whole operation by the critics of it, was that the force used was far
                        more numerous than would have been required to do the job. Whose decision
                        would that have been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That was a decision which was reached by the President on the
                    recommendation of Mr. McNamara and myself. Both of us felt that one of the
                    lessons that history teaches is that if you are going to use military force you
                    should use sufficient force to accomplish your task; and that if you put in
                    sufficient force, you may be able to cut down the bloodshed. One of the
                    difficulties that you find is that an inadequate force almost invariably tends
                    to find itself being overrun, which leads to more fighting and more bloodshed on
                    both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And ultimately more force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That's right, so that we made the determination, or advised, that if we
                    were going to go in, we ought to put in enough troops and you ought to err on
                    the side of having put in too many rather than putting in too few. So it was on
                    our advice that a force of some twenty-odd thousand was put in rather than a
                    smaller force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had contingency plans, I suppose, that would have put
                        in smaller numbers or even larger numbers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Of course, this took place over a period of time, and the numbers were
                    changed as you went on. Originally the force that was put ashore was a
                    battalion-landing team, as I recall it, of the Marines, which was put in to
                    remove the civilians—both American and other foreign nationals—who were being
                    threatened at that point by the violence which was taking place. As the conflict
                    escalated and other factors began to emerge, the situation was looked at again
                    and it was determined then that we should put in a larger force and it was at
                    this point that that we recommended that if we were going to put in this large
                    force, that it should be sufficient. Therefore we ought to put in a force of
                    some fifteen to twenty thousand which eventually we increased to about
                    twenty-two thousand, as I recall it.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>VANCE: I think that there were some questions raised as to whether or not we
                    needed that much force. I don't recall the argument being made strongly, but I
                    think the question was raised. I can't recall who made it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a strong argument that we shouldn't have been

                <p>VANCE: Nobody raised that—</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. There was a real question raised as to whether or not we should have
                    put any troops ashore prior to a meeting of the Organization of American States,
                    but that was a different issue from the issue of whether or not it was proper to
                    put American troops ashore, at least initially to protect the withdrawal of
                    American nationals and other foreign nationals. I don't think there was any
                    dispute on the desirability of that action initially, but there was considerable
                    dispute both within and without the government on the question of acting before
                    the OAS met.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the decision made to act before it met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I wasn't present at that meeting itself, but I understand that the
                    decision was made because of the recommendation of the Ambassador and those on
                    the ground were such that—</p>

                <p>VANCE: That's right. That unless this were done immediately the result would be
                    the loss of American lives and the lives of other foreign nationals, and he
                    recommended that steps be taken immediately. On that basis the decision was
                    taken to put troops in immediately.</p>

                        of the fact that the very intervention itself might prejudice one side or
                        the other, that it might, in fact, act to prevent the success of the
                        revolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I wasn't present at that meeting, so I don't know whether that was
                    discussed at that meeting or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started into your episode of going down there. Was the
                        only instruction that you got the one that you received at the meeting where
                        it was decided for the three of you to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I can't recall what the specific instructions were. I know that the first
                    task we were assigned was to talk to Juan Bosch and to see whether or not there
                    was a basis for finding a new government which would be acceptable to a majority
                    of the Dominicans and form a basis on which the fighting could be stopped. This
                    was the thrust of our activities during the first long day and night that we
                    spent in Puerto Rico. We met for six or eight hours, as I recall it, with Juan
                    Bosch and discussed with him the situation. Mac Bundy took the lead in these
                    discussions with Bosch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Bosch saying different things to you and Mac Bundy
                        than he was saying publicly during this period? Was he really in touch with
                        the situation closely enough to know what was going on</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He was in touch. He told us, and I have no reason to doubt it [that he
                    talked] on a frequent basis, namely several times a day, with people in Santo
                    Domingo, so that I think that he had fairly current information as to what was
                    going on in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he think that he had control of the rebel situation
                        still, at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, I think that he felt that he did have control of the rebel situation.
                    He also felt that the only way of finding a solution to the problem was to put
                    in a provisional chief executive who would be someone affiliated with him and
                    with his party, namely Bosch's party, and he specifically suggested an
                    individual whose name I simply cannot remember now. The discussion really
                    centered around whether or not this man had sufficient stature to become a chief
                    executive officer, or the President—or at least the provisional President—of the
                    Dominican Republic, and whether or not he could gather around him a government
                    of national reconciliation which would provide a basis for ending the fighting
                    and some hope of stability pending new elections. One of the basic issues, of
                    course, was the issue of the Constitution, and whether or not the old
                    Constitution would obtain or whether the new Constitution would obtain. This was
                    one of the fundamental theological issues that permeated the whole period and
                    the dialogue during that period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a widely written-about rift, at least, between Mr.
                        Bundy's view that the provisional government ought to include some of the
                        rebel elements, and Mr. Mann's belief that perhaps it shouldn't. Does that
                        mean that the three-man mission worked at cross purposes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, I just think that we had different views. Mac and I believed that it
                    was essential that you have people from the Constitutionalist Bosch group in the
                    government and, perhaps, even as the provisional President. Tom simply did not
                    share that view and didn't hesitate to express his views and his reasons for
                    those views to the President and others in Washington. We discussed our
                    differences with each other, and eventually Tom went back to Washington where he
                    presented his views firsthand. Mac and I remained on in Santo Domingo. Finally
                    Mac returned, and I stayed on to the bitter end until the group—of which
                    Ellsworth Bunker was one—of the OAS came down to take over from us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, at one point, Fir. Bundy have what he thought was an
                        arrangement which Washington didn't buy because perhaps Mr. Mann
                        disagreed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: My recollection was that he thought we were pretty close to an
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>The man's name whom I was trying to think of is Guzman. Antonio Guzman. We
                    thought at one point that we had a government built around Guzman that would be
                    acceptable. We found however that, as in all these things, there are many
                    sticking points. One of the main sticking points was the question of who would
                    be the respective senior military officers under any such government. I played a
                    role in that aspect of our discussions and acted as the contact with the
                    Dominican Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Once we left Puerto Rico and came to the Dominican Republic we split our work so
                    that Mac and, for awhile, Tom dealt with the civilians and I dealt with the
                    military, trying to put together this package which would provide an acceptable
                    solution. I urged upon the Chiefs of Staff that they all tender their
                    resignations on the basis that the only way to find national reconciliation was
                    to find a new group which would be acceptable to both sides, because it was
                    quite obvious that the current Chiefs of Staff were unacceptable to the
                    Constitutionalists. At one point they had all agreed to tender their
                    resignations. However in a period of an hour-and-a-half after we had reached
                    that understanding, they all went and talked to Tony Imbert, and somehow in the
                    process of that conversation it became unstuck. So that that part of the
                    proposed package fell apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Imbert was John Barnlow Martin's man, was he not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes. He had acted earlier in the crisis as the de facto leader of the
                    so-called Loyalists, or government group. He moved into a vacuum which existed
                    and because of his strong and tough personality, and I believe with some urging
                    from the United States, took over the de facto leadership of the government. He
                    was one with whom we also had to deal because he felt quite strongly that he was
                    being dumped, which he didn't like, when the suggestion was made that he should
                    step aside for Guzman or anyone else. So that our conversations went primarily
                    along the following lines: conversations with Guzman and the Constitutionalists
                    on the one hand: with the Chiefs on another hand: and thirdly, with Imbert and
                    the people who rallied around Imbert. So it was a pretty complicated puzzle that
                    we were trying to assemble.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying that essentially the agreement that you and
                        McGeorge Bundy thought you had fell apart more from Dominican reasons than
                        from anything that Washington did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, I think that's fair.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Washington was not very happy with the agreement,
                        apparently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: As I recall it, they weren't very happy with the agreement. They had some
                    real questions as to whether this was a viable alternative and weren't really
                    too enthusiastic about it.</p>

                        that was firm? That's the implication of some of the stories that have
                        been—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, they did not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not what you thought at all. What was your
                        impression of the situation in the Dominican Republic as compared to the
                        information that the mission was giving Washington at the time you left? Did
                        it prove to be accurate, or do you think that they were perhaps
                        over-reacting in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Again, it's hard to recall precisely what we knew before and what we found
                    after, because these things tend to run together. It became very clear, however,
                    once we were there that the country was in a mood for a bloodbath; that the
                    passions were deep and inflamed; that the first thing that had to be done was to
                    try and get a cease fire, otherwise the bloodshed was going to be unbelievable.
                    It was to that end that the decision was made to interpose our troops between
                    the two contending forces along that central line running from the Ambassador
                    Hotel to the west all the way through the town, across the bridge, and out to
                    the airport on the east. I think that the decision to do that was a sound
                    decision. Without the interposition of the American and, later, other OAS
                    forces, I think that the bloodshed would have been vastly greater. Indeed,
                    [Colonel Francisco] Caamano [Deno] told me privately in one of my conversations
                    with him that if the United States had not interposed itself between the
                    contending forces that thousands and perhaps scores of thousands of Dominicans
                    would have been killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The rebels, then, were agreeing to that position too, as
                        well as the government forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He wasn't saying that he agreed to it. He was stating it as a fact that it
                    did save thousands and perhaps scores of thousands of Dominican lives. He said
                    that this was something that he would never admit publicly but that it was a
                    fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you agree that by the end of that week that there were
                        Communist elements or Cuban elements that had gained substantial control of
                        the rebel forces, or substantial influences in the rebel forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: There were Communist elements in the forces. I think there is a question
                    as to how strong these elements were. There was a good deal of straight
                    nationalist and anti-government sentiment in the group, but it's also clear that
                    there were some Communist elements. It was awfully hard to measure or weigh the
                    influence of any single group at a given point of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an agreement among the observers in the

                <p>VANCE: No.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some thought it was more than you did, apparently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Although I think it was quite clear that there were a substantial number,
                    and one of the elements of the package which was discussed was what was going to
                    be done with the ones who everybody knew were Communists. The question was how
                    should they be treated, how were you going to isolate them, should they be
                    expelled from the country, or should they be arrested and put together in a
                    particular location within the country. This was one of the big debates and one
                    of the sticking points again with Guzman. Guzman, originally, as I recall it,
                    indicated he thought that this problem could be handled, and that they could
                    expel the known Communists from the country. As time wore on however, this
                    apparently became more and more difficult for him to produce, am this was one of
                    the reasons that he eventually was unable to produce a proposal along those
                    lines that was satisfactory to the United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Washington understood that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It understood it. I think at different time it was clear that different
                    weights were placed by different individuals on the nature and extent of the
                    Communist threat, I think thinking changed in Washington over a period of time.
                    In the early stages I think there was a general feeling in Washington that there
                    was a substantial Communist presence and that they were in fact taking over, and
                    that this did have the seeds of another Cuba. But I think as time went on and
                    more information became available, people realized that this perhaps was not the
                    fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this mean that when the OAS goes in they will be able
                        to conclude agreements in the Dominican Republic that would not have been
                        acceptable to Washington earlier, because of better understanding as to what
                        the situation really is?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think some of the OAS forces were coming in while I was still there. I'm
                    quite sure they were.</p>

                    Then Mr. Bunker came in and did a superb job of guiding, with his colleagues
                    from the OAS, the country up to a point where they selected a provisional
                    President—[Hector Garcia] Godoy, and then put together a provisional government
                    which acted pending elections, which as you know resulted in the election of
                    [Joaquin] Balaguer. But Bunker did a superb job in a very trying period in
                    advising Godoy, in holding the situation together as the inevitable strains came
                    during the months that followed the taking over of power as a provisional

                        contact with that crisis during its hottest period. That's the one where
                        they count the phone calls to Bundy and things like that. Did he stay that
                        interested in it and close to making the decisions personally in the period
                        where it was finally settled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He followed it very closely, of course, not so closely as when it was at
                    its height. But he followed it very closely and was extremely careful in
                    evaluating and finally making the decisions with respect to the settlement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps we can take care of the urban missions that you
                        performed in 1967 and 1968 in that remaining time if that's satisfactory.
                        The first one, I suppose, is the Detroit one which took place in a kind of
                        compressed period of time. Perhaps you might just describe your
                        involvement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I had gone to Europe on leaving the Defense Department at the end of June,
                    and I had been abroad for about a week when my mother died and I returned to the
                    United States, and was in Clarksburg where my mother lived for several days.
                    Then I returned to Washington on Sunday night. On Monday morning I received a
                    call from Mr. McNamara who said that he was with the President in the White
                    House in the Cabinet Room, and he wanted to know—the President wanted to
                    know—whether I would be able and willing to go to Detroit immediately, if
                    necessary, in connection with the trouble which had broken out there Sunday, I
                    said that I really hadn't had any chance to inform myself as to what was going
                    on because I'd just gotten back late the night before from my mother's funeral,
                    and asked him what the general nature of it was. He told me that the rioting had
                    broken out in Detroit, and that it appeared to be an increasingly difficult and
                    dangerous situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this early in the morning now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: This was about 9:30, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the authorities had actually asked for
                        troops to be sent in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Well, I think it was questionable whether they had or hadn't asked, as I
                    recall it. This was one of the issues, whether they had or hadn't asked.</p>
                <p>I told him that I would be happy to go if I could take my wife along with me,
                    because at that point my back was acting up badly and I couldn't bend over to
                    tie my shoe laces or get my socks off. If it was all right for her to come along
                    and help me get in and out of my clothes, that I would do it. He said, of
                    course, that would be all right and for me to come down to the White House right
                    away.</p>
                <p>I did then go down to the White House and went to the Cabinet Room where a large,
                    or fairly large, group was sitting around the table. Someone, and I can't
                    remember who, summarized the situation as it stood and said that they had had a
                    specific request, finally, from Governor [George] Romney to send federal forces
                    to Detroit. They had tentatively come to the conclusion that this should be done
                    right away; that alerting orders had already been sent out during the night to
                    certain units, and that they should be able to move very promptly. It was
                    decided that a call should be placed to Mayor [Jerome P.] Cavanagh, and I can't
                    remember whether Romney was called also—but I do remember that Cavanagh was
                    called. The call was put in from the White House and at the end of the call I
                    was asked to go on the phone and tell them that I would be out there and give
                    them an approximate time, which I did.</p>
                <p>I then got on the phone and talked to General Throckmorton, who would be the
                    troop commander and was then at Fort Bragg, and told John, whom I knew, that the
                    order was being issued to load troops and fly them in, and that he should
                    execute the order. He asked me whether General Wheeler was there, as I recall
                    it. I believe that he was and I said yes; that this was an official order
                    although it was coming strangely from me, a civilian who was no longer
                    associated with the Department of Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these units previously designated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, they had been designated the night before.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean, they hadn't been designated over a long period
                        of time for such use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I don't recall. At least part of that division, which was the 82nd, had
                    been previously designated under the standing contingency plans. As to whether
                    this group had been in its full extent designated under one of the contingency
                    plans, I just don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering about training, really, in that case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: They had had some training in riot control as part of their normal
                    training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But no special training in riot control for these
                        designated units?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, but in the post-Dominican period people in the Regular Army had all
                    received intensive training, as I recall it, in the kinds of problems that one
                    faced in urban communities where fighting broke out. This was particularly true
                    of the airborne forces which would be the first ones to move in as they were in
                    the Dominican Republic. So they were fully trained for the kinds of problems
                    that one meets in a foreign urban environment, and to a certain extent the
                    problems have similarities to those which you find in an urban conflict in a
                    domestic situation.</p>
                <p>We then went over to the Washington National Airport where a plane had been put
                    aside for us, or sent over for us. I borrowed from General Wheeler a Colonel,
                    John Elder, who was a very able fellow whom I knew, and also borrowed from Bob
                    McNamara Dan Henkin, an old friend who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Public Affairs, and in whose judgment I had great confidence, and took them with
                    me as advisers and staff for the operation.</p>
                <p>We flew out direct non-stop to a military field immediately north of Detroit and
                    when I got there I found that General Throckmorton had already landed. I went in
                    and had a very brief meeting with him and got a report of what the situation
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His troops were being held there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That's right. They were landing at the time. They were beginning to come
                    in and were landing. He came with the first string that came in—the first string
                    of planes—so that he was already on the ground. His troops would not totally
                    close until some time, as I recall it, late that evening, and I arrived around
                    mid-afternoon.</p>
                <p>We called the Mayor's office and learned that he was meeting in the office with
                    the head of the Michigan National Guard, and that he wanted us to come down to
                    the office and meet with the Governor and with him to review the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>General Throckmorton changed into civilian clothes and we drove down to the
                    Mayor's office where we met with the Governor, the Mayor, and the General in
                    charge of the National Guard. We received a report on the situation which
                    indicated that it was quieter than it had been the day before; that more troops
                    had been moving into the city during the night and day as a result of
                    deployments from Camp Grayling [?] where the National Guard had been at summer
                    camp, and that there were several thousand more troops in the city than there
                    were before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are all National Guard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: National Guard, that's right. We asked the National Guard commander
                    whether these troops had been deployed out into the streets, and he indicated
                    that they had not. We suggested to him strongly that he ought to get them out
                    into the streets as rapidly as possible, that it made no sense at all to bring
                    troops into the city and not deploy them where they could act as a deterrent to
                    a resumption of violence should that occur.</p>
                <p>It was then suggested that we should take a trip through the areas where greatest
                    destruction had occurred in a car to get a firsthand look at the situation—which
                    both General Throckmorton and I felt was necessary before we made a
                    determination as to whether or not we should deploy into the city the federal
                    forces. We took this trip through the city. It lasted, I think, about an hour or
                    an hour-and-a-half. There was a considerable amount of destruction, buildings
                    still burning, broken glass on the streets. But by and large it was relatively
                    quiet. There didn't seem to be an undue amount of surliness, nor was the feeling
                    of tensions which you get in a situation like this apparent at that point.</p>
                <p>When we returned to the Mayor's office, where they had provided us with some
                    space, I found that there was a group of Negro citizens including the two
                    Congressmen, John Conyers and Charlie Diggs, who said that they wished to meet
                    with us. I said I'd welcome that, because I wanted to get the feeling from the
                    Negro community on this issue. Some, led by John Conyers, indicated that the
                    situation appeared to be quieting, that if federal troops were put in that this
                    might exacerbate the situation rather than quiet it. They recommended that the
                    troops be held in reserve at the air force base where they were now assembling
                    that was located about—my recollection is—fifteen to twenty miles outside of
                    town.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Charlie Diggs and another group said that their information
                    was that things would heat up again as night fell, and troops ought to be moved
                    in immediately.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Governor Romney came in after the meeting and asked that the federal troops be
                    moved into the city. I said that I was not yet satisfied from the information I
                    had received that there was a necessity for the federal troops to be moved in
                    because we had not yet seen what the effect would be of the deployment of
                    several thousand additional Guard troops in the city; that part of the Negro
                    community had indicated that they felt the situation was quieting and it would
                    exacerbate it to bring federal troops in; that another group had held a contrary
                    view, but that under all the circumstances I felt that the safest thing was to
                    watch and wait and if it became clear that the federal troops should come in
                    that we then would move. We discussed the desirability of, in the meantime,
                    perhaps moving some troops closer into town so that if they had to be deployed
                    that it could be done more promptly.</p>
                <p>The Governor and I then went on the radio and television and made a brief
                    statement with respect to the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Governor express disagreement with your view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Not on television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Privately before the television?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes. He said he did not agree. He felt that it would be wiser to move them
                    in right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in touch with Mr. Johnson during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I reported after the interview with the press my conclusions to, I
                    believe, it was Mr. McNamara, who was, I also believe at the White House at that
                    point. We said we would continue to follow the situation very closely.</p>
                <p>As the evening wore on, as we approached nine o'clock, I could see the incidents
                    building up. We had set up a reporting system, incidentally, as soon as we came
                    in. We wanted a report on the number of fires per hour, the number of—it was a
                    half-hour, I think it was, every half-hour—the number of sniping incidents, the
                    number of people arrested, and a whole spectrum of indicators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were federal people reporting to you or local
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: These were figures gathered by the police and were given to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Also, in the meantime we had, before I had the press conference, called and
                    checked with the local FBI people and gotten their Judgment with respect to the
                    situation. My recollection is that they said that it was unclear as to whether
                    the situation would get hotter or cooler as the night wore on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A safe prediction.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: As the evening wore on, however, the indicators showed that the curve was
                    beginning to rise again. We reported this to Washington and said that if it
                    continued to rise, we were going to come to the conclusion that we would
                    recommend that troops be deployed; that we were still not satisfied that this
                    wasn't the normal incident that occurs as nightfall sets in.</p>
                <p>We kept in constant touch with Governor Romney and the Mayor. As the incidents
                    started to rise, they became more vocal about the need for deploying federal
                    troops.</p>
                <p>I believe it was somewhere around nine-thirty or so, and all of this is in a
                    report that I prepared in the post-riot period—and I'm just doing it from memory
                    now—about nine-thirty or so we came to a tentative conclusion that we were going
                    to have to perhaps put our troops in so that we made preparations and started
                    moving them into town. It was somewhere after ten o'clock that we told the
                    President that we felt the troops must be deployed.</p>
                <p>As I recall it, they said they wanted a little bit of additional time to prepare
                    a statement which the President was going to issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The President wanted additional time, not the troops?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, the President, for a statement which he was going to issue. But in the
                    meantime to go ahead and make all the necessary preparations so they could move
                    as rapidly as possible.</p>
                <p>I've forgotten exactly, it's in my report, as to when we got the authority to
                    actually deploy into the city, but we then did move them into the city. In the
                    meantime General Throckmorton and I had a plan whereby we put the federal troops
                    on one side of the city and left the other side of the city under the
                    responsibility of the National Guard troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So from your account, the only point at which there could
                        be a charge that the President was delaying, for whatever reason, would be
                        from nine-thirty or so—ten o'clock—when you called, and the time that you
                        got authority to issue the order, however long that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>VANCE: Yes. Now, charges have been made that we should have put troops in
                    immediately once I arrived. I myself felt that this was premature because of the
                    factors that I have indicated. And I think any such charge against the President
                    is totally unfounded. I was his representative there. I was recommending to him
                    that he do nothing until we had a chance to ascertain what the facts were; that
                    the putting of federal troops into a state is not a thing that is lightly done,
                    and that circumstances were not sufficiently clear either to General
                    Throckmorton or to me that this should be done—for him to act. So certainly in
                    those early hours when we were first there there could be no basis at all for a
                    charge that he was unduly delaying deployment of the troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earlier before you left, I believe you mentioned in
                        passing that there was some genuine confusion in Washington about whether
                        troops had been asked for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That's right. Requests were apparently made and then withdrawn. There was
                    a very confused situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there obvious instances of difficulty between the
                        federal forces and the National Guard during that period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>VANCE: There were some problems between the federal forces and the National
                    Guard, but they were basically at command level and not between the troops
                    themselves because they were in different parts of town. But General
                    Throckmorton, when the federal troops came in, as one does in a situation like
                    this, took over all command of all forces—including the National Guard forces
                    which were federalized.</p>
                <p>Quite frankly, the leadership of a number of officers of the National Guard was
                    inadequate, and, as a result of that, problems developed which had to be dealt
                    with and dealt with strongly, as General Throckmorton properly did. This did
                    lead to some tensions, but it was absolutely necessary that such action be
                    taken. I made certain recommendations to the Kerner Commission and to the
                    Department of Defense with respect to the National Guard, both in terms of
                    training, in terms of qualifications of officers, and the need to review the
                    qualifications of officers in the Guard, and with respect to increasing the
                    number of black and other minority members of the Guard, as a result of the
                    lessons which we learned in Detroit. We found the fire discipline of the guard
                    was unsatisfactory; that they were increasing the tensions by indiscriminate
                    firing rather than using the tactics which the federal forces used, which was
                    not to fire unless it was absolutely necessary to do so.</p>
                <p>This now has become accepted practice. We recommended it in the final report made
                    after the Detroit situation, and that is accepted now as standard practice, I
                    think, in all riot control situations by the federal forces. We proved, in my
                    judgement, that this was the right course of action to take by what happened in
                    Washington where I went during the Washington riots. Some people criticize it on
                    the basis that this leads to undue looting. I personally feel that it's better
                    to save a life than to shoot a fourteen-year old kid who's taking a loaf of
                    bread, and I think that by and large most police chiefs now agree with that. I
                    believe that they arrived at this conclusion almost unanimously at a recent
                    meeting of the police chiefs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of these tactical problems involving the Guard get
                        up to Presidential level?</hi>

                <p>VANCE: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: We solved them right on the ground, Johnny Throckmorton and myself.</p>

                <p>VANCE: Every morning he and I would talk with each other while I stayed in
                    Detroit, when I would usually give him a report. He would usually call me, or I
                    would report in to him at seven o'clock in the morning. We would talk from seven
                    to seven-thirty about the situation and my evaluation of how it was going, so
                    that I did keep in very close touch with him from that standpoint, although we
                    weren't talking about tactical decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Kerner Commission did come pretty directly out of

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, he arrived at the Kerner Commission idea that was his idea. He called
                    me about it and asked me what I thought, and I said I thought it was a good
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he consult with you regarding membership of that

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: My recollection is that he mentioned a few names to me of the kinds of
                    people that he intended to put on it, and I said that they sounded like good
                    names to me. I don't think we had detailed discussions about the
                    individuals.</p>

                <p>VANCE: I participated in a number of press conferences in Detroit and once in
                    Washington when I came back to report to the President, which I believe was the
                    same day as the Kerner Commission first assembled.</p>

                </p>
                <p>You were appointed, I think, on a small panel—a six-man panel or something—on the
                    urban problems right in this general time period?</p>
                <p>VANCE: No. What happened afterwards is that I was asked to be one of the
                    incorporators of the Urban Institute, and a small panel consisting of Irwin
                    Miller as chairman, R. J. Miller, Robert McNamara, McGeorge Bundy, Dick
                    Neustadt, myself, and Kermit Gordon acted as the incorporators of the Urban
                    Institute. In the process [we] decided what kind of an organization it should
                    be, how it should be structured, and it now as you know is a going
                    organization.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the President involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: He made the appointment of the original trustees. He approved our
                    recommendations with respect to the structuring of the Urban Institute.</p>
                <p>He felt very strongly the need for an urban institute to coordinate the research
                    required in the field of urban affairs to provide assistance to the federal
                    government in this area; and to act as a problem solver for the government as
                    well as director of long-term basic research; and to provide assistance also to
                    the states and cities, which is the basic responsibility of the Urban
                    Institute.</p>
                <p>I think that's about all we've got time for this morning unless you've got
                    one—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do have one more because one of the major books on the
                        Johnson Administration is out and makes the point that one of his chief
                        failings is just that he didn't understand metropolitan problems. You talked
                        to him thirty minutes on the telephone for two weeks during a riot—what do
                        you think about that implication that Mr. Goldman has made the basis of a

                    situation to draw conclusions about what Mr. Goldman said. I have not read
                    Goldman's book so I don't know what his charges or statements are with respect
                    to the President's understanding of the urban problems. Really I find it sort of
                    hard to comment on without knowing what it said.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding Cyprus first, I've been told in the course of
                        this project, I think I can say without violating any confidence, that
                        you're one of the few men in the world who can tell his grandchildren that
                        he actually prevented a war—in the case of the Cyprus controversy. How did
                        that mission arise, and what were the circumstances that sent you
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I first heard about the possibility of being sent to Cyprus the day before
                    Thanksgiving. I was sitting in this office, and at about eleven-thirty I
                    received a call from Nick Katzenbach in the State Department. Nick asked me how
                    I would like to go to Ankara. I thought he was joking and asked him what he
                    really called about. He said, “I'm not joking.” He said, “I'm serious. You may
                    have seen that the Cyprus situation has heated up again, and there is a
                    possibility that we may want to send you to Cyprus with the first stop being
                    Ankara.”</p>
                <p>I said, “If you're really serious, I don't see how I can possibly do it. I'm
                    terribly busy at this point. What sort of time pressure is there?”</p>
                <p>He said, “The time pressure is immense, and if it's decided that you should go,
                    you'll be going this afternoon.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Eleven-thirty in the morning. I asked him further about the situation, and
                    he filled me in as to the events, which had somehow not caught the public
                    attention. I had recalled seeing something on page ten of the New York Times
                    that morning—nothing on the front page—so that I was really quite surprised to
                    hear from Nick that the situation was as serious as it appeared to be.</p>
                <p>As we talked further he indicated to me that the most recent analysis indicated
                    that there was a strong possibility that the Turks might be going to invade
                    Cyprus the following day. He said that they were checking their information
                    further, and that if this checked out then the situation was indeed a desperate
                    one.</p>

                    President felt that I could do the job, and said I would first, however, have to
                    check with my partners and let them know what was in the offing.</p>

                    before Thanksgiving, a great many of my partners were not around so I found it
                    hard to find some of my partners to talk with them. But I did indeed talk to a
                    couple of them, and they fully agreed that if the President wanted me to go and
                    with the situation being as grave as it appeared to be, that I should go.
                    Accordingly at about twelve-fifteen I called Nick back and told him that I had
                    checked with my partners and if the President decided that he did want me to go,
                    then I would be prepared to do so.</p>
                <p>I went out to lunch over at Dillon, Read and got a call at lunch from Nick saying
                    that Secretary Rusk and the President had met further, and that they did want me
                    to go to Cyprus, and that a cable was being sent to the capitals involved
                    requesting permission for me to come as the personal emissary of the President.
                    Nick also indicated that U Thant was going to send a personal representative;
                    Mr. [Jose] Rolz-Bennett was to be that individual, and that he would be leaving
                    some time later in the day as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: From here. Rolz-Bennett was going to go to Nicosia, whereas it was
                    proposed that I would go to Ankara and Athens, and then subsequently to Nicosia.
                    I asked Nick what the time schedule was, and he said that I should be out at
                    Kennedy by no later than four o'clock; that they were going to have a plane
                    there; that Luke Battle would be flying up to fill me in on the latest
                    information; and that I would have a small staff consisting of John Walsh, who
                    was the Deputy to Ben Read in the Secretariat, and one Turkish expert and one
                    Greek expert, plus a secretary. I told Nick that size staff sounded ideal, that
                    I didn't want any larger staff and that I would look forward to seeing Luke
                    later in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>I then called my wife, who was packing my suitcase to go down and visit one of my
                    daughters at school for the Thanksgiving holiday. I told her that I would meet
                    her at La Guardia Airport to pick up my bag, but that I was not going down to
                    Washington and Virginia to see our daughter, but on the other hand was going to
                    the Eastern Mediterranean. After a considerable silence she finally accepted the
                    fact that I was not joking and that indeed I was going to the Eastern
                    Mediterranean some time that afternoon.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I drove out to La Guardia and picked up my bag from my wife and went on out to
                    Kennedy. I waited at Kennedy for an hour-and-a-half or so because the plane had
                    trouble taking off from Andrews and was late arriving. It got into Kennedy some
                    time after five, and I then got on the plane and talked to Luke Battle for about
                    an hour or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the only briefing you got, right there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That was the only briefing I got from Luke. Subsequently on the way over
                    on the plane I read all of the cables to bring me up to date and discussed the
                    situation in detail throughout the entire flight to Ankara with John Walsh and
                    the two other staff members who were among our group. While we were waiting at
                    Kennedy for an okay from Ankara that they would receive me, Luke checked in to
                    find out what was happening at the U.N. and we received confirmation of the fact
                    that Rolz-Bennett had already departed for Nicosia. The okay from Athens had
                    come in and from Nicosia, but the okay from Ankara was long overdue. Finally at
                    about six as I recall it, or six-thirty, we got word that Ankara had said that
                    they would receive me. That meant it was about one o'clock in the morning Ankara
                    time. I think there is about seven hours difference between the two.</p>
                <p>The information that Luke gave me indicated that what Nick had said earlier
                    appeared to be true, and that the best information which the United States
                    government had is that the Turks plan to launch an invasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which would be that same day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Which would have been that morning at daybreak. Apparently the delay in
                    giving the okay for me to come to Ankara was in some way related to the various
                    activities which may have been underway at that time.</p>
                <p>We flew nonstop from Kennedy to Ankara and upon arrival were routed into a
                    fighter airstrip. The Turkish government indicated that they did not believe it
                    would be safe for an American representative to land at the regular airport
                    because of the intense feelings which existed in Turkey at the time. People had
                    recollections, according to the Turks, of the 1964 crisis at which time the
                    United States took a strong position which caused some severe repercussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not associated with that personally though, were
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, I was not associated with that personally.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>We landed about first light at the fighter strip outside of Ankara, and the pilot
                    incidentally did a superb job. He had never been into this airfield before, it
                    was a cold winter's day with snow all around. He brought it in and landed on a
                    fighter strip, and it was an absolutely superb job. Incidentally, it would have
                    been absolutely impossible to carry out the mission with the recurring trips
                    back and forth between the various capitals at all hours of the night and day
                    without the superb help of the two crews which were flying the KC 135 which we
                    used throughout the mission. They did an absolutely superb job. That plus the
                    communications which were available were both absolutely essential ingredients
                    of a successful mission, or a reasonably successful mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your communications hookup? Was it to the White
                        House, or was it to the NEA Bureau at State, or—?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Through the command center to the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were getting your instructions through Battle's
                        bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: The only instructions that I had when I left were from the President, and
                    they were to do everything within my power to try and prevent a war. They said
                    that there would be further instructions arriving later, but there was really
                    only one essential instruction and that was to use my best efforts to see that a
                    war was averted.</p>
                <p>On the way to Ankara we discussed the strategy to be used and concluded that with
                    the limited time available to us, that it was absolutely essential to find if
                    possible an agreement between the Greeks and the Turks as the two principal
                    protagonists and then try to get the Cypriots to agree to the basic
                    understanding which might be reached between Greece and Turkey. It was simply
                    impossible within the limited time available to get all three people on board at
                    the same time.</p>
                <p>Inasmuch as the people whose troops would be used were the Greeks and the Turks,
                    we decided that this is where we should concentrate our efforts. We further
                    decided that what we should attempt to do was to find out what the essential
                    position of each of the two countries was and then see if there was common
                    ground which might provide the basis for an understanding. We further decided
                    that we would not attempt to mediate until we reached the conclusion that there
                    was not a basis for common ground in their stated positions. Accordingly, we
                    then went through several days of shuttling back and forth between the two
                    capitals trying to communicate the position of each to the other in an effort to
                    find a common ground which might provide the basis for a settlement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you discover that the Turks had, in fact, been
                        prepared to invade that morning and had stopped because of your mission, or
                        had our information been not correct in that regard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I was never able to really tie it down to my satisfaction. My feeling is,
                    however, that it probably was correct that they were about to invade that
                    morning.</p>
                <p>After two trips back and forth to the two capitals, Ankara and Athens, I
                    concluded that it would be impossible to get either country to agree to the
                    other's position, and therefore decided that we should take the mediator's role
                    and propose a four-point settlement which appeared to me to give each its
                    essential needs and at the same time provide a face-saving device which would
                    permit both countries to climb back from the limbs which they had gotten
                    themselves on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You devised this four-point program yourself, on the
                        scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes. Together with the assistance and advice of our Ambassadors in Ankara
                    and in Athens, they were Phil [Phillips] Talbot [in Greece] and Pete [Parker T.]
                    Hart [in Turkey]. Incidentally they and Toby [Taylor G.] Belcher [Arab. to
                    Cyprus] as well as all the members of the various missions performed
                    superbly.</p>
                <p>We took the proposal back to Ankara, and presented it to the Turkish government.
                    Their initial reaction was favorable. They said they would have to consult with
                    their Cabinet and with the opposition leaders and would be back in touch with
                    us. That was early in the morning when they said that. The day dragged on. We
                    heard that the meetings were being held with the opposition leaders, but we
                    received no call from the Foreign Minister [Ihsan S.] Caglayangil or others in
                    the Turkish government that they were prepared to pick up the conversations
                    again. This dragged on into the evening and it was not until a little after
                    midnight that we heard from the Foreign Minister. It had become apparent because
                    of the delay that they had run into some kind of trouble, and this became
                    crystal clear when we arrived at the Foreign Minister's office some time after
                    one o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p>We sat in one room, John Walsh and I and Pete Hart, together with Caglayangil and
                    his very able assistant, who incidentally now is the Turkish Ambassador to
                    Greece, and negotiated with the Turkish Cabinet which was sitting in the next
                    room. It was one of the most agonizing negotiations I have ever had anything to
                    do with because we were negotiating with twenty-some individuals, each of whom
                    had apparently strong convictions, and it made it awfully difficult to
                    accomplish anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were also doing it secondhand, which didn't help
                        anything, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>VANCE: Right. We would receive suggestions for modifications of the basic
                    four-point document, and we would then discuss them with the Foreign Minister
                    and either accept them or make suggestions for their change, and these would
                    then be taken in by either the Foreign Minister or Turkoman and discussed with
                    the Cabinet. Then they would come back and report to us what the result had
                    been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This still hadn't been presented to the Greeks at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, it had not been presented to the Greeks. [To] each suggestion that was
                    made by the Turks I responded in terms of what I thought was feasible and fair,
                    keeping in mind what the Greek reaction would be as I saw it, having talked with
                    them over a period of days back and forth—because what I was trying to do was to
                    find a middle ground that would be acceptable to both.</p>
                <p>At one point during the night we came to a sticking point on the time the Turks
                    were demanding for the withdrawal of all the Greek forces above the treaty
                    minimum from the island of Cyprus, and the Turks were seeking what to me was an
                    unrealistic and unreasonable time period. So I asked specifically to meet with
                    the Prime Minister [Suleyman] Demirel, and we had a very difficult session which
                    culminated in his going back to his Cabinet and coming back with a modification
                    in the time which seemed to me possible to reach agreement on.</p>
                <p>We concluded our session at about seven o'clock that morning, having worked
                    throughout the night, and left with a somewhat mutilated and hardly articulate
                    document to take back to Athens. We went back to the residence and picked up our
                    shaving stuff and took off immediately for Athens.</p>
                <p>When we arrived back in Athens we met promptly with Foreign Minister [Panayiotis]
                    Pipinelis who took the document for his perusal and for consultation with the
                    Greek Cabinet and the King. As you know, agreement was reached with one or two
                    minor modifications on the document which I brought back from Ankara, and this
                    formed the basis for the ultimate settlement.</p>
                <p>The problem then arose as to how we were going to get [Archbishop] Makarios [III]
                    on board, and we discussed that among ourselves at some length, and then our
                    group took off for Nicosia.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I might say that throughout all of this John Walsh was a tower of
                    strength. He was the one who was the basic draftsman of our cables reporting to
                    Washington. He would do the first draft on the aircraft flying back and forth
                    between the capitals so that we would have it typed and in final form when we
                    arrived and thus were able to keep Washington fairly well clued in on a current
                    basis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. We merely reported what we were doing, and assumed that if they felt
                    that we were not proceeding in a satisfactory fashion they would let us know.
                    But time was so much of the essence that there simply was not the time to report
                    back and wait for instructions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, the coup had taken place before that, and the government was a
                    government basically being run by the current Greek leadership. It had a
                    civilian Prime Minister at that time, but the real power lay in the hands of the
                    military.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: They did not mention that at any time. I'm sure it's probably a factor
                    that operated in their evaluation and their thinking about the problem. I think
                    they became convinced that they were faced with the prospect of war between
                    Turkey and Greece, with all the dreadful consequences that that would mean for
                    their country, for NATO, and for the peace of the Eastern Mediterranean. So that
                    the factor which you have referred to was only, in my judgement, one of the many
                    factors that was weighed in their conclusion that they should try and find a way
                    to settle the matter and pull back from the brink of war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, Mr. Brosio was there. We reached an agreement that inasmuch as we—the
                    United States—had been first in Ankara and Athens that we should take the
                    laboring oar, and that the others would assist in every way which was necessary.
                    I must say that the cooperation between Rolz Bennett, Mr. Brosio, and all of the
                    others could not have been better. I look back with great interest and pleasure
                    in seeing that it was possible to have a mediation and negotiation involving
                    three different organizations, each having a part to play, and involving three
                    different countries, and it was possible to integrate all of them and for each
                    to contribute to the common end. I think that's the most satisfying part of the
                    whole operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Russian presence in the middle of it that was
                        either positive or negative?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>VANCE: The Russians did not play an important part. They only appeared at one
                    time on the scene. They made a statement to the effect that should war come
                    about that they would give support, and by that I believe they meant logistic
                    support, to the Turks. But other than one meeting which took place in Ankara
                    between the Russian Ambassador and the Turkish government, they did not appear
                    to be playing an important role in the controversy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the participants think that the United States was
                        genuinely impartial as between the two of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think that they did. At first, I don't believe that they felt that. I
                    think that the Turks were very suspicious at the outset. They thought that we
                    were coming to slap their wrists and to interfere in what they considered to be
                    their internal problems, but I think as time went on they became convinced that
                    the United States was seeking the common desire of all, namely to preserve the
                    peace of the Eastern Mediterranean, and to prevent our good friends, the Turks
                    and the Greeks as well as the Cypriots, from becoming embroiled in a conflict
                    that could mean nothing but misery and hardship for all concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk to Mr. Johnson about all of this when you
                        came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did see him then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Oh, I did indeed, and reported at length to him when I came back. He was
                    superb all the way through this. One of the things that made it possible to
                    accomplish what was accomplished—and I think that people give us more credit
                    than we deserve—I think that really basically both countries found themselves in
                    a situation where they had gone too far and both were looking for a way to
                    withdraw, and we were merely able to act as the agent or intermediary which
                    facilitated this process. But President Johnson was absolutely superb. He never
                    tried to dictate in any way the details of what was going on, but gave full
                    support to our activities. His encouragement was invaluable during many bleak
                    periods when it looked as though everything were going to fall apart and no
                    settlement would be possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in touch while you were in Ankara or Athens with
                        the White House ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Not personally, but word would come through from the State Department
                    speaking on behalf of the Secretary and the President. This was helpful to
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like a remarkable freedom for a negotiator in
                        the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It really was extraordinary, just extraordinary. And the fact that the
                    President was willing to give that much authority to a negotiator in the field
                    is to me perfectly extraordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he do the same thing in the Korean mission in early
                        1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that one come up? That was sort of a quick one,
                        also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, that came up just about the same way. I got a call from Dean Rusk
                    that time, as I recall it. I knew that we had a crisis because the Pueblo had
                    been seized, and there had also been the attack on the so-called Blue House,
                    which is the Presidential palace. Secretary Rusk asked me if I would be prepared
                    to go to Korea should it become necessary. He said that they had received a
                    recommendation from the Ambassador Bill [William J.] Porter and from [Gen.
                    Charles H.] Tic Bonesteel, who was our U.N. commander in Korea, saying that they
                    felt that the situation was getting terribly tense and that it would be helpful
                    to have a Presidential emissary come and talk directly with [Chung Hee]
                    Park.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to calm Park down, or to try and get some—?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Primarily to do two things. First, to prevent any precipitate action in
                    terms of a move to the North by Park and the Republic of Korea's army; and
                    secondly, to talk with Park about the kinds of assistance which the United
                    States was prepared to give. So it was a double barreled set of objectives that
                    we were being asked to discuss with Park and his Cabinet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk to Mr. Johnson this time before you
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, I did. I talked to him about two hours before I left. He called me on
                    the phone and wished me good luck. I then took off and caught the plane here in
                    New York, again with John Walsh, whom I had asked to have with me, and a couple
                    of others. We flew to Anchorage and refueled and then on to Seoul where we began
                    our around-the-clock sessions with President Park and the Foreign Minister and
                    other members of his Cabinet discussing the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was President Johnson prepared to do? I know he did
                        announce a hundred million dollars and some airplanes were sent in. Was he
                        prepared to do more than that, anything necessary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. President Johnson was prepared to provide a hundred million dollars of
                    military assistance. He was terribly concerned that President Park might take
                    some action in terms of a military move across the demilitarized zone into the
                    North which could precipitate a war, and he made it very clear to me that
                    President Park should be under no illusions as to the seriousness of any such
                    action; and that if such a step were taken without full consultation with the
                    United States that the whole relationships between our countries would have to
                    be reevaluated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a case like that, I know Park is one of the Chiefs of
                        State that apparently Mr. Johnson had a very good personal relationship
                        with—does that kind of thing pay off in a crisis such as this was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It certainly does, and I think this is the reason why the Ambassador and
                    General Bonesteel felt that it was important to have somebody coming as the
                    emissary of President Johnson, because Park had great respect for President
                    Johnson. When the President sent somebody to come and speak on his behalf, Park
                    listened in a fashion that he could not or would not do for the people who were
                    on the ground and there all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The situation was as tense as reported—our intelligence
                        was good in that case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, it was terribly tense, and this became clear to us as soon as we got
                    there and discussed it with Bill Porter and Tic Bonesteel and members of their
                    staffs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it wasn't really an attempt to get an agreement, in
                        the sense of a document, so much as just a personal—?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>VANCE: No. It was, as I said, to convey a clear message to him concerning any
                    military action, and that message was that there could be no military action
                    against the North without prior consultation with the United States, and that we
                    felt very strongly that no such action should be taken; and that the
                    negotiations with respect to the crew of the Pueblo should continue with the
                    Americans meeting with the North Koreans without the South Koreans present. This
                    was another one of the matters which we discussed with and received the approval
                    of President Park to continue. We felt this was very important because we felt
                    that to bring the South Koreans into the discussion at this point might
                    jeopardize the success of the discussions. President Park agreed to this, and we
                    kept him fully informed—the Embassy kept him fully informed at all times—on what
                    had taken place as soon as each meeting at Panmunjom was terminated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't connected with those meetings at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, I was not. So that he was fully clued in at all times on all
                    conversations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not a party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: But not a party. This caused a good deal of pain for Park in his country,
                    because members of the opposition party attacked him for permitting discussion
                    of matters affecting Korea—the Republic of Korea—to be going on without Koreans
                    being present. So he showed considerable courage in going along with our request
                    to abstain from being present at those meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to Vietnam, you were there for quite a long time
                        during the time when the major decisions were made. How close were you as
                        Deputy Secretary to the Presidential decision-making? You did attend the NSC
                        meetings. Did you attend the Tuesday Luncheon regularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Well, no, I did not attend regularly. I attended I believe most NSC
                    meetings, I didn't attend all of them, but I did attend most of them.</p>
                <p>By the way, how long do you think this will go on, because if we get into this
                    one it may take a long while and I wonder if we oughtn't to have another session
                    if you could on this alone?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I can. That would be fine with me.</hi>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>VANCE: Because I think we're going to have to cut it too short, and Vietnam is
                    just going to take a long, long while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can tell that it will go beyond, well, at least beyond
                        this tape. It will probably take a full session.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think it will take a full session. My guess is that it will take an
                    hour-and-a-half or so to do the whole Vietnam thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we just stop then and have another session
                        for Vietnam only?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: That's fine with me.</p>
