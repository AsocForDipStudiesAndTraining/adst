                <p>AMBASSADOR WILLIAM H. G. FITZGERALD</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 14, 1994</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I'd like to start at the beginning. When
                        and where were you born, and could you tell me a little about your
                        family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Yes. I was born in the old Lying in Hospital in Boston, now the
                    Brigham and Women's Hospital, December 23, 1909. However, we lived in Wakefield,
                    Massachusetts for the early part of my life. My father was a naval officer. My
                    mother and he decided that, rather than try to follow him around to various
                    positions around the world, they would establish a base where the children,
                    including my sister and myself, would be brought up and educated. We lived there
                    for a number of years, during which time I attended a religious school, operated
                    by the Jesuits. My father wanted me to go to the Naval Academy and follow him
                    into the Navy, so I went to preparatory school in Maryland, the Severn
                    School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're fellow alumni. I went there for one year, anyway,
                        1940-41.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I was there when Roland Teal was founder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was still the principal when I was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Was he? I went there and then entered the Naval Academy in 1927.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in the Class of '31.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Class of '31 at the Naval Academy, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the education at the Naval Academy in those
                        days, did you get any inkling of what the big world was like outside? I'm
                        particularly thinking of international affairs, because this is the focus of
                        our interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>FITZGERALD: When I entered the Academy, I must say, my vision was quite
                    parochial. I studied with the purpose of being a naval officer and pursuing that
                    career. I wished to achieve command as quickly as possible, so the way to
                    proceed along that course was to be assigned to small ships. However, when you
                    graduate, you are generally assigned to large ships, battleships in particular,
                    to begin your training in the various departments of a ship. As quickly as
                    possible, I requested submarine service but the earliest possible time was 1932,
                    when I was assigned to submarine school at New London. I graduated in 1933 and
                    was assigned duty in Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii.</p>
                <p>At that time, the Navy was contracting. When I entered the service, we had an
                    incredibly small inventory of ships. If I recall (don't hold me to this number),
                    I don't think we had more than 100 ships actually in commission. One hundred
                    ships. There was no more than 500,000 total complement in the Navy, officers and
                    enlisted personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking, of course, of the depths of the Depression,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Quite. I saw little prospect of advancing quickly, but I became
                    qualified in submarine command. Following this experience, I had different ideas
                    for my future and left the service in the summer of 1934 to attend the Harvard
                    Law School.</p>
                <p>I had become very much interested in the stock market, which interest was
                    stimulated when I was aboard my first ship, based in San Pedro, the battleship
                    USS Nevada. This ship was later sunk in Pearl Harbor, but in four years was
                    again operative and was the lead ship in the invasion of Normandy. But during
                    that time on the Nevada, among several assignments, I was the assistant
                    navigator. There were many yachtsmen around California at that time who knew
                    nothing about coastal navigation, and so were interested to have a naval officer
                    who had navigational experience to cruise with them. I was invited on several
                    occasions to join some of these people.</p>
                <p>One particular time was the weekend of July 4, 1932, when I was sailing with a
                    group comprising one of the leading Hollywood producers, an experienced broker
                    in Los Angeles, and others. While we were cruising down the coast towards San
                    Diego, this broker, was almost in tears as he told the people on board the
                    incredible situation in the stock market. “I can point out companies which are
                    selling on the Stock Exchange for less than the cash they have in their
                    treasuries, not counting any fixed assets or inventory.” I listened and decided
                    to do something about it. This was an extraordinary opportunity for
                    investing.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I had accumulated the total capital of $900 and so invested it in the stock
                    market, beginning July 7, 1932 on a 10% margin basis. At that time, all one
                    needed to invest was ten percent of the capital cost of the security. I invested
                    from 1932 to 1935 in a strong bull market. When I was at Harvard Law School in
                    1934, I was trading in the market almost on a daily basis and was earning more
                    money per week than some of my law review friends on Wall Street at Sullivan and
                    Cromwell or White and Case, etc., were making in a month, possibly in several
                    months. As a result, I became disenchanted with following the law and decided to
                    go into finance.</p>
                <p>Friends of mine arranged for me to be employed by the Borden Company, which was
                    originally the Borden Milk Company to learn corporate finance.</p>
                <p>I remained there until I received a letter from the Department of the Navy in
                    April, 1941, alerting me prior to being called back into the service. Most
                    people thought that World War II began at Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, but as
                    you know from your experience, our Navy was escorting Allied convoys supplying
                    South Africa and parts of Asia beginning in February and March of that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Reuben James and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I was called up in June of '41, and having been involved in
                    submarines, naturally was assigned to that service. I never had the opportunity
                    of going into operational duty, as I was ordered to the Bureau of Ships to
                    assist in submarine research.</p>
                <p>We found at an early period in 1942 that there was something wrong with our depth
                    charges and something wrong with our intelligence concerning German submarines.
                    It was not until late '42, when a German submarine was captured, on the surface,
                    in the English Channel, which revealed that German submarines no longer had
                    riveted hulls, as we had, but high-strength, welded hulls, a completely
                    different submarine design from which we were operating. Our depth charges were
                    set at the maximum of 250 feet, as our own submarines were not able to submerge
                    deeper, but the German submarines could descend to about 400 feet. As a result,
                    we never reached them. Our destroyers and anti-submarine warfare forces would
                    sight a submarine, pursue it with the usual anti-submarine warfare
                    doctrine—depth charges, etc., but never damage it.</p>
                <p>The Navy Department decided that the Bureau of Ships had to redesign submarines
                    literally from square one, basic hull materials, test of materials, etc. We
                    found that passive tests just did not give us the facts. Dynamic and explosive
                    tests had to be developed to measure the strengths of much stronger materials.
                    As a result, a mini-Manhattan Project was conducted by the Navy Department to
                    make our own submarines competitive with the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never heard of this. So that was what you did during
                        most of the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: After this experience, I wished to get out of Washington to an area
                    where the action was with my friends with whom I went through submarine school.
                    They were at that time either commanders of submarines or executive officers of
                    submarine divisions. Here I was, sitting in the Bureau of Ships, trying to
                    figure out how to improve the design of submarines which kept me from seeing
                    action on the war front.</p>
                <p>Finally, I was posted in the chief of naval operations office as a liaison
                    officer with the Latin American navies. Later, I was appointed submarine officer
                    on our naval mission to Brazil.</p>
                <p>The end of the war came, and I returned to Washington, and left the service in
                    1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Upon leaving the service, I still was very much interested in
                    investment. I decided that there were many opportunities in the field of
                    research, through my experience in the Bureau of Ships, which exposed me to the
                    materials and design problems which needed to be resolved. As a result, I
                    organized the Metallurgical Research and Development Company which became active
                    in the field of powder metallurgy. This field of research had a high priority
                    with the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The military was very concerned about
                    manufacturing turbine blading for aircraft and ships, which required
                    high-strength, high-temperature heat resistant materials and enormous costs to
                    machine these engine parts. I thought that, with powder metallurgy, we could
                    make compounds sufficiently strong to withstand high pressure and high
                    temperature and meet the physical requirements in a rather simple manufacturing
                    process. The Army, Navy, and Air Force were intrigued with the idea, so I
                    established the Metallurgical Research and Development Inc. with a laboratory in
                    Paterson, New Jersey, where we did the research on turbine blading. We worked on
                    this project for three years, combining many kinds of materials, compounds, into
                    powder by varying pressures and temperatures. With all of our efforts we could
                    not achieve the complex form of the blades and obtain the high strength needed
                    for those bladings. As a result, the military services and industry redirected
                    the application of powder metallurgy into less sophisticated forms, such as
                    transmission casings for the automotive industry which now has a wide use in
                    that field.</p>
                <p>However, I was interested to learn just recently that some of the scientists and
                    engineers are coming back to powder metallurgy with the idea which I had
                    originally for turbine blading and turbine forms, because, now, they have
                    developed new techniques forming alloyed material under high temperature and
                    pressure — technology which did not exist 40 years ago.</p>
                <p>This was an interesting period in my life, where I became involved in that field
                    of research. Later, I sold the company, as I knew at that time that our
                    objectives could not be reached.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>As a spinoff from that technology, I moved into the vacuum metalizing field where
                    we coated various plastic materials with microthicknesses of aluminum metal.
                    These were made into thread for decorating curtains in gold or silver. Many
                    other uses evolved from this technique. Some friends and I formed a company
                    called National Metalizing Corporation which had great success in this field.
                    Several years later, I left Natural Metalizing when we merged with another
                    corporation in an allied field.</p>
                <p>All during that time from my war years in the Bureau of Ships I had in the back
                    of my mind the problem of slow speed landing craft which were a great failure in
                    World War II. In 1961 I made contact with a German group headed by Baron von
                    Schertel who built 60-mile-per-hour hydrofoils to supply ammunition to General
                    Rommel in Africa. This group interested the Bureau of Ships which supported some
                    research on hydrofoils. The hydrofoil concept received support for several years
                    but the Navy decided that the Hovercraft concept developed by the British Navy
                    was more interesting.</p>
                <p>I had already had contacts in Europe due to the fact that in 1949 my company
                    received the first technical-assistance contract under the Marshall Plan. My
                    corporation was appointed with the American Society of Metals co-manager to
                    organize the first World Metallurgical Congress, in October of 1950 in Detroit,
                    Michigan. While Metallurgical Research organized the major European corporations
                    in the metals and metal equipment industries to participate; the American
                    Society of Metals assembled the American corporations working in similar
                    industries for the meeting. This Congress was a tremendous success as it
                    initiated cross-licensing agreements, acquisitions, financial participation,
                    joint ventures, that impacted heavily on the development of the metals industry
                    in Europe in the post-war period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really, for the first time since the war, brought
                        companies, on an international scale, together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Precisely. Companies in Germany, as Metallgesellschaft, Luergi,
                    Mannesmann, Krupp and Siemens with leading British, French and Italian companies
                    joined. We put them together with US Steel, Bethlehem, and International Steel
                    together with the nonferrous companies and fabricators. It was quite an

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This gave you your real touch of the international.
                        Obviously, German business was just moving out; it was only five years after
                        the war, and the Cold War was just beginning to crank up. What was your
                        impression of the German metal industry, and the managers particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>FITZGERALD: As you know, the German metals industries were important targets for
                    allied aircraft bombing. The cities in western Germany — Dusseldorf, Frankfurt,
                    Munich and Stuttgart, cities which were centers of heavy industry, particularly,
                    were badly hit. The impressive fact was the ability of German industries to
                    recover quickly and to bring into production peacetime product lines. Their
                    recovery period was a fraction of the time required by the British and French
                    corporations. In the early 1950's, as the Marshall Plan developed, these
                    companies were again back in worldwide trade competition, utilizing the best
                    designs of manufacturing processing and production, mostly developed in the
                    U.S.A.</p>
                <p>We enjoyed a model and unusual relationship with the European Cooperation
                    Administration which administered the Marshall Plan. My company received an
                    open-end technical-assistance contract to which ECA, the Mutual Security Agency
                    and later the FOA assigned task orders to work in various countries. In MSA, we
                    were involved in Greece. When the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA)
                    replaced MSA, we were assigned task orders for work in Indonesia and Pakistan.
                    Our company advised on the maintenance and operation of the railroads in
                    Pakistan with headquarters in Rawalpindi. At about the same time we received an
                    economic development contract in Nepal. Over a period of seven years we were
                    assigned development contracts in various countries in Asia.</p>
                <p>In 1957 Christian Herter, who at that time was deputy secretary of state, knew me
                    and my work in various aid projects with the ECA, MSA, and FOA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was at one time governor of Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Yes, he had been governor of Massachusetts, but later he came to
                    Washington and Foster Dulles appointed him as his deputy secretary of state.</p>
                <p>Chris Herter called me one day, and he said, “You know, you've been on the other
                    side of the table negotiating with ECA, MSA, FOA, etc., and now we have ICA.
                    Would you like to come into the government and help us in some of these
                    projects, because you've seen the other side? Will you join us on our side of
                    the fence?”</p>
                <p>I replied, “I'd be honored to come in and try to help.” And President Eisenhower
                    appointed me as deputy director for management of the International Cooperation
                    Administration (ICA).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, for the record, from 1958 to 1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I came in first in 1957. Governor Herter asked me to look over the
                    operation so I came in as assistant to the director. They gave me an opportunity
                    to range all over the ICA. In 1958 President Eisenhower appointed me deputy
                    director for management. I remained in the job until 1960 when I resigned to
                    work for Richard Nixon who was running for president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about this time. What was your impression
                        of ICA? You were basically in a management position; this is what they were
                        using you for. What were the strengths and the weaknesses, as you saw it at
                        that time during this '58 to '60 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: After I had that experience from 1957 to 1960, I wrote a critique
                    indicating that we are approaching aid in the wrong way, throwing millions and
                    millions of dollars at the heads of governments — military dictatorships,
                    Marxist/Leninist leaders, government planners and socialist-leaning governments.
                    Our aid was not reaching the people. We could not account for much of the aid
                    money as it had disappeared mostly to Switzerland, France and Monaco. I stated
                    further that our aid program was not aid on a loan basis as represented but we
                    were selling millions of tons of grain to various countries — India, Pakistan
                    and others — at a fixed price with a fixed currency value. As a result, we were
                    giving away the grain and commodities to these countries as they were suffering
                    under an inflation rate of ten, 20, 30 percent a year. These long-term payouts
                    in local currencies became gifts. I wrote that it was a great mistake for us to
                    lose millions of dollars in these grain deals with no hope of utilizing the
                    depreciated local currencies paid in by these countries.</p>
                <p>The State Department insisted that we had to maintain these agreements as we were
                    competing with the Soviets for influence in many of these countries. If the
                    United States believed that a particular project did not make sense unless
                    carried out our way, the prospective client beneficiary would say, “Well, we'll
                    go to the Russians and they will give us the funds.”</p>
                <p>This was a problem which the State Department was facing at the time and there
                    was strong feelings that the US had to give aid to these African and Asian
                    countries in an attempt to maintain influence.</p>
                <p>I was very unhappy with this policy, so resigned and went to work in the campaign
                    for Nixon. When Nixon was defeated and Kennedy became president, I went back to
                    business.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>At that time, I became involved with hydrofoils and became chairman of Supramar
                    Ltd. of Luzern, Switzerland. As I related earlier, the Navy was very interested
                    in high speed landing craft but our landing craft designs had improved very
                    little since 1945. I negotiated a license with General Dynamics Corporation to
                    build Supramar hydrofoils for a period of five years. GD paid the license fee
                    each year but did not build Supramar hydrofoils. It happened that the Bureau of
                    Ships was attempting to build their own hydrofoil and did not want competition
                    from foreign sources. General Dynamics being part of the Navy “shipbuilding
                    club” acceded to the Bureau of Ships' wishes. As I indicated above, the Navy
                    decided to later support the Hovercraft principle developed by the British Navy
                    for future landing craft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the Bureau of Ships, with a
                        combination of unions and shipping companies, just didn't want to have
                        something new like a German hydrofoil come in to the United States as it
                        could have not only military but many commercial domestic transport
                        uses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Yes, that's exactly it. I remember Admiral James, who was chief of
                    the Bureau of Ships at that time, a friend of mine from war days in the Bureau
                    of Ships, say to me, “We're going to build the best goddamned hydrofoil in the
                    world. We don't need these Krauts to build hydrofoils.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The result was that we built very expensive models which
                        have never really been used.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Correct. They priced themselves out of the marketplace with high-tech
                    craft built by General Dynamics and Lockheed Aircraft trying to transport people
                    on a commercial basis. They just didn't realize that these were simple boats,
                    with a foil system which is not complex in producing. They designed aircraft
                    control systems — far beyond the cost of European hydrofoil systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're out of the hydrofoil business now. Walk through
                        what you did, and then we'll get to where you were involved with foreign
                        affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Of course, being in ECA, MSA, FOA, then ICA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which now is AID; it keeps changing its name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: ICA was the forerunner of AID and active in over 70 countries at that
                    time. I had the opportunity of traveling all over the world...where programs
                    were operating and trying to make political and economic sense in these
                    countries up to 1960.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>During these years, on my off hours, as an individual, I was investing in various
                    companies in the stock market. Then I became involved in money management of the
                    Chase funds in Boston for a period of years.</p>
                <p>It was not until quite a bit later, when Ford succeeded Nixon, that I was
                    appointed as US Conciliator, International Center of Investment Disputes
                    1975-1982 and President's Advisory Board on International Investments
                    1976-1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon came in, in 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I had no appointment during the Nixon Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can always fill this in. The major thing is, we want to
                        talk about the foreign-affairs side of this. I note that you went as a
                        delegate to the Atlantic Treaty Assembly at various times, in Iceland and
                        Washington, Rome, Istanbul. This Atlantic Treaty Assembly, what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I've been identified with the Atlantic Council of the United States
                    for many years beginning in 1976. I was treasurer from 1979 to 1992 and am
                    presently vice chairman of the Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, for the historian, what is your impression of the
                        role of the Atlantic Council during this period, from the 1970s to the
                        1990s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: The Atlantic Council is a nonprofit public policy center addressing
                    the advancement of US global interests within the Atlantic and Pacific
                    communities. A national, nonpartisan organization, the Council actively engages
                    in its activities the US executive and legislative branches, the national and
                    international business community, media and academia; and diplomats and foreign
                    leaders. In the beginning, the Council was very much concerned with East-West
                    security and how to control the Soviet Union's expansion. The Atlantic Council
                    was essentially a think tank for these problems, providing the State Department
                    and the different administrations, and departments of government with proposals
                    or approaches to various security problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The Council's mission was more or less constant and continuous until the ''80s,
                    when the whole problem of eastern Europe, and the Berlin Wall, was completely
                    shifted in focus. The Atlantic Council started broadening its approach, looking
                    at the Pacific area. Now the Atlantic Council has expanded its base of objective
                    analysis to cover not only European security problems, but those of the Far East
                    as well. It is very actively involved with negotiations with China, Japan, and
                    Korea on security and energy problems. The possible extension of NATO to the
                    east has initiated a number of studies involving security. These Atlantic Treaty
                    Association meetings were concerned with the Soviet Union and east-west security
                    until the last one which I attended in Athens. Our meeting in Athens included
                    the Bulgarians, the Romanians, and the Hungarians, all present pleading their
                    case for admission into NATO. The function of the Atlantic Council, being
                    participants in the Atlantic Treaty Association meetings, was to develop
                    position papers, which were put together after each meeting and sent to NATO,
                    our Congress, Departments of Government and our Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And many of the members on the Atlantic Council have also
                        been in government, so it's not an academic, artsy-fartsy type of
                        organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Oh, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, members have held very
                    important jobs in government: secretaries of state, deputy secretaries, etc. Why
                    don't I give you a list of people, to give you a feel for the board of
                    directors, that would be helpful.</p>
                <p>Enclosed is a letterhead of the Atlantic Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll have that, yes.Well, now, we're coming to the time
                        when you were appointed ambassador to Ireland. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: In 1989, when President Bush was elected, he asked me whether I'd be
                    interested in some diplomatic assignment. As I was very much involved in
                    business and banking, I just couldn't get away. So he appointed me vice chairman
                    of the African Development Fund, which was an independent government agency
                    having to do with grassroots aid in sub-Sahara Africa, a subject on which I had
                    written a critique in 1960. I accepted with alacrity as it was a part-time
                    assignment and did not interfere with my banking business.</p>
                <p>This fund's mission was to assist in the economic development of the sub-Sahara
                    countries, 42 countries in total, and I was very interested in this grass roots
                    approach to foreign aid. When foreign-aid budgets were being clipped, the
                    African Development Fund was given more money as Congress believed that this was
                    the way to help the people of Africa, beginning at the bottom of the economic
                    ladder and not at the top.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I was very much involved in that work, when the president called me one day and
                    said, “I'd like you to go to Ireland,” without any kind of solicitation, any
                    kind of effort on my part. A complete surprise.</p>
                <p>This off-hand nomination by the president concerned the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee when I came up for approval. As you know, you have to submit your
                    background experience, your financials, how much money you have contributed to
                    political parties during the past five years. Over these years, I had never
                    contributed any substantial amounts, perhaps $1,000 for a dinner or similar
                    functions. In view of having substantial assets and minuscule contributions, the
                    Democratic staff of the committee combed my records for the last five years.
                    They apparently could not believe that I had given so little money to the
                    Republican Party, so demanded that I sign an affidavit stating that my financial
                    contributions to the political system were as I previously stated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Think of that. So I signed it.</p>
                <p>When I came up for confirmation, Senator Sarbanes...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of Maryland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: said, “Mr. FitzGerald, how did you get this nomination?” I replied,
                    “Senator, I do not know as it was a complete surprise to have been asked to go
                    to Ireland.”</p>
                <p>There were three other candidates up at the time, all had their senators, several
                    congressmen also with them, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee what
                    wonderful candidates they were and what a wonderful job they were going to do
                    wherever they were to be posted. There I was alone.</p>
                <p>I said, “Gentlemen, I'm sorry I don't have any senators and I don't have any
                    congressmen to recommend me, because I come from the District of Columbia.”</p>
                <p>They laughed. And Sarbanes said, “Well, I am against these political appointees
                    buying embassies.”</p>
                <p>Sarbanes asked me if I had anyone write letters or intercede on my behalf and I
                    replied, “No, no one.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>They just couldn't find any evidence of other contributions. Finally, I said,
                    “Well, gentlemen, as you see, I have no political recommendations at all.
                    However, when President Eisenhower appointed me in 1957 to the State Department
                    my legal residence was Connecticut, and my sponsor at that time was Senator
                    Prescott Bush.”</p>
                <p>Senator Sarbanes said, “Senator Prescott Bush?” And he looked over at Biden and a
                    couple of others, and he said, “Thank you very much, Mr. FitzGerald. No more
                    questions.”</p>
                <p>No more questions. Isn't that amusing?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out to Ireland from '92 to '93. As you got ready
                        to go out, obviously you read up on it and went to the State Department and
                        all that. Could you talk a little about the preparation for going out to be
                        an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: That is a subject in which I am most interested. I've told Steve Low
                    how much I appreciated, enjoyed and valued the indoctrination training at the
                    FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was head of the FSI at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Yes. Also I told a friend of mine, who was in charge of the
                    indoctrination, Ambassador Brandon Grove, that the staff did a splendid job. I
                    said I would recommend a perhaps more intensive effort on the part of non-career
                    people. There are a number of people (I know them, and you do, too), political
                    appointees, who thought that whatever job they were appointed to they could do
                    and were not particularly interested in the training or preparation. I
                    recommended to Brandon and also to Steve Low, “to set up a training program
                    recognizing that over a period of time, there'll be at least 25, maybe up to 50,
                    percent of the ambassadorial appointments that are political. This training must
                    prepare these people properly as it may not be easy for non-career people to
                    become diplomats. The Department cannot devote enough time in preparing these
                    people. If this program required financial support, I'd be willing to help.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, it's interesting to note that the real
                        impetus behind developing this course, in the beginning, was Shirley Temple
                        Black, who started this. Could you describe a little about some of the areas
                        covered in this course?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>FITZGERALD: The program emphasized the need to know the key people in the
                    government to which they are to be accredited, particularly the people with whom
                    they had to do business, to know them thoroughly as the ambassador has a message
                    to bring to that country from the United States. I felt that I should develop
                    this rapport immediately as soon as I arrived in Ireland. My first objectives
                    were the minister of foreign affairs and the ministers of industry and finance.
                    Hopefully, in the embassies you have good staff who have experience and
                    knowledge of the important members of the host government. The ambassador is the
                    leader of the team and representative of our president and must develop a
                    personal relationship, if possible, with the heads of the government, and
                    through that personal relationship, transmit his interpretation of United States
                    policy so that it is well understood by the leaders of that host government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out to Ireland, were there any particular
                        issues on your plate? What were the main concerns the State Department had
                        with our relations with Ireland when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Well, number one, we looked on the problem of unemployment.
                    Basically, my mission was to develop a US industry investment interest in
                    Ireland. I organized a program (through our Department of Commerce, which has
                    about 67 offices across the United States whose sole purpose is to develop
                    domestic and international business). I attempted to energize those offices,
                    helping them to recognize that there is a universe of corporations in the United
                    States, whose sales range from 50 million dollars to perhaps 100 million dollars
                    a year, which have never exported. Good product, well managed, well financed,
                    never exported. My argument was, “Here is an opportunity in Ireland.” With the
                    fall of the Berlin Wall, hordes of businessmen, lawyers, US Government officials
                    charging into Eastern Europe and Russia where there are no laws yet and it's
                    going to take years before the laws are established and are tested in the courts
                    for repatriation of capital, protection of investment, private property, unfair
                    labor laws, and many other unforeseen problems. Language barriers exist in all
                    of the Eastern European and Slavic nations. I said, “Here we have Ireland, where
                    the people speak the same language and operate under the same English common
                    laws tested over the generations in the courts. We have about 45 millions of
                    Irish-Americans in our country, a strong bridge. Don't look at Ireland from the
                    standpoint of three and a half million population. That's not your market.
                    Ireland is a member of the European Community, and you can use Ireland as a
                    conduit into the largest consumers' market in the world: 370-plus million
                    people.” That was the message.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>And I pushed it. As a matter of fact, we now have over 350 US corporations now
                    operating in Ireland, selling to all markets outside of the United States. Being
                    a banker by trade, I went to the banks and related some personal experiences.
                    “I've talked to a number of young people graduating from the universities, and I
                    asked them what they plan to do after graduation.” One said, 'Well, I think I'm
                    going to get a job in government.' Another one would say, 'Well, I think I'm
                    going to pursue the law.' A third would say, 'Well, I think I'm going into
                    accounting.'” None of those jobs would create employment. I would reply, “Well,
                    why aren't you going out and starting a business?”</p>
                <p>“Well, I can't get any money. Nobody'll give us the money to start a new
                    business.”</p>
                <p>I then went to the banks, to the Allied Irish Banks, the Ulster Bank, the Bank of
                    Ireland, even the Chase Bank representative in Dublin and repeated the story —
                    “Young college graduates tell me they can't get any money.”</p>
                <p>The frequent banker's response was, “Well, nobody comes in with a good idea for
                    us to finance.”</p>
                <p>My reply was, “I'm a banker. Now what do you mean by a good idea? You'll loan
                    somebody $100,000 providing he will secure it with some property of equal value,
                    or compensatory deposits of up to 20 or 25 percent? That isn't loaning money.
                    That's not helping business. What you should be doing is setting up a small
                    department in your bank for venture capital. Look what we do in America. I've
                    been in a venture capital business in Silicon Valley — the center of venture
                    capitalists where seed money goes to somebody who has an idea. You help them
                    organize the business. And then, when you see the idea is successful, you help
                    the person or persons with public financing.”</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, in Ireland, they have a phobia of being a failure for if you go
                    bankrupt in Ireland, historically, you'd never be able to borrow more money.</p>
                <p>You know what I did?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I saw an article in Forbes magazine about people who had gone
                    bankrupt in the United States and who had become millionaires. I made copies of
                    the article and gave it to the Irish government officials in the Ministries of
                    Commerce, Industry, and Finance.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I impressed on the Irish government as to what happened in the ''80s in the
                    United States. We provided more new jobs than all of Europe put together, about
                    15 million jobs. Where did they come from? Eighty to 85 percent came from small
                    business. Small business. That should be your thrust here in Ireland. With US
                    capital coming in, working with the Irish experts developing the niches in the
                    European market, and American business know-how you've got to be successful.” As
                    a result, I've learned from Dermot Gallagher, the Irish Ambassador to the US,
                    that Prime Minister Reynolds announced that the government was setting up an
                    entrepreneurial fund in Ireland to help people start small businesses. Amen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Irish trade with the United States? This
                        was a period when we were making, as we have at other times, complaints that
                        there were unfair trading practices. How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: The problem with Ireland was mostly with agricultural products, which
                    they export to the United States. They're operating, of course, as you know, in
                    the European Community, where they receive very heavy subsidies. They're part of
                    the fusion group, which is Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland. Those four
                    nations are considered developing countries under the European Community mantra,
                    which provides them with heavy subsidies. Presently, Ireland receives more
                    subsidy than all of the others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that we could deal with, while you were
                        there? These subsidies, did this make a difference in trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: We couldn't touch any of the subsidies going to the Irish government.
                    Those were coming from the European Community. And so that was helpful, very
                    helpful, to the Irish. But, the Irish were very afraid that we were going to
                    penalize them when we had this European Community brouhaha with the GATT. We
                    threatened to cut off the agricultural products, casein which they produced from
                    milk among other dairy products, which were important to them, but certainly not
                    important to the United States.</p>
                <p>I think that the thrust is through US investments in Ireland and through
                    developing small business which is going to impact on the unemployment
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I never was involved in the North-South Ireland situation, excepting as an amicus
                    curiae (friend in court). I visited Northern Ireland and had the good
                    opportunity of convening the four leaders of the four political parties in one
                    room. Of course, I did this all with the knowledge of London, because relations
                    with Northern Ireland is the US Embassy in London's responsibility. I visited
                    Belfast because I wanted to at least know the feelings of these Northern Ireland
                    leaders. They all wanted peace but the question was how to get to that point. I
                    suggested that perhaps a little give on either side might help. I knew very well
                    the people who were negotiating, for the Republic of Ireland, and how anxious
                    they are to settle this controversy which has bedeviled both nations for over 50
                    years.</p>
                <p>I hope, now, that they will have some kind of a rapprochement, a working
                    agreement, over a period of time. Remember, since 1922, the Ulster government
                    has been repressing the Catholics. Now that they see the shoe can be on the
                    other foot, they're scared to death that the Irish Catholics will just give the
                    same to them. The most important fact is that the issue is no longer religious,
                    but economic. The United Kingdom has been pouring billions of dollars into
                    Ulster for years. How long this government can continue, I cannot forecast but
                    the issue is more critical as time passes.</p>
                <p>After I met with the heads of these four parties, in one room in Belfast, I went
                    over and had luncheon the next day with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Secretary of
                    State for Northern Ireland who has total responsibility for the negotiations. I
                    advised him of my meeting and the different opinions received. My question to
                    Sir Patrick was, “How long can Westminster continue to support these one and a
                    half million people at such extraordinary levels?” Of course, I was briefed on
                    all U.K.-Ulster relations before my trip to Belfast. Great Britain is pouring in
                    about six billion dollars a year into Ulster containing one and a half million
                    people. Out of that six billion, they estimate about two billion is for military
                    occupation. One of the strong points in any negotiation is that the U.K. holds
                    the purse strings and could force a settlement if necessary.</p>
                <p>My hope is that ultimately it will be one island. This geographic fiction which
                    was created in that northeast corner of Ireland, Ulster, was mostly for wartime
                    security to begin with and also to appease the Protestant population. Great
                    Britain gave Dominion status to Ireland, and this was the quid pro quo. At the
                    time Great Britain's policy was, “We'll keep our boys up there in Ulster. We'll
                    pour the money in and build up industry there, and we will have a Protestant
                    stronghold. Of course, they were always remembering, as you recall, World War I,
                    the neutrality of Ireland, the opposition against England. Ulster was a foothold
                    in Ireland, where the U.K. could have ports, including Londonderry, for shipping
                    and commerce, and maybe for security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, it was denying. Because, during World War I,
                        the Germans made pretty good inroads into the Irish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Yes, they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the 45 million Irish-Americans. How did
                        you find the Irish politics played, as far as your job was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: That is amusing. All my forbears are Irish, and I'm from a part of
                    the Desmond Clan. Desmond, in Gaelic, means South Munster, and South Munster is
                    Limerick area Kerry and Cork. When I first arrived, I was not an unknown
                    quantity, and I became identified pretty quickly, so I was able to talk with
                    Irish government officials not as a stranger.</p>
                <p>Over the years, there's been a strong anti-American bias in the press. The press
                    has been controlled completely by the English up until recently, when Tony
                    O'Reilly is attempting to break in and control some of the Irish press. However,
                    the British control the Irish Times, the Irish Independent with British money.
                    As a matter of fact, the first Irish managing editor ever to be appointed was on
                    the Irish Times when I was on post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Think of that. The first Irish managing editor ever to be appointed
                    to a newspaper in Ireland.</p>
                <p>The Irish, at times, are petulant, they're emotional. They feel that the United
                    States owes them something for sending over from Ireland about 45 million
                    people. It's an interesting love-hate relationship and we're constantly trying
                    to combat this feeling.</p>
                <p>For instance, when Mrs. Robinson, the Irish president, made a great to-do about
                    her concern about Somalia, the government arranged for her to go over to
                    Somalia, with all kinds of photo opportunities such as reaching over and
                    speaking to a starving Somali child, and how wonderful it was that she
                    recognized the importance of Somalia and so on. Well, the United States had been
                    pouring millions of tons of food into Somalia for two years before Mrs. Robinson
                    went to Somalia. I reminded the Irish government of all the aid we were giving,
                    and providing Marines as well to protect the shipments of food to the country.
                    Ireland did not send any food and little else and scarcely mentioned the US
                    aid.</p>
                <p>There came the time when the United States said, we can't do it all and the
                    European Community support is needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Somali operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I went to the Irish minister of foreign affairs, spoke to him about
                    aid to Somalia, pointing out that we had given hundreds of millions, and wanted
                    to know what the Irish were going to do about it. His reply was, “Well, I will
                    have to refer this to the treasury.” Bertie O'Hearn was Irish finance minister
                    at that time. When the word came back, the minister of foreign affairs didn't
                    call me, but his deputy did, and said, “Mr. FitzGerald, as you know, we've done
                    a lot for Somalia. We've allowed transport of American food going through
                    Shannon Airport without charging any commercial airport fees.”</p>
                <p>To this statement I said, “Yes, of course, and you do realize that when all these
                    Americans are pouring through there, they're spending thousands and thousands of
                    dollars shopping in Limerick and in Shannon.”</p>
                <p>There was silence. And then he said, “Well, we've finally decided. As you know,
                    we're very tight in money now. We'll contribute $250,000.</p>
                <p>I didn't say a word and waited a bit, then I said, “$250,000?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Thank you very much. I'll notify President Bush immediately as to
                    your generosity.”</p>
                <p>The Irish see us over here, rich, and they consider us also arrogant. As I said,
                    it's this love-hate relationship, where they feel that they want to be part of
                    our prosperity, and yet they want to be independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminds me a little of the peasants dealing with their
                        rich landlord, always trying to put something over, get something. It's that
                        mentality, in some ways. How did you find dealing with the government?
                        Albert Reynolds was the prime minister at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Oh, yes, I got along very well with him. He's, I thought, a very
                    adept politician. He was a successful businessman, to begin with, before he came
                    into government. He managed to rise in the Fianna Fail Party, over a period of
                    time, and then became prime minister and was elected and reelected.</p>
                <p>In the last election, two years ago, the Labor Party made unusually strong
                    inroads in the Dail parliament. In past years, they generally controlled ten to
                    12 seats, and now they're up to 32 seats. As a result, of the opposing parties,
                    Fianna Fail had 66 seats, Fine Gael had 43, and the Labor Party obtaining 32
                    seats. Reynolds needed the Labor Party as the swing vote.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Dick Spring, who is a very ambitious young man and who is the leader of the Labor
                    Party, went to Albert Reynolds to discuss control of the government. In my
                    opinion, I think Albert Reynolds gave away the store in order to make this
                    coalition with the Labor Party. He allowed Dick Spring to do something which
                    never had happened before, to become deputy prime minister, and minister of
                    foreign affairs!</p>
                <p>He forced out David Andrews, who was a first-class minister of foreign affairs
                    with whom I became very friendly, into another cabinet job, which was fisheries
                    and defense. Reynolds asked Andrews to take that job over. Andrews told me,
                    “Well, this is a job where I'm going to become minister of fish and chips.” Fish
                    and chips. A wonderful man. You've not heard the last of him in Ireland.</p>
                <p>But Reynolds gave away too much authority, in my opinion, and Dick Spring is very
                    ambitious and wants to become Prime Minister. He has now uprooted the
                    government. He has caused Reynolds to resign — and Bertie O'Hearn has come in as
                    head of the Fianna Fail Party. I'm sure that O'Hearn is going to have to work
                    out another coalition arrangement with Dick Spring. Dick Spring is the dog in
                    the manger, and he's not good for that government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Irish are going through a big hoorah about the problem
                        of abortion. That is, of course, a major issue in the United States. Did one
                        keep as low a profile as one could on this controversy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: The Catholic Church is very strong in Ireland, but losing strength
                    because of this abortion issue, and the divorce situation as well. It's a
                    difficult problem but Reynolds, of course, is anti-abortion and anti-divorce.
                    Dick Spring is not and wants to have open abortion, to have divorce allowed. I
                    don't know what's going to happen but I think there's going to have to be some
                    kind of an accommodation between the two men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about the time you were there. Was this the
                        sort of thing where you, as the ambassador, would just keep out of the line
                        of fire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: We couldn't get involved in the issues of abortion or divorce. That
                    is a no-no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to sit on your staff to keep them from
                        getting involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: That was the word I passed down, and I, being Roman Catholic and a
                    Knight of Malta, was most careful to avoid such discussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the staff of the embassy?</hi>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FITZGERALD: First class. I was very pleased. However, when I arrived in Dublin,
                    all I had was a deputy chief of mission. The political affairs officer had been
                    relieved, and had departed. The administrative officer, the consular officer,
                    and the economics officer all had departed from Dublin. I was shorthanded for
                    about one month but as the relieving officers arrived, one by one, I was able to
                    fill in the holes in the operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I also had a USIA man on the staff. As I understood it, there's
                    always a turnover, about one-third every year, but this time the turnover was
                    about three-quarters of the key officers. It was one of those administrative
                    shortfalls which occur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aberrations that happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How about emigration?</p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Oh, God, that was a sore spot. My predecessors, several before me,
                    had allowed the emigration eligibility law to be interpreted very liberally.
                    There were people traveling to the United States — students and Irish citizens
                    going over on tourist visas — who never came back. We got to the point where
                    people, knowing damn well they weren't coming back, were getting members of the
                    Parliament, of the Dail, to guarantee their return to Ireland. When I arrived in
                    Dublin, there was heavy pressure on our consular people who knew that these
                    Irish citizens were not going to come back to Ireland and were very reluctant to
                    issue visas.</p>
                <p>There was a great brouhaha, with the newspapers and Dail members stating that the
                    minister of foreign affairs is going to straighten this thing out with the
                    ambassador and so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>I promptly arranged to meet with David Andrews, the minister of foreign affairs,
                    and looking over the record, I said, “Do you realize that about 20% of the
                    people who are going to the US on tourist visas or student visas do not return?
                    We are operating under an illegal situation, where your members of the Dail are
                    guaranteeing the return of some of these students and tourists. Where in the
                    world, on emigration, can a third party guarantee a second party, both of them
                    non-American nationals? It doesn't work, and I'm going to stop it right now.
                    There are no longer going to be any guarantees as they are not necessary. Your
                    members of the Dail are jeopardizing their careers, their reputations, by
                    guaranteeing questionable people going to the United States. All we're doing is
                    creating a problem with all kinds of difficulties. No more guarantees. We don't
                    accept a guarantee from anybody. Period.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Inside of about two weeks, after the usual rumblings and grumblings of “My Uncle
                    Pat has to get to America,” and that sort of thing, it stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for you. I speak as an old consular officer, knowing
                        the problems. Did Senator Edward Kennedy loom rather large in whatever you
                        were doing, because of his Irish connection and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: I've known Teddy Kennedy since he was literally in diapers, and I've
                    known the whole family for 55 years and, as a matter of fact, I was one of
                    Kathleen's many admirers when she was in Washington during the war. She was a
                    wonderful girl. And, of course, I've known Joe, Jr., Jack and Bobby and all the
                    girls, but Jean I didn't know at all well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's the present ambassador to Ireland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: She's there now. I knew her husband, Steve Smith, who was in the
                    brokerage business in New York for some years.</p>
                <p>But Teddy has had quite an interest in the IRA and what they were doing, and he's
                    been trying to help.</p>
                <p>I think the classic example just happened last year, with Ethel Kennedy's
                    daughter, Courtney, who married this terrorist, Hill, who was convicted of
                    killing a British policeman. Teddy Kennedy went over to Belfast as senator of
                    the United States; Jean Kennedy went up to Belfast as US ambassador to Ireland;
                    Joe Kennedy went over as congressman from Cambridge, Massachusetts; and I don't
                    know how many other members of the Kennedy family appeared in Belfast as
                    character witnesses for this man Hill. The British government went ballistic on
                    this event, and our embassy in London as well. That, to me, was one of the most
                    outrageous violations of protocol and diplomacy that you could think of. Yet
                    they did it, and they got this man out. He's on probation now, but I am not
                    certain of his status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else that we should cover on this time
                        in Ireland? Any other issue? We've covered quite a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FITZGERALD: Well, I can say that I worked that country from north to south, east
                    to west. Everywhere, I was there, like Kilroy. I enjoyed it tremendously.</p>
                <p>One of the parting shots, I guess for me amusing. I was having luncheon with Dick
                    Spring, who had become the new minister of foreign affairs. And I said, “Dick,
                    you know, I'm one of your constituents. I am a Kerry Man.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>He said, “You are?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>He represented North Kerry.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Good, God, yes. All you have to do is look in the books, Dick. Our
                    family properties covered from Listowel up to the Shannon.” His district. Let's
                    say he had part of that area. Listowel to the Shannon.</p>
                <p>And he said, “Oh, yes, yes, oh, I know...”</p>
                <p>And I said, “However, you know, quite a number of us, quite a number of the
                    FitzGeralds emigrated.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Where did they emigrate to, America?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “No, County Cork.”</p>
                <p>We were friends from there on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mr. Ambassador, I want to thank you very much. This
                        has been both very useful and enjoyable. Thank you.</hi>
