                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 17, 2005</p>
                <p>Copyright 2005 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go on your father's side first. Where did the
                        Malkins come from? And what were they up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: My father's side all came from Georgithe Russian Georgia, not the one in
                    the south of the U.S. And my mother's family was from Lithuania originally. I'm
                    not sure if they came here for economic opportunities or to avoid the czar's
                    army or both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a great incentive - the czar's army was almost a
                        life, wasn't it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was not a pleasant occupation to get drafted into. You didn't know
                    when you were going to get out again. So they both migrated and they met
                    sometime in Philadelphia and I think that's when they were married and started
                    producing many children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Commercial laundry. Oh, my father or my grandfather?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start with your grandfather.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: My grandfather I think was in the commercial laundry business in
                    Philadelphia and he did well at that. And my grandmother would have been a
                    housewife.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: My father was always with the Philadelphia Board of Education. He was a
                    teacher, a vice-principal, and finally a principal. Then he headed up, in the
                    end, the night school system in Philadelphia for adults.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now where did he go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Temple University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your mother's side, where did they come from,
                        Lithuania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, Lithuania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you know about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Nothing I can remember at the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on your mother's siddo you know her mother and
                        father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: No, I never met any of my grandparents except my mother's mother who died
                    when I was seven. I really never had a chance to have any relationship and ask
                    about them. My family has not been strong in the tradition of passing down the
                    lore of ancestry either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up in Philadelphia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, I spent my first 21 years in Philadelphia. I went to the public
                    magnet school, Central High School, and then the University of Pennsylvania for
                    my BA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family live when you were a kid, growing up
                        in Philadelphia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Until I was four, we lived in an apartment near 15th and Spring Garden
                    streets in a terrible place. We then moved to Comly Street in the northeasoff
                    Frankfort Avenue. Then, when I was nine, we moved to West Oak Lane, which is in
                    the northwest area close to the Cheltenham Township border but still within city
                    limitnear Temple University's football stadium.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Fabulous. It was great being a kid. I enjoyed my home and my friends and
                    school and all the activities. I had a very blessed childhood. My mother was
                    home with me, an only child, and took good care of me. It's amazing that, being
                    an only child, I wasn't spoiled at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was family life like? I mean, let's talk about at
                        home sitting around the dinner table, or the day's activities, that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, sometimes my father talked about his work and teaching experience.
                    My mother who was at home talked about what we did during the day and what my
                    schedule was and what she did in the way of household activities.</p>
                <p>My father, when teachers used to be paid only for working nine months of the
                    year, had a summer job, selling ice cream from a truck. We used to talk about
                    some of the people he met and that's when I started collecting coins, when he
                    had his ice cream truck. He came home with bags of coins and my job was to help
                    him sort them and put them in envelopes and take them to the bank. I started
                    collecting those coins too, putting them in my coin books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family fall religiously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: My parents were Conservative Jews and I'm Reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How conservative were they? Was Judaism a major element in
                        your early life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: We were in a Jewish neighborhood in the northwest, and every Jewish boy
                    was going to Hebrew class twice a week and preparing for bar mitzvah. After bar
                    mitzvah I didn't follow through. I only got interested again, really, when I my
                    children were old enough to go to Hebrew school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got religion again </hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I guess the religion came back as a tradition in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family fall politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MALKIN: They were pretty liberal Democrats. That would be the general description
                    of them. For the poor people, in favor of safety nets and education, very
                    strongly education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I believe I was, but don't ask me to name books that I read then that
                    weren't assigned by the school. I can't remember even the ones that were
                    assigned by the school, let alone the extra work I did. But I did read and
                    absorbed a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your neighborhood likfrom a kid's
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was a middle class neighborhood. All the husbands were working and
                    many of the wives were not; they were homemakers. They had a wide variety of
                    jobs. Somebody was in real estate, my father was in teaching, and others were in
                    business. My friend's father was also a teacher, then principal of a school.
                    Someone else worked for the gas company. There was quite a diversity.</p>
                <p>We had a single home, but a lot of the neighborhood was row houses. Most people
                    lived in row houses. We had a three-bedroom, one-bath single home that was very
                    comfortable. It had a nice little lawn in the back and front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, I loved school. I did well at it. I was encouraged constantly to do
                    well at school and I found that it came to me fairly easily. I didn't have to
                    work too hard to understand things and it was a good experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you moved through the system up to high school, did you
                        find that any particular courses appealed to you and others didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, in high school I enjoyed doing math problems and got quite good at
                    them. I wasn't big on art, I never did learn an instrument properly and I wasn't
                    very athletic. But the things that had to do with mathematics were good for
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Central High School. It's in central Philadelphia.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: This was an all boys' high school and it's also a magnet school, you call
                    it now. It was the only one in the city that drew boys from all geographic areas
                    and other high schools due to academic excellence in their junior high school
                    years. Central High School also attracted the elite of the teacher body of the
                    Philadelphia Education System, because they were anxious to have better students
                    to teach. I was in the advanced class within Central High School and made some
                    friends amongst very interesting characters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about this period, moving from '46 into the early
                        '60s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: High school would have been from '59 to '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Kennedy candidacy make any particular dent in your
                        interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, in '63 I was 17, and I don't recall it making a big difference. Off
                    hand, the only thing I really remember sharply about the election is that he was
                    the first Catholic to be elected President. That seemed to be a big issue in
                    discussions in the press at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about blacks in school? In Philadelphia, there is a
                        large population of African Americans. Were there </hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: There were some at Central, but they were a fairly small minority</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were running with sort of a Jewish
                        crowd at school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, Jews were highly represented at school. In my neighborhood where I
                    grew up, I only had one Italian Catholic friend who I was really close with. In
                    high school, quite a few of the students I knew were Jewish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school, were you pointed towards
                        anything? Did you have any idea where you wanted to go, what you wanted to
                        study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MALKIN: I recall being more an across the board type. I don't recall that my
                    later interest in economics was well developed in my high school years. I had a
                    comparative economics course that piqued my interest. When I left Central, I
                    thought I was going to do advanced college work in mathematics, which turned out
                    not to be the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happeneyou graduated in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: The summer of '63 from Central.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was University of Pennsylvania like in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was a fine university. It had great facilities and well-known
                    teachers. The disadvantage I had for knowing what it was like was that I had to
                    commute the first two years to save money. So I lived at home, and at the end of
                    the class day and library time I went home for dinner and everybody else went
                    back to their dorms and met people and partied and did things socially. So I was
                    at a disadvantage socially there to get around and do things other than just go
                    to class and then go home and do homework. But the Annenburg Library was open
                    then and it was just a wonderful library facility. They had a very good student
                    union building which is still there, remodeled. There is a very strange dorm
                    therthe quathe freshman dorms. They always seem to be short of space for
                    students, and I think until recently that was still the case but now they've
                    been expanding so much that it's almost impossible to recognize the campus. It
                    is so big with all the new buildings that have gone up. But I've always had a
                    good impression of Penn and certainly enjoyed the second two years I was there
                    living on campus and in an apartment with friends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did foreign affairs cross your radar screen at all while
                        you were in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was in my sophomore year that I had a Foreign Service Officer come to
                    speak to my political science class. The career he described at that time just
                    thrilled me because it incorporated all the things I wanted to do. I could use
                    my economics and political science background, I could learn languages, I could
                    travel around the world and work with high quality people, and I would get paid
                    for it as well. So it seemed a terrific combination that I couldn't resist. I
                    became more and more interested in it, and then went through the application
                    process in my junior year. However, in 1967, I informed the State Department
                    that I was going for two years of graduate school (on a National Science
                    Foundation scholarship). The Department said that, as of December 1968, I was
                    eligible to join the next junior officer training class at FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from University of Pennsylvania in '67. Was
                        the draft a problem at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes it was, actually. From '67 until it was over in '75, there was always
                    the chance of being drafted. I was okay while I was at Penn and then I did a
                    year of grad school in London and another year in Geneva, Switzerland. At that
                    point my number came up, and I was due to be called up and drafted. In fact, I
                    had to take my medical for the army at a Frankfurt, Germany army base.</p>
                <p>To go back a little bit, as I said, I took the Foreign Service exam in my junior
                    year at Penn, and I passed it and the other parts of the process, the oral, the
                    medical, and the security check. In my senior year I was told that I was high on
                    the appointment list, and I would be called to join the Foreign Service in 1967.
                    Then I received a scholarship for two years of graduate studies. I had been to
                    London between my sophomore and junior years when I did some traveling in
                    Europe. I loved London, and I wanted to go back there. One of my economics
                    professors at Penn knew a colleague at the London School of Economics and
                    Political Science (LSE), and put in a reference for me. So I went to LSE for a
                    year and did my Master's in International Economics. I was exempted from LSE's
                    first year courses thanks to my courses and grades in my undergraduate studies.
                    I graduated cum laude. At LSE, an economics professor who knew of my keen
                    interest in a career in diplomacy recommended me to the University of Geneva's
                    Graduate Institute of International Studies. The Institute brought educated
                    foreigners to Geneva to mix with the Swiss students. Half the classes were in
                    French, and my French improved immensely while living there for the 1968-1969
                    academic year. Having a French girl as a friend helped the most. The economics
                    taught there was less advanced than that taught at LSE, but the courses on
                    international organizations and diplomatic history were superb.</p>
                <p>So, in the summer of '69 when I finished the academic year in Geneva, I came back
                    to State. I had not yet been drafted when I joined the August '69 Junior Officer
                    Training class. At that time, Foreign Service work was considered by the Army as
                    an acceptable alternative for deferral. I kept that deferred status for my
                    Foreign Service work until I was too old to be drafted at 26.</p>

                        went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: One of the questions I was asked was: If I were stationed in South
                    Africa, how would I describe American race relationblack/white relationto
                    educated South Africans so that they would understand our system and why we're
                    critical of apartheid? In the late 1960's, I found it a very difficult question
                    to answer. I was not very sure of how well my oral exam went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, in wha'70 ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MALKIN: The junior officer class of August '69 consisted of about 22 members.
                    There were three or four women, one of them black. Overall, it was pretty much a
                    middle-class white male group. I remember the JOT class as being a fun
                    experience. Since my economic testing in the Foreign Service application process
                    was very strong because I had majored in economics at Penn, I wanted to be an
                    Economic Officer. I can't say that the academic studies at Penn had prepared me
                    for what I would do as an economic/commercial officer, but it was a useful
                    framework.</p>
                <p>I was first told that I was assigned to our consulate in Khorramshahr, Iran, but
                    was subsequently changed to our embassy in Kingston, Jamaica, where I duly
                    arrived in November of '69 aboard a U.S. cruise ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came in '69. Your first post was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I was very excited. First of all, all the single men were being assigned
                    to the Cords Program in Vietnam. They were going as Village Pacification Liaison
                    Officers or, if they were lucky, assigned to our embassy in Saigon. However, I
                    was the only bachelor who had taken the economics test option and done very
                    well, and I was told that is why I was given the option to go as an
                    Economic/Commercial Officer somewhere other than Vietnam. I was offered a
                    position that had been vacated by a medical evacuation in Khorramshahr, the port
                    city in southern Iran, which I think is mostly an administrative post for
                    bringing in household and other shipments for the embassy. Still, I thought this
                    was fabulous. I was going to Persia. I didn't care what the work was - it just
                    seemed to be the whole beauty of the Foreign Service. I'd be going to a famous
                    country. I bought my Farsi language book and I was anxious to get started with
                    the language, I was doing area studies. And then I'm told that State received
                    word from the Ambassador in Tehran that there had been an internal juggling of
                    positions. Someone from the Embassy went to Khorramshahr to fill the job, and
                    the embassy did not require anyone going to the position in Tehran to fill it
                    when that transfer was made. Basically there were no more openings in Iran.</p>
                <p>So, after a little bit of internal discussions, I was told by FSI that the only
                    other available post at this time, because everything other than Cords in
                    Vietnam had been assigned, was an opening for an economic/commercial officer in
                    Kingston, Jamaica. Actually, it was a junior officer rotational position,
                    eventually rotating into economic and commercial work. This was very
                    disappointing as it was so close to the U.S., and I was really down for a while
                    because it didn't seem to be in the mainstream of foreign policy. But I came
                    around to thinking of it as a good assignment when I considered the
                    alternatives.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>At that time you were allowed to take U.S. ship lines, so I went on the U.S.S.
                    Roosevelt, which stopped at Aruba, Curacao, and Caracas before reaching
                    Kingston. It took ten days to get there, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Then
                    I got to Kingston, and it turned out to be a wonderful place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Kingston from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: November '69 to February '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was so wonderful about Kingston?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: The people were great, the climate was beautiful, the beaches white sand,
                    and the water blue. Being brand new, I liked everything I was doing. Even the
                    visa work was different. I made good friends there. I was married there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I've heard about Kingstoa real problem of
                        lawlessness and all that. Had that developed at all while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I think that was very minor when I was there. It was when Michael Manley
                    became prime minister, just after I left in '72, that Kingston and all of
                    Jamaica took a political and economic nose-dive. Manley decided to get close to
                    Castro, and his politics went way left and anti-American and anti-white. But
                    when I was there it was under PM Shearer and his finance minister, Seaga. I
                    tried to write a doctoral thesis there for Geneva on how Jamaica could be the
                    Switzerland of the Caribbean. The Institute wanted me to come there for further
                    work on my first draft, which I could not do at this point in time, so it was
                    never approved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when Manley came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, he was a disaster. Although he was the son of the George Washington
                    of Jamaica, his politics were really left wing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MALKIN: The first six months I was in the admin section working with the GSO and
                    Admin Officer in a wide variety of tasks designed to keep the embassy
                    functioning smoothly. Then it was the visa section, immigrant and non-immigrant,
                    which was also active because there was such a demand for visas. Occasionally I
                    see my old supervisor, Bill Moody, who is retired and now lives in Reston.</p>
                <p>Finally, for the second year I was rotated into the Economic/Commercial Section,
                    where there was a junior officer position. There were only an Economic Counselor
                    and a Political Counselor, but there was no political support job. So I got the
                    available commercial job and started meeting the business community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: When I went down it was a political appointee named Vincent De
                    Roulet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a problem, wasn't he, as I recall </hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: He was there the whole two years that I was. He created problems until he
                    was PNG'd (made persona non grata) by PM Michael Manley. During his 1972 open
                    congressional testimony in Washington, De Roulet said that he had met with
                    Manley privately and told him, “The U.S. doesn't want you as Prime Minister. I'm
                    going to work against you.” Manley took that personally, and told De Roulet when
                    he was in Washington to not come back.</p>
                <p>The ambassador was very wealthy. He had a yacht with a five-person full time
                    crew. He had race horses which he boarded at a stable in Jamaica and the Admin
                    Officer was basically in charge of the race horses and the GSO (General Services
                    Officer) was taking care of the yacht. Any time left over would go to the DCM
                    (Deputy Chief of Mission).So there was a lot of pressure on Admin from the top.
                    And De Roulet was very quixotic and erratic. He once came to my office when I
                    was interviewing immigrant visa applicants, and told me not to give anybody a
                    visa. He stayed there for a half-hour or so, and I had to turn down everybody
                    before me. If I thought they were good applicants, I told them to come back with
                    some more documentation in a day or two and I'd look at it. But I believe that
                    if I had actually granted a visa to anybody in front of him after he had told me
                    not to do it, he would have had me sent away to someplace else on my first
                    tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Jamaican society, was it pretty open, did you
                        meet many Jamaicans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, I did. The Political Officer, Kenneth Rogers, was very nice and he
                    invited me to his receptions. He was very well connected, so I met a number of
                    Jamaica's business and political leaders. At the end of '70, at the Political
                    Counselor's Christmas reception, I met a woman whose parents had a record
                    distribution and music studio company in Kingston and were doing very well as
                    the sole licensee for many Motown labels. They distributed throughout the
                    Caribbean Islands. I met her on her holiday vacation. She was back from Canada
                    where she'd just graduated from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. She was
                    planning to work for her parents until it got warmer and then go back to Canada
                    to live again. The short story is that we got married in September o'71. So I
                    left Jamaica in February '72 with a new bride.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the economic-commercial situation while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was doing very well. The isle was definitely prospering. The business
                    community was mostly Lebanese- and Chinese- and Jewish Jamaican. They owned the
                    bigger businesses, such as the brewery and the dairy, and were the biggest
                    employers. The dairy owner was my next-door-neighbor where I was living. It
                    seemed the economy was doing pretty well. It was not a rich country, but it has
                    good climate and the food was cheap, unless you bought imported food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any of the tensions of the more black
                        Jamaicans, the underclass? Did they live in areas where it wasn't a good
                        idea to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, there were areas in west Kingston, or Spanish Town, which was a
                    small city not too far from Kingston that were considered dangerous by other
                    Jamaicans, especially before elections. I remember driving into a poor black
                    neighborhood because I wanted a piece of this famous Jamaican carver's work. I
                    drove to his place several times and nobody ever bothered me. There was still a
                    certain respect for foreigners and white or light-skinned people. If you met
                    somebody who was high on ganja, then he might give you a hard time. The one time
                    I remember meeting a Rastafarian smoking ganja, he offered me some. When I told
                    him I don't smoke, he said, “That's baad mon, that's baad.”</p>

                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I don't recall a big British overseas resident community in Jamaica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe what I'm thinking of was more in Bermuda and

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Sugar plantations and rum mills were big in Jamaica, but except for the
                    banks, I don't remember a large British business community,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there in '72, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I had to come back to Washington, of course. I'd married a foreigner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was Canadian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: She was born in British Guyana, and she had Jamaican citizenship as well
                    as Guyanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I started going to work, and my wife tried to orient herself and find
                    work because we didn't have kids yet. She was not thrilled with the fact that
                    she was so isolated out in the suburbs. Over the years, having an educated wife
                    with not enough to do to keep her happy and busy, feeling like she's
                    accomplishing something herself, became an increasing problem. She tried to
                    learn to type and do office work, but she really didn't settle into anything for
                    the two years we were in Washington. It was a lot different than being the
                    saleswoman for her father's company, traveling among the Caribbean islands. As I
                    recall, she got her immigrant visa quickly because she was married to an
                    American. She also got her U.S. citizenship after two years in the States, since
                    she did not have to be resident five years if you were being sent overseas with
                    the Foreign Service. I went to work at the Commerce Department's Trade Promotion
                    Office, having done good work on our commercial programs in Jamaica. It was an
                    orientation year to learn about and recruit for trade missions and catalog
                    shows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Department of Commerce in those days,
                        because there has been a sort of long-standing clash between the State
                        Department and the Department of Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: The Foreign Commercial Service wasn't formed until 1980, and I was
                    working for State, but Commerce had a big say in Commercial Officers
                    assignments. The building was very big and cavernous, with long, wide, and dingy
                    hallways. In my particular area of trade promotion, I found the people were
                    quite dedicated and industrious and trying to do their jobs conscientiously. But
                    it's not too stimulating there, and a lot of the jobs were a lot less
                    interesting than what I was involved with.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the sort of reputation it had - and one reason why
                        probably the State Department didn't do very well in trade promotion. How
                        were you welcomed there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I don't recall anything but nice treatment from my colleagues at the
                    Commerce Department the year I was there, In fact, some of the friendships I
                    made were helpful in the future in other assignments. Since I'd now spent a year
                    with them I was under their wing. They looked after me more than the personnel
                    system at State ever would have. I had no angel working for me, I had no high
                    contacts, and, at that time if not now, you had to have a friend in Personnel to
                    get a decent assignment. Having Commerce on my side in the assignment process
                    was a plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after a year there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I went to INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doing What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Economic analysis and research and reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In any particular area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I know my section was working on Japan a lot, and one of the CS there was
                    an expert on Japan. I was trying to introduce some of the early computer uses. I
                    was interested in computer programs at the time, and I got the LOTUS 123, I
                    think it was called, which was one of the early forecasting spreadsheet
                    programs. We tried to use that to take data and forecast. I felt that most INR
                    work projects were heavily focused on providing current intelligence for
                    Secretary of State William Rogers, who came back from his meetings at the White
                    House and told his staff what President Nixon and NSA Kissinger wanted to
                    support their positions. INR was expected to produce papers to support those
                    positions. My impression was that independent and longer term reporting was a
                    waste of time. Dissenting research papers would not be welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have not been terribly inspired then, in INR at
                        that timyou didn't feel you were on the cutting edge of where we were
                        going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I think that's a true statement. INR wasn't as respected as it became
                    later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, you were dealing with Japan, and this was just
                        the beginning of the concern about Japan as a competitor, which was at that
                        time in textiles. Did that come up, looking at Japan as a trade
                        competitor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: More as an economic competitor overall. Its economic growth was higher
                    than ours, and its trade was a much larger part of its GNP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I continued at INR until early '74 when I began language training for my
                    next assignment in Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in '74 you went to Mexico and were there from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I was in the Consulate General in Guadalajara for three years, until mid
                    '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: In Guadalajara I had a wider role than I would have had in Mexico City,
                    where officers were just following the petroleum industry or some limited sector
                    of the economy. I was basically doing everything that wasn't consular or admin.
                    I handled mostly trade promotions and U.S. investments. We had maquiladoras
                    there, where American investors were assembling electronic items for re-export
                    back to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A free trade area or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, it's a value added manufacturing free trade area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Consul General there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Matt Ortwein. It was his final posting. It was considered to be a very
                    easy choice post for an end-of-career CG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Guadalajara when you were there?
                        Since you were dealing economic and political and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, I was responsible for our contacts with and reporting on economic,
                    political, and commercial activities. Therefore, I was involved with U.S. and
                    Mexican businessmen, provincial Governors, Chambers of Commerce, student leaders
                    as well as agricultural leaders. USDA's newsletter printed my article on the
                    tequila industry of western Mexico, which required a lot of intensive research
                    on my part, visiting many tequila factories. Our jurisdiction covered six
                    western Mexican states, including Jalisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go out and look, what is it cacti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It is distilled from the fermented juice from the agave plant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a very large American community there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: There is in Lake Chapala, not so much in Guadalajara. There was a big
                    community of veterans and elderly or sick Americans who needed affordable
                    live-in help; there were a lot of deaths of American citizens being processed at
                    the Consulate General because they were just dying from old age or
                    sicknesses</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: As I recall, Luis Echevarr�a �lvarez, was the president, and he was a
                    jerk. I think he is on trial earlier this year for some things he did in those
                    days. He was pretty left-wing, and not pro-American. Then there were the
                    political parties supported by different gangs, while the public universities
                    and the private universities in Mexico City were having student warfare, which
                    spilled over into Guadalajara in a smaller fashion. I tried to keep in touch
                    with student leaders there, and write political reports on what was happening
                    and get them to the Embassy. The Embassy always liked to get these items from
                    the consulates.</p>
                <p>Q: Were these university gangs politically oriented, or were they just gangs?
                    MALKIN: I think they were just gangs. They may have had some nominal connections
                    with the political parties in Mexico. I remember my wife at that time still
                    loved me, and she bought me a bulletproof vest to wear when I went to lunch with
                    these characters. It was different to go to a restaurant with them. They cleared
                    out the floor of the restaurant, and they had bodyguards. It was a little
                    intimidating to be around real thugs. We were a little nervous because this was
                    only a year after the American Economic/Commercial Officer at our Consulate
                    north of us in Hermosillo was kidnapped and killed, and Terence Leonhardy, the
                    former Consul General in Guadalajara had been kidnapped and released. So the
                    whole idea of attacks on Americans in that particular region of Mexico was
                    certainly a real threat that you lived with. It made us aware that American
                    diplomats could be at risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, many of us had accepted the fact the PRI was
                        going to be there forever and ever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I never thought they would be displaced, by the PAN or anybody else, but
                    eventually they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much problem with Americans? Were they
                        getting into trouble, arrested, kidnapped, robbed, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: In Mexico City they were, but not in Guadalajara. In Guadalajara my
                    biggest problem was a crooked American businessman who had one of these
                    maquiladoras, and he brought in these shipments of electronic components and did
                    not pay for them. When I went to his factory to try to mediate a dispute with
                    the Mexican suppliers, the factory was empty. It was padlocked and he was gone.
                    That was unusual.</p>
                <p>I started a little group among the American business community in Guadalajara to
                    meet with the Consul General periodically, since there was no American Chamber
                    of Commerce. We just had informal discussions at the Consulate itself, or maybe
                    at CG Ortwein's home once or twice, to try to plum their thoughts on the likely
                    depreciation of the peso vis-�-vis the dollar and the problem with all the
                    peso-denominated bills that the Americans were investing in because it was going
                    up so fast. What was going to happen if the peso really took a dive, which is
                    exactly what happened in the late 70's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the hand of our Embassy in Mexico City very
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: As I recall, the only ones interested in me were the people at the
                    Regional Trade Center in Mexico City. The Commerce Department had a Regional
                    Trade Center for Central America and Mexico, but it always had its trade
                    promotions in Mexico City. I became friendly with the Mexican organizers of the
                    large annual fair in Guadalajara. In 1977, my third year there, I convinced the
                    men in charge of the fair to donate adequate space in the fairgrounds for an
                    exhibition of American farm machinery. The actual organization of the American
                    businesses was handled by the Commerce's Trade Center in the capital. It was the
                    first time Commerce ever had an off-site exhibition outside Mexico City,
                    although the Trade Center was supposed to be regional. I was flying to Mexico
                    City to coordinate with the Trade Center Director, Art Leonard, and he and his
                    staff came to Guadalajara to check on arrangements. We had a really big
                    exhibition with tractors from John Deere and Caterpillar and a number of other
                    agricultural machinery companies, and it was a big success. So everybody, both
                    State and Commerce, were happy again with my commercial work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, you left there in what, '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: '77. We served in Guadalajara from 1974 -1977. I should mention that our
                    first daughter was born in April of '74, shortly before we moved to Mexico. Our
                    daughter spent her first three years in Guadalajara, and, of course, became
                    bilingual. Years later, she studied Spanish again and regained her fluency.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>My next assignment was to Embassy Singapore, which I received basically because
                    the Commerce Department pushed me very hard in the assignment process to go to
                    Singapore to do commercial work. During home leave that summer, we had our
                    second daughter. We had the two girls, one of them was an infant and the other
                    was three years old. I remember we flew on Pan Am 001 via Frankfurt, Tel Aviv
                    (we stayed in Jerusalem for a few days), Tehran, and New Delhi. Finally we
                    arrived in Singapore. So we had a very interesting trip halfway around the world
                    with an infant and a three-year-old, which put another nail in our marriage
                    coffin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Singapore from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: From the summer of '77 to the summer of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like? Lee Kwan Yew was running everything I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, he definitely chaired the Benevolent Mandarin Program of Singapore,
                    Inc. Politically, it was very well organized. Unfortunately, it depended on
                    suppressing political criticism, press freedom, and an independent judiciary on
                    political matters. Of course, the embassy was always concerned about the lack of
                    a viable opposition party, treatment of opposition party leaders, a press and a
                    judiciary that were not independent, but its efforts to change the system were
                    unsuccessful. On economic and commercial policies, however, it was quite open.
                    It was really a delight to be able to talk to business people in Singapore, and
                    when they told you they would do something, they did it. Their word was good,
                    which made working with them a pleasure. They were pro-American and anxious for
                    higher technology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: We had three ambassadors in Singapore during the four years I was there,
                    including the infamous Richard Kneip, who had eight boys and was the ex-governor
                    of South Dakota. He was not a diplomat or in tune with local politics, and it
                    drove the DCM crazy. On the other hand, we also had the privilege of serving
                    under two outstanding career ambassadors, John Holdridge and Harry Thayer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main sort of interests that you were doing
                        on the economic/commercial side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MALKIN: I was promoting American exports and investments through Commerce
                    Department programs I had learned during my earlier assignment in Washington.
                    Again I worked closely with Commerce's Regional Trade Center in Singapore. I was
                    trying to give American businesspeople information that would bring them to
                    Singapore to do regional sales and manufacturing activities. I helped them find
                    good local agents and distributors. Commerce was pretty good about putting
                    together trade missions of small to medium sized businesses that normally would
                    not go to places like Singapore unless they were brought in a group and
                    hand-held. I would get them appointment schedules and arrange government
                    meetings, which is the way I once was able to sit in on a meeting at the Istana
                    Palace and meet PM Lee Kwan Yew. He liked American investors so much that he
                    hosted them for a meeting in his offices there. I was on a first name basis with
                    the Minister of Trade, Goh Chok Tong, who later became Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>I researched and authored a lengthy airgram (remember those?) called “How to Do
                    Business in Southeast Asia”. Based on almost 50 interviews, I pointed out all
                    the difficulties we had competing with the Japanese in Singapore and other
                    Southeast Asian markets. It was reprinted by the Department of Commerce and used
                    as a model for Commercial Officers to use and also as a handout for potential
                    investors</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)?
                        Was that getting going while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was just getting going. It had economic and commercial objectives, but
                    functioned more as a political forum at the time. Later, it had a free trade
                    area and other activities, but it was not very effective while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeinwas Japan our big competitor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Oh, yes. Definitely Japan. Japanese businessmen were willing to spend the
                    time and money and had the patience to develop long-term connections with the
                    agents, distributors and manufacturers there. More so than even the big American
                    companies, which sent high level people once a year to visit. That just was not
                    a sufficient effort to establish close links in the Singapore business
                    community. There were about 40 American banks represented on the island, but
                    many of them were doing very little business other than showing their flag to
                    their competitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw this back in the '50s when I was in the Persian Gulf
                        Commercial Office. People just wouldn't spend the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, you had to be there for the weddings and the birthdays and the
                    dinners out with the guys and build up some rapport before they would feel
                    comfortable doing big business with you. It's just the way the Chinese did
                    business there. And Singapore's population was 85% Chinese, with the business
                    sector even more highly run by Chinese Singaporeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself running across any Chinese business
                        customs that were hard for Americans to understand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, if that's a euphemism for bribery...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only for bribery, but for other things. For example,
                        going to weddings, going to funerals and you know show yourself, or just the
                        way deals are made, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Basically, it comes down to the fact that, yes, in Southeast Asia,
                    especially with the largely Chinese contingent there in business, you really had
                    to take your time and not be in a rush to set deadlines, goals, and objectives
                    that were part of your corporate short-term strategy plan, but couldn't be
                    achieved by the Singaporean in that time frame. Take the long view; be willing
                    to invest and not make money for a while. In fact, the Japanese were giving away
                    stuff just to get a toehold. They did loss leaders for a year or two or more if
                    they had to. Then afterward they had a monopoly after every one else was driven
                    out of the market. They recouped losses. They had other advantages we do not
                    have, like the Zaibatsu, or multi-sector corporation. Their banks in the same
                    corporate group would finance their deals; their ships would ship it; their
                    suppliers would get the spare parts. That way they could lose on the initial
                    sale and make it up on the spare parts, the shipping and the financing. They did
                    not lose money in the end; maybe the direct seller did not make money but
                    somebody in the group did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did American investors invest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, there was a large business community because it is a regional hub
                    and compared to Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta or Manila, it was safe, it was clean,
                    communications were good and improving all the time, there were plenty of air
                    connections for the region. Lots of things go through Singapore to get to other
                    countries. The health conditions were excellent, the housing was excellent, the
                    tennis was excellent, the swimming pools were excellent. You could get domestic
                    help if you needed it. It was a very comfortable family-type place to live. As
                    Commercial Officer, with all the new American companies coming in and the
                    visitors to the existing ones, I was invited and going to two receptions an
                    evening, four or five nights a week during the first year. I cut back after
                    that. It was not good for familial relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That reminds me, I talked to somebody that was there, I
                        think an Economic Counselor in Beijing in the '90s and he talked about what
                        he referred to as “death by duck”. And this was they would have these
                        delegations coming through almost on a daily basis and they would all have
                        to go to a Peking duck restaurant, you know, which is fun for the first
                        time, but the third time in a week it gets a little bit long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you have any regional responsibilities there?</p>
                <p>MALKIN: In practice, no, because we had Economic Commercial Officers in all the
                    other capitals, and they were not delegating any power to Embassy Singapore. But
                    much of what I wrote, I wrote in a way that was applicable to more than the
                    Singapore market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Department of Commerce? Were they
                        supportive of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, they were. Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service was formed in 1980,
                    as you know, as a response to strong complaints by the American business
                    community that State Department officers were not doing enough to help them get
                    business overseas. Even though I opted to stay as an Economic Officer with
                    State, I was put on the Country Team for the remainder of my assignment so I
                    could attend meetings with my Economic Counselor boss. I also closely
                    coordinated my work with Commerce's Regional Trade Center in Singapore. They
                    were very helpful and backed me up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was China getting to be a major rival?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: China was not a rival competitor with American firms in Southeast Asian
                    markets then. American (and Southeast Asian) companies were excited about
                    selling to China more than buying from it. Singapore was touting itself as a
                    rival of Hong Kong. Most of the Americans would go through Hong Kong as a
                    gateway to the rest of China, for reasons that are pretty apparent. It is well
                    placed and well organized for that business. Singapore always seemed to be in
                    rivalry with Hong Kong for the Chinese markets, and it was trying to attract
                    more business, but it is not in proximity with Beijing and northern China.
                    Singapore did have excellent financial and legal services. It was trying to
                    convince Americans and other westerners that its companies could do the
                    necessary paperwork better, cheaper, and faster in Singapore than Hong Kong
                    could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you treat the bribery situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MALKIN: It's a law. I mean, we had a law on the books that American companies
                    could not engage in bribery to do business. It is still ion effect, and rightly
                    so. The only time we discussed it was when we found out that the French had a
                    law subsidizing bribery payments as a business expense. Of course, the Japanese
                    would do anything; it didn't matter, what ever it took to get the businessman on
                    their side. They didn't have any qualms about using gifts and money as
                    incentives to do business. However, I believe that bribery of Singapore
                    government officials was quite rare, as they were carefully scrutinized and
                    relatively well paid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, was Vietnam at all a commercial
                        entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Not really. This was '77 to '81 and, of course, they were just recovering
                    from war and rebuilding their political and economic structures. I don't think
                    it became much of an attraction to Americans until after we had an embassy
                    established there some 8 or 10 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Indonesia? Were business people using Singapore
                        as the center, but doing a lot of business in Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: The big business in Indonesia was oil and gas. The only big American
                    companies were in the oil and gas fields in northern Sumatra, just about where
                    the (2005) tsunami hit up there. Although partnering with an experienced
                    Singaporean company was an excellent arrangement, if you really wanted to do
                    business in Indonesia, you needed somebody pretty good in Jakarta, too. You
                    can't do business in Indonesia from afar. There are too many people to take care
                    of, too many middlemen and high level people. It was not an easy place to do
                    business; it never was, still isn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '81 you left there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MALKIN: We went back to the Department (of State). My first job in the Department
                    when we got back in '81 was working in the Economic Bureau in the GSP
                    (Generalized System of Preferences) Program, where we were using trade not aid
                    as an incentive to developing countries to make economic progress. Instead of
                    aid programs, we would give them trade preferences through lower tariffs for
                    their goods being exported to the U.S. than we gave to developed countries. The
                    only problem was of course that the developing countries' competitors are not
                    France and Germany, but their neighbors, other developing countries.</p>
                <p>The GSP program was well intentioned, and it did bring in a certain amount of new
                    trade, but I do not recall seeing any statistics that it was an overwhelmingly
                    successful program. It was very time consuming. You needed somebody full time
                    because USTR's (U.S. Trade Representative) Jon Rosenbaum was running it. They
                    were chairing the subcommittee for GSP product reviews, and held frequent
                    meetings to go over new applications, complaints, and the trade figures for the
                    previous year, which largely determined which goods from which countries were
                    eligible for duty free treatment and which ones were not. It was really a very
                    labor intensive process. I got good at it, and luckily I got some trips out of
                    it. I went overseas to do trade seminars on how to benefit from GSP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were we doing most of this? Was it Africa? I mean
                        where did we have GSP agreements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was a lot of countriedozens, all throughout the developing world. I'm
                    trying to think which ones took the most advantage of it. I think probably the
                    Central and South Americans. A lot of it was agricultural - there were a lot of
                    agricultural preferences given.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay in this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Until 1983, when my marriage went down the tubes with my first wife. We
                    were divorced in '86. From mid-1983, I was with the U.S. Mission to the
                    Organization of American States (USOAS), which is located on the 6th floor of
                    the old part of the Department. We have a small but interesting diplomatic
                    mission, with an ambassador and DCM. I was the Economic/Commercial Officer for
                    three years, which I found fascinating, and I enjoyed it a lot. I was able to
                    use my Spanish again, and regained my fluency in it. When I arrived, the
                    ambassador was William Middendorf, an experienced professional and a good man to
                    work for. Our delegation to the OAS annual meeting in Brasilia in late 1983 won
                    a Meritorious Group Award. Unfortunately, he was succeeded by Richard McCormick,
                    a political appointment, who seemed to have little interest in the main issues
                    before us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main things that you were concerned

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Trade restrictions. All the countries were complaining to USTR about
                    trade restrictions. Jon Rosenbaum of USTR was a very hard-nosed negotiator who
                    would join me for annual meetings with the OAS countries. That was one exciting
                    area. The OAS country diplomats were always looking for either bigger quotas or
                    lower tariffs or some special preference from the U.S., often on agricultural
                    and mining exports. I helped them with their questions on GSP in order to get
                    them to look at that as a program their countries could use.</p>
                <p>We were almost always isolated in opposition to the other Latin American OAS
                    members on the bigger, more important issues. Peru led the opposition, with
                    support from Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia. Sometimes we were
                    supported by the Caribbean Island states. The Canadians were off on the side
                    observing all of this to try to figure out why they should become members, which
                    they eventually did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In OAS, did you see that the United States was seen as a
                        big giver and everybody else was trying to get something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: We were perceived more as a big withholder, for not opening our markets
                    more widely to their exportable products. They wanted us to lower our tariff and
                    non-tariff restrictions, such as USDA inspections. They were fighting about
                    copper and sugar and other issues that they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a role did the Mexicans play at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>They were pretty quiet, but supported the lead countries in their votes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brazil had its own barriers, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: That did not matter to them. They justified their protectionism based on
                    their being a developing country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we weren't supposed to have any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: As a rich developed country, we were seen as being unwilling to share our
                    wealth. They felt that we were holding them back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the OAS mission fit within the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MALKIN: It was like being in a little embassy that just happened to be housed in
                    the Department of State building. It could have been housed at an off-site
                    place, too. I may have had some contact with my GSP friends, and coordinated
                    often on ARA issues with country desk officers on OAS work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't you want to go into the Commercial
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I thought at the time, after looking at the two choices, that Commerce's
                    FCS career future was more limited than State's. There would not be much job
                    variety, and I would have some assignments in Washington in the Commerce
                    Department. I decided that my chances for advancement and career improvement
                    were better at State, which was really where I wanted to be with opportunities
                    to do things other then commercial promotion. There were no special incentives;
                    nobody offered me a promotion for staying with State. I just made that choice
                    and I finished out my assignment in Singapore working for the Foreign Commercial
                    Service, and then I came back to State and became a GSP expert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Washington tour ended at that point with the OAS? Or
                        did you have another assignment in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: That's when I went to the Regional Economic Policy Office in the EAP
                    Bureau (EAP/EP). It had an opening, so personnel told me to go talk to them.
                    Since I was immediately available and had a good interview with Bob Duncan, the
                    Office Director, I got the assignment. So from 1986 to 1988, I was in the
                    EAP/EP, doing research and reports on economic issues in the region. In 1988
                    Donald Westmore chose me to join his Regional Affairs Office (EAP/RA), where I
                    was put in charge of the United Nations relations with the East Asian countries,
                    32 of them, and also human rights, including worker rights throughout the
                    region. That was one of the areas I expanded considerably. The Labor Attach�
                    position had been abolished in '86 during a reduction in force exercise, and
                    there was no one really covering labor issues in East Asia. So I picked up that
                    as part of my portfolio and enjoyed it very much. I traveled to see the labor
                    union and labor-related political leaders throughout East Asia, and also I went
                    to the annual ILO (International Labor Organization) meeting in Geneva to meet
                    them there from 1990 through 1996. I became friendly with the AFL-CIO's Asian
                    affairs office in Washington (then known as AAFLI) as well as some of the
                    region's labor officers in different embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And basically, with different permutations you stayed
                        doing this, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes. In 1988, I transferred from an FS position in EAP/EP to a CS
                    position in EAP/RA, which in 1998 was renamed EAP/RSP for Regional Security and
                    Policy. I stayed in that position until I retired in 2002. Also in 1988, I
                    remarried, this time to a Foreign Service Information Officer with USIA named
                    Joanne Rinehart, and we live happily ever after.</p>
                <p>I must mention the major changes in my work that occurred in 1998 after I earned
                    my second Master's degree in National Resource Management Strategy from the
                    National Defense University's Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF).
                    When I returned to EAP/RSP, I found that the Office, under Pamela Slutz, had
                    undergone a large transformation in my one-year absence. It now was responsible
                    for all the “global issues” in the region, adding the environment, drug
                    trafficking, refugees, and other smaller issues to my existing portfolio. To
                    alleviate the new workload, I was assigned an FSO to be my assistant. From 1998
                    to 2002, I was the Global Issues Adviser in the East Asian and Pacific Bureau,
                    responsible for coordinating policy for many problem issues, including human
                    trafficking, in the 32 country region. Human trafficking, especially of women
                    and children, became a high priority under Secretary Albright. In this newly
                    expanded role, I chaired the State/USAID selection committees of two grant funds
                    of about $3 million each annually. One focused on improving the environment,
                    especially in Southeast Asia. The other was specifically mandated to improve
                    women's rights. I was responsible for final recommendations to the EAP A/S for
                    grants to Asian non-governmental organizations involved in fighting trafficking
                    in persons in the East Asia region. In that role, I led the EAP team that
                    organized the first regional meeting of 21 EAP countries to discuss the
                    trafficking of women and children. It was called the Asian Regional Initiative
                    Against Trafficking, and was held in Manila in the summer of 1999. As a concrete
                    result, I was able to get Bureau funding for the creation of an EAP regional
                    website, www.humantrafficking.org, maintained to this day by the Academy for
                    Educational Development. My team won a Meritorious Group Award for implementing
                    a successful conference on a new and important topic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the labor then. Wasn't it about this time
                        that you might say human rights watchers or other watchers were beginning to
                        take a look at labor conditions for firms like Nike and, you know, all these
                        firms that were having their, particularly clothing items, assembled
                        abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, there was a lot of concern being raised about working conditions and
                    the workers' rights in the East Asia Pacific countries manufacturing clothing,
                    apparel, and shoes. This sensitized our regional embassies as well. The main
                    thing was the lack of independent trade unions. Even though there were trade
                    unions, they were government controlled. The governments didn't like independent
                    trade unions in competition with the government unions and possible supporters
                    of opposition political leaders. So we were championing at times the labor
                    reformers who wanted to have a more independent trade union in their country,
                    especially in Indonesia and Korea, which was achieved over time.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the initial response? You know this
                        became a concern with our embassies and all. Was there a certain amount of
                        reluctance to get into the act?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I think it is natural that the embassy's job in friendly countries is
                    seen as maintaining good relations with the host government, and talking about
                    human rights violations is a prickly issue. It is confrontational to tell the
                    government it is doing something wrong, something we do not approve of, and we
                    want them to change their behavior. Our value-driven effort does not set well
                    with some government officials, and, therefore, the embassy officers, from the
                    ambassador on down, are sometimes reluctant to push too hard on this subject
                    because they had other goals to achieve as well. It's a multi-faceted
                    relationship and they sometimes felt that political stability or economic growth
                    or other bilateral interests were just as important as our human rights
                    interest, and they were going to work on other goals and not so much on human
                    rights. Others championed human and worker rights in a very progressive fashion.
                    Two EAP Assistant Secretaries immediately come to mind as outspoken supporters
                    of human and worker rights, namely, Winston Lord and Stanley Roth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this particular clothing and workers rights and alwhere
                        were some of the trouble points in Southeast Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Southeast Asia is a big manufacturing supplier area for the U.S. Worker
                    issues were evident mainly in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. We also looked
                    at worker rights in the Pacific Islands, but these were not major suppliers to
                    the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you got into this, were there any particular countries
                        where you or the office got particularly involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Some of the embassies got very much involved, especially when the
                    Assistant Secretary was very keen on pursuing human rights and worker rights
                    issues. In the 1990's, we had Winston Lord and Stanley Roth as the Assistant
                    Secretaries. Lord put Burma's situation very high on his agenda, and Roth went
                    to Jakarta and asked for and got meetings with imprisoned labor leaders. They
                    were very forward leaning on human and worker rights. I felt that my job was to
                    be the Jiminy Cricket , the conscience of the Bureau, and make sure that they
                    had the information available to them to be able to make informed presentations
                    and keep communications on this subject alive. I was also very active with desk
                    officers on specific country problems, especially if there was a UN or ILO
                    connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with the Bureau? As you
                        mentioned, bilateral relations are complicated. We have all sorts of issues
                        going, and human rights is just one of them. Did you have problems with
                        other parts of the Bureau saying, “Cool it, don't push trade union problems
                        in Indonesia? We've got other things to worry about?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: The Burma Desk and Embassy Rangoon were the most aggressive on human
                    rights. It was a top priority for them in their policy agenda. I joined EAP/RA
                    in August of '88, the same month that the military junta shot down the students
                    and the protestors in front of the embassy. People there were very upset and
                    every Ambassador, or rather the Charge because we had withdrawn our ambassador,
                    was very helpful in trying to promote human rights and peace with the democracy
                    leaders and supporters. I visited there twice, and even met with Aung San Suu
                    Kyi the second time. She is the leader of the opposition and daughter of the
                    founder of modern Burma. In my U.N. portfolio, we kept up with the U.N. General
                    Assembly resolutions against the government of Burma and the same in the U.N.
                    Human Rights Commission in Geneva and in the ILO. I was active in preparing and
                    critiquing draft resolutions in all three institutions. I also briefed our U.S.
                    delegations before they went to these meetings. I was helping them to know that
                    Burma and other countries were not treating their workers properly. EAP also
                    pursued human and worker rights in South Korea and China, despite our important
                    security and economic relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was any progress up to the time
                        you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Not in Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi is still under house arrest and other
                    leaders of her party are in jail. There really has not been any breakthrough in
                    the relations since 1988. It's still a mess in Burma. But it is the only country
                    in the region where the bureau and the desk were willing to implement sanctions
                    of some kind. The rest of the desks and office directors were more reluctant to
                    do sanctions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, with Burma, that was the only real issue we had
                        almost. I guess drugs were the other thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Drugs, that's right. There was drug trafficking. It is part of the golden
                    triangle. There is also human trafficking, mainly to Thailand and China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Thailand? Were there problems with
                        Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MALKIN: One of the things we did with Thailand, was to encourage them to keep
                    their border areas open to Burmese refugees and let U.N. agencies in to look
                    after them and run the camps. They did not want to do that at first. Eventually,
                    they did let the U.N. come in and the camps became safer and more organized. We
                    were also telling the government that we wanted them to give their workers more
                    rights as well, that they did not protect basic worker rights. For example,
                    workers sometimes were not able to assemble, or bargain collectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Vietnam? At some point we recognized them.How is
                        Vietnam fitting into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I think it became more prominent on the agenda after we re-established an
                    embassy there. Until then, Vietnam was not particularly in the forefront of
                    policy issues in the Bureau as were Japan, Korea, and China. Those were the
                    three biggies, especially China and Japan. I think they have ten officers on
                    each of the desks, so there is a tremendous amount of resources devoted to the
                    northern part of East Asia and less to Southeast Asia, which focused heavily on
                    Indonesia. The Vietnam issue became the human and worker rights of Vietnamese
                    who went to Saipan and were being treated as slave labor in apparel
                    sweatshops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Indonesia? Did you have problems there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, of course. Generally, the embassy was frank with General Suharto
                    about the issues, and, of course, eventually, there was a revolution that ousted
                    him. It was not a bloodless coup, but a pretty peaceful revolution. The daughter
                    of the founder of modern Indonesia, General Sukarno's daughter, was elected
                    President. It's been a rough ride to democracy in Indonesia, and it still needs
                    constant tending, but it seems to be taking hold. You really need a generation
                    or more for countries that are used to authoritarian rule to incorporate
                    democratic behavior and the rule of law. They do not grasp the significance in
                    the first few months or years that they have the right to vote, to feel free
                    from governmental oppression, to assemble peacefully, and to print what they
                    want and say what they want. So it takes sometimes the generation that was
                    brought up under authoritarianism to move on, and the younger people begin to
                    feel that they are entitled to these rights. That's when democracy, I think,
                    will really flourish in places like Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about China. Here is a huge market, the 500-pound
                        gorilla in the area, but dealing with human rights. It's a pretty abysmal
                        record, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MALKIN: I would say so. And labor rights must be included there. Again, it is a
                    country with a government federation of unions that was just part of the system,
                    that was not going to be asking for reforms or demanding any new benefits for
                    the workers, except sometimes in safety and health issues. There were and there
                    still are labor activists like Hong Dong Fong who moved to Hong Kong and
                    transmits his radio show from there. The problem, again, with China, is that the
                    main issues are national security and then economic, almost on a par with that.
                    Then everything after that falls a lot lower on the scale of importance,
                    usually, to the policy makers in Washington, and, therefore, to the embassies
                    and its consulates throughout China. For example, China just enacted a law to
                    use force if Taiwan declares its formal independence. So again we are really in
                    a security issue and that requires a lot of focus. It has already surpassed
                    Japan as our major source of imports from any one county. They have this huge
                    trade imbalance with us, which is somewhat of a concern, especially as they
                    undervalue their currency to the dollar, although the exchange rate was recently
                    allowed to float just slightly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about South Korea? South Korea had gone through
                        several governments, but it had sort of settled down into a functioning
                        democracy by then, or was that somewhat later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: It was still evolving, and the trade union movement was at the forefront
                    of making helpful changes and demanding democratic rights. The independent trade
                    unions were being oppressed by the government. The government had its own trade
                    union federation for many years under the generals. Their federation was the one
                    only one that officially represented them in Geneva at the ILO meetings. It took
                    time, but certainly there has been a big sea change in the labor rights of South
                    Korea. It now gets very high marks in human rights protection in general, and
                    worker rights are a part of that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I was working mainly with three institutions, the General Assembly, the
                    Human Rights Commission, and the ILO. So, again, Burma was always on the agenda,
                    a perennial pariah, and a rogue state. My job was to get support for yearly
                    resolutions condemning the atrocities against the democratic opposition in
                    Burma. We had to lobby the East Asians particularly, because they vote in
                    regional blocks in the UN, and usually the non-block countries look to the block
                    countries where the country of concern is located for signals on how to vote.
                    So, we wanted to get the East Asians on the side of the UN passing strong
                    resolutions condemning the junta. That was true in all three institutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Other issues in the UN for East Asia were the Human Rights Commission, where the
                    Chinese were trying to make sure there was no resolution against their human
                    rights activities, their human rights violations. That was the biggest battle in
                    the Human Rights Commission. The top item was China. When I started, Cuba was
                    the top item because very anti-Cuban people made up the delegation. Then later
                    it shifted to China.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Did it actually implement programs in Asia, like UNDP (United Nations
                    Development Program)?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I think the UN was trying to be responsive to U.S. interests. For
                    example, UNDP certainly turned around in Burma where major projects were vetted
                    by at least the five permanent members of the Security Council, including us. We
                    were trying to make it a little more pro-human rights development program. The
                    World Health people and those in public health administration were doing a great
                    job. They were doing wonderful work in Burma, and I think they deserve credit.
                    The UN High Commission for Refugees helped the Burmese refugees a lot once the
                    Thai government permitted them to run the camps. I think it was UNESCO (United
                    Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) that we pulled out of
                    because it was wasting money. Those were the major U.N. agencies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Mostly cables from our posts were my best source of information.
                    Sometimes the U.N. published documents, but they were more on development and

                <p>MALKIN: Yes, I believe there were in the late '80s and early '90s. There were
                    still Vietnamese boat people, but the country desks handled that issue at that
                    time. The Cambodians were stuck in place under the Hang Sen regime, which still
                    rules today. . Once he became first vice president, he maneuvered himself into
                    being first co-president and then president. He has persecuted opposition
                    politicians, and never completely shed his Khmer Rouge roots. Some Cambodians
                    escaped to Thailand as refugees. Cambodia was mostly focused on transition from
                    the communist Khmer Rouge regime to the more democratic hodge-podge they cobbled
                    together after that. Cambodia has yet to fulfill its democratic promise and
                    remains a very poor country today.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: When you get into New York and you talk to any U.N. Assembly officials,
                    the big complaint about the U.S. was when we paid our backlog of dues. We had
                    adopted a new system whereby we paid on our fiscal year schedule, and we were
                    still always about three to six months behind the U.N. cycle of budgeting. They
                    were always complaining about that. The U.N. has often been beat up by various
                    administrations as not being cost efficient or doing what we thought was
                    appropriate actions. Now you see that we have someone who is supposed to be
                    going to push for reforms in New York.</p>

                    when he was head of the International Organizations Bureau. I don't know if he

                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: I had personal as well as professional reasons to do so. Professionally,
                    I was stuck in my grade in the Foreign Service. I had gone from being a fast
                    riser to a stagnant FS-2, and I did not see much opportunity in the future.
                    Also, I was involved in a divorce and custody battle with my ex-wife. Thus, I
                    did not want to be outside of Washington. If I stayed in the Foreign Service, I
                    had to go overseas. There was an approaching limit on how long I could stay in
                    Washington, so I had to get a Civil Service position whether I liked it or not.
                    But it worked out very well. I liked my work, and I was able to get a GS-15
                    after two years in the job, mainly because of my new work on labor issues.</p>

                        the unions have gotten weaker in the Unites States. And of course as the
                        Cold War died down, and labor was a principal tool to use against the
                        communists. But when it went away, it didn't seem to me to have the same
                        clout.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Absolutely correct. That's a great summary of the situation. In the U.S.,
                    labor's political clout, and support from policy makers, drastically lessened.
                    Its clout domestically did not necessarily lessen once the Cold War was over,
                    but the interest in labor union confederations as proxies for the political
                    powers of adversaries was certainly over. It made them focus more on benefits
                    for their members rather than fighting against the communist unions. Today,
                    however, the AFL-CIO's membership is abysmally low, and four major unions are
                    disaffiliating and may form a competitor federation.</p>
                <p>In Asia, unions are doing much better compared to the '80s. They are quite lively
                    and mostly in healthy condition. There are a lot of issues between private and
                    public sector unions in Asian countries. The public sector employees having much
                    comfier jobs with more benefits than private sector workers. When they demand
                    still more benefits, it turns off a lot of people, especially in Thailand. The
                    people thought the public sector unions were too greedy in what they were
                    demanding. Also, the Thai people figure that even if they are working for
                    somebody today, they will be business owners tomorrow. They were not very
                    supportive of the private sector unions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Japan has the third largest democratic union federation in the world,
                    after ours and the British Trade Union Council. The RENGO Federation is big in
                    Japan. It always has been very influential politically. They can support
                    politicians and get them elected, so domestically they are still a powerful
                    force. The AFL-CIO has had excellent relations over many decades with RENGO.
                    They listen to our concerns and we listen to theirs. They met with the AFL-CIO
                    twice a year to go over policy issues and mutual interests.</p>

                <p>MALKIN: I was in the same position 14 years although the responsibilities had
                    grown dramatically in 1998; I didn't succeed in my efforts to join the Senior
                    Executive Service; I had 33 years of service and was eligible for a full
                    annuity. My wife was retiring that summer as well. She retired on July 1.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was she doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: She was a USIA (United States Information Agency) Officer, a Cultural
                    Affairs Officer, and then stayed with USIA all the way through the move to State
                    and then four or five years at State. Her last assignment was in the Office of
                    Civil Rights. She is a little older than I am, so she felt like she'd like to
                    retire and I said, “I'll retire too. I'm not going to get up and commute to work
                    while you're at home. It sounds too unfair to me.”</p>
                <p>We talked about it for a while, and then I did not retire when I was 55 because
                    my older daughter was getting married, and I did not feel I could afford to take
                    a 50% cut in my income if we were putting money into her wedding. So I stayed
                    another year. Also, on the job side, my position had accumulated, for want of
                    interest elsewhere in the bureau, all of the strategic planning and budgeting
                    process. I was basically in charge of the budgeting process for the bureau, and
                    it got to be quite time consuming. The M Bureau kept changing the process so
                    each year was a little different, and it was hard to get quantitative input from
                    the embassies. It was tiresome and inefficient. Resources are spent poorly on
                    managing the budget, so I was doing more of that and less of the other regional
                    issues that I enjoyed so much. All those elements just came together at the
                    time. A good friend of mine outside the Department said he retired early and
                    loved it; he was having a great time. I was thinking it would be nice not to
                    have to get up at 6:00 and commute and come back at 7:00. It might be nice to go
                    on vacation without asking somebody if I can have leave and not have to
                    negotiate my Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays with the other EAP/RSP
                    Officers. I do not have to wear a tie and jacket every day. So I talked myself
                    into retiring, and it has been a great decision. I'm glad I did it when I did
                    it.</p>

                    and working in a handicraft retail shop that benefited African or other
                    developing country artisans. It's Ten Thousand Villages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. My wife goes there quite often. It's a great
                        organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes, it is a great organization. I worked for it for a year. Then I
                    worked for a year for United Community Ministries (UCM) as an intake operator,
                    trying to sort out whether people who called for help with food or small loans
                    for rent and utilities were eligible for help at UCM. I also worked in Fairfax
                    County's Sherwood Hall library as a monitor for its computer lab.</p>
                <p>Last year (2004), I took an 18-session course with Fairfax County Public Schools
                    to learn to teach English as a Second Language (ESL). But it's not called that
                    anymore; it is now called English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). So it
                    is no longer ESL, it is ESOL. I have been working with several organizations on
                    Route 1 or close to where I live. I wanted to give service to the community
                    after all these years. I've gotten so much out of my life, my country, my work,
                    that I wanted to serve the community in different ways. I think the best way now
                    is to help the people who need my assistance in learning English, working with a
                    group that meets in the basement of the Groveton Baptist Church and another
                    place called Progressive Hispano, which is a non-profit organization that has
                    ESOL and citizenship preparation classes. Both are on Rte. 1, close to where I
                    live in Mount Vernon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your impression of particularly Hispanic immigrants
                        here. One of the statements often says, “Hispanics don't really pay much
                        attention to learning English, they stick to themselves and can survive very
                        nicely without learning English”. What's your impression of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Well, of course they are the largest minority in the U.S. They are a huge
                    community in my area of Fairfax County, and they can survive without learning
                    too much English. But the ones who want to expand their opportunities are paying
                    to go to class at night, after they work ten hours a day. They take a break, eat
                    something, and then come to class for an hour and a half or two hours in the
                    evening. If they're not working, they come in the morning. So, the ones who
                    realize that this is an English-speaking country and they need English to get
                    ahead come to class. We are seeing that there is a very keen demand for teachers
                    and for classes that are affordable. These people are not making big bucks. We
                    can't price ourselves out of their resources. I think that the more teachers can
                    teach immigrants to speak English, the whole country will be the better for it.
                    That is why I am happy and proud to do it as a volunteer teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I commend you for it. It's really an important aspect. And
                        also it brings out our foreign experience, that we're able to have a little
                        more rapport than other teachers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MALKIN: Yes. Of course, having worked in Mexico for three years and then with the
                    U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States for two years in Washington,
                    I feel I have a good sensitivity to the issues in the lives of people in Mexico,
                    Central America, and South America. I am not supposed to speak anything but
                    English in class, but my ability to understand and speak Spanish does come in
                    handy when all else fails.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bruce, I want to thank you very much for this. It's been
                        excellent.</hi>
