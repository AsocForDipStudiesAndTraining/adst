                <p>Born of a Swedish mother in 1904 in Omaha, Nebraska but taken when a baby with
                    older brother and sister to Saint Joseph, Missouri, an aristocratic little town
                    in the mid-west where childhood was spent until sent away to an Episcopal

                <p>Bermuda - January 1946 to July 1947</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Bermuda's motto is borrowed from Virgil: “Whither the Fates Lead Us.” The Fates
                    had led me to Bermuda. The manager of the Everest, where I was to stay was at
                    the dock to meet the Furness liner from New York that brought me to Bermuda in
                    mid January, 1946. This modest, English type hotel had been recommended because
                    the people were kind and the food was good. It had a home life atmosphere and
                    was situated in spacious grounds directly across from the beautiful cathedral, a
                    dominating gothic edifice on Church Street. There were not many guests, but the
                    few were very congenial. Gradually I became acquainted.</p>
                <p>The maid called me every afternoon to ask if I would like to have tea with Mr.
                    Porter, an elderly gentleman who had been an instructor for years in Japan and
                    translated Japanese poetry. We had many interesting chats over our cups of tea,
                    preferring to speak of the more esthetic side of the Japanese rather than the
                    horrible havoc they hurled on Honolulu that fatal day of December 7, 1941 when I
                    was there. Soon I met Margaret McCollough, an attractive Canadian widow who had
                    been living in Monte Carlo until just before the fall of France. We became
                    friends at once and our friendship was to last for many years. Then there was
                    Stewart Wilding, a jovial Englishman whose name appealed to me. We had fun
                    cycling and picnicking together.</p>
                <p>Several notes of introduction had been given to me before leaving Washington. One
                    was to Mr. Toddings, the publisher of the “Mid Ocean News,” which I presented
                    shortly upon arrival. The very next day after calling on him I found myself in
                    print. Little did I realize while we were chatting that my enthusiastic praise
                    of the island was making copy for his paper. How could I have been so naive. But
                    it was all true. Bermuda did seem to me like Tahiti and Hong Kong wrapped in one
                    and I did believe that I had found what I had been looking for. Always a lover
                    of islands and ever in search of the haven I felt I had found mine, especially
                    after witnessing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that suddenly plunged us
                    into World War II and weary war years working in Washington.</p>
                <p>A note to Sir Howard Trot was also given me. Trot was a name interwoven in the
                    history of the island when a family seat was established in the 17th century at
                    their home Walsingham. He offered me a job in the office of the Inverery that
                    began its career as a hotel in 1910.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Fate stepped in. A courtesy call was made one day at our American consulate, a
                    courtesy I knew was required of every traveler abroad. The consul who had a most
                    charming manner was Clay Merrill, a tall, broad shouldered man dressed in
                    tweeds. During the course of our conversation I just happened to mention that I
                    thought I would like to find a job some where, not really having in mind one
                    there. He asked me if I could type. I said that I could and then asked if he
                    would like to see a letter I was fortunate to possess from my brother-in-law's
                    father, the Honorable South Trimble, who had been for forty years clerk of the
                    House. He read the letter thoughtfully and in a few minutes looked up and with a
                    lovely economy of words said, “See my secretary, Lilly Olsen.” So I went into
                    her office where she began to iron out the logistical details of salary. Before
                    I knew it I had been given a job in the consulate. With the innocence of the
                    proverbial lamb I had suddenly embarked upon a career in the Foreign Service of
                    the United States State Department of which I was only vaguely familiar. But,
                    with characteristic optimism thought it might have a future. How little did I
                    know. I had been employed as a local and at a local's low salary, but I was
                    lucky for later the State Department was cutting down staffs in an economy drive
                    and no post could employ US citizens abroad. I was to be receptionist and
                    relieve the colored messenger boy, Arnold, who had been doing this as part time
                    duty. Never having had previous State Department training, I had it all to
                    learn.</p>
                <p>Now that I had a job my living arrangements became inadequate. The Everest was
                    comfortable for a short while, but I knew that I could not rest forever there
                    and it didn't fit in with my now small salary, so I made a change. I moved to
                    Ridlin, which was just around the corner on the other side of the cathedral and
                    still in Pembroke parish. There I had a very pleasant room in the home of one of
                    the old Bermudian families, the Sutherland Coopers. Three windows looked out
                    upon their green spacious lawn bordered by flower beds. When all of my own
                    things were unpacked and books arranged, it looked cozy and cheerful. Mrs.
                    Cooper was a dear. Often flowers from her garden were on my breakfast tray the
                    colored maid brought up to me every morning.</p>
                <p>The English-Speaking Union, familiarly known as the ESU, was just next door and
                    after I became a member I could go there for lunch or dinner or have tea with
                    friends. Some days, Arnold, the messenger boy, would bring me a sandwich which I
                    would have sitting on a bench beside the water and watch the little boats ride
                    gracefully at anchor in the port and have a stroll to sample the sea breeze. My
                    evening meal was usually taken at Ye Olde Copper Bowl, a sort of tea room
                    upstairs on Front Street where they began to know me and frequently prepared my
                    favorite dishes. On weekends I loved cycling along the calm country lanes with a
                    picnic lunch in my little wicker basket endeavoring to catch something of the
                    spirit of the place and people. Just to hear the tinkle of bicycle bells and
                    clip clop of the horses' hoofs and strange music of the sea was a delight.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The consulate was on the second floor of an office building at one end of famed
                    Front Street overlooking the harbor. It was just about a fifteen minute walk
                    from Ridlin to the consulate, but after I bought a secondhand bicycle I could
                    breeze down the hill to the office in five minutes. The Bermudians are born on
                    bicycles, everyone had one. It was the most popular means of conveyance. The
                    staff was small. The vice consul, Earl J. Richey, very good looking, just
                    married and still on his honeymoon; the secretary, Lilly Olsen; and Helen Fuss
                    who became my closest colleague; were the only other Americans. One local girl
                    took care of the files, issued the passports and visas and the other local girl
                    was the accountant. The office hours were from 9-5:15 Monday through Friday and
                    9-12:45 on Saturday. Thursday afternoon was always a holiday for the Bermudians
                    when the offices and the stores closed at noon. So our shopping was done on
                    Saturdays. But as a bonus we were given off the English, Bermudian and American
                    holidays which added up throughout the year. Every morning I reported to work
                    with a little bunch of violets I placed in the empty glass inkwell on my desk to
                    add a feminine touch, brighten the office and cheer the visa applicants as they
                    came in. Then I religiously read the big heavy black manual to have some idea of
                    what the consular work was all about.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Mrs. Merrill would flit in and out, now and then, with a cherry greeting for
                    everyone. She was a diminutive dynamo of a woman with a great flare for
                    decorating. The first thing that I liked about Bermuda was its traditional
                    tranquility. Bermuda's habits and way of life belonged to a distinctly gracious
                    age. The pace was leisurely and civilized. Transport was by a romantic horse
                    drawn surrey complete with fringe on top. The component part of Bermuda's charm
                    were its pretty pastel houses and their characteristic architectural features.
                    The early houses designed by men of nautical background were built of limestone
                    of which the island is composed. Soft enough to be cut with a hand saw it has
                    the accommodating property of hardening with age so that the longer a Bermuda
                    house stands the more firm its walls become. The white tiered roofs cascade to
                    catch the previous rain water had the refreshing appearance of being covered
                    with eternity snow. The abundance cedar of the island was not used for shingle
                    roofs, instead used for interior woodwork and floors the servants polished until
                    they could see their faces in them. The tray ceiling, traditional Bermudian
                    architecture, earns it name from the resemblance of a tray set upside down to
                    give coolness to the room. Windows of the houses are protected from gales,
                    hurricanes and strong sunshine by slatted shudders or blinds called by the more
                    picturesque name, jalousies, which let the air in but kept out the storms. A
                    charming feature of Bermuda architecture is the famous welcoming arms steps at
                    the front door that curve outward as they reach the ground in a gesture symbolic
                    of Bermuda hospitality. The semi-tropical climate was a paradise for foliage
                    plants where all the color was technicolor. Crotons are a favorite, sliding up
                    and down the color scale of yellows, coppers, scarlet, crimson and pink. Purple
                    bougainvillea cascaded over the walls of nearly every candy colored mansion and
                    cottage. Hibiscus and wild orchids were everywhere and freesia grew rampant
                    through the grass. One Sunday I went cycling for the expressed purpose of taking
                    photos of the emblems of purity and serenity, the masses of Easter lilies which
                    were just beginning to bloom and sweetening the air with their heavenly
                    fragrance. An early variety of the lily had been perfected and packed in bud and
                    shipped to all parts of the United States and Canada. A box of a dozen, the
                    minimum, was sent to my sister with a note asking her to take some to the grave
                    of my brother-in-law, Jim Trimble, who had died on his birthday, September 8,
                    1945 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Bermuda had many imports,
                    but this was the chief export. They were introduced here from Japan in the early
                    18 hundreds and the first shipment of Bermuda grown bulbs was exported in 1877
                    to Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>Nearing Christmas time a friend and I cycled out in the country to look for
                    holly. We met all kinds of people laden with it in their bicycle baskets and in
                    the backs of their cars. There was beginning to be too many of these now for
                    comfort on the narrow winding roads. So there was precious little holly left
                    when we arrived and we had to seek deep in the woods for it. We were rewarded by
                    coming on to a huge field of wild narcissus permeating the air with their
                    special fragrance. I gathered an arm full. Real mistletoe had just arrived from
                    the States and was in the florist shops. So my little room in Ridlin looked and
                    smelled sweet with vases for narcissus, poinsettias, which grew tall like trees
                    in the garden, sprigs of holly here and there and mistletoe hanging from the
                    ceiling gave a touch of Christmas spirit.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>But what really fascinated me was the passion flower. It was so beautifully
                    formed and had such an interesting story. The passion flower received its name
                    from the early Spanish missionaries in America. They saw in the flower the
                    emblem of the crucifixion of Christ. The purple color of the flower is symbolic
                    of mockery. It is the royal color of the robe which Christ wore when he was
                    hailed King of the Jews. When my friend, Margaret McCollough, sailed for the
                    States, I took three lavender ones to her. They only last a day but I was to
                    learn later how to wax these flowers to preserve them longer.</p>
                <p>The peach and white beaches with sand as fine as sifted flour were dazzling with
                    beautiful hidden coves for picnicking. The stillness was broken only by the
                    incessant murmur of the sea and cry of the sea gulls. Thanks to coral reefs that
                    form a protective ring the waves are tame for swimmers, restful and refreshing.
                    There are no man eating sharks about, they dare not brave the reefs. The
                    delicious water caresses one like silk. Whether you are in it, on it or under
                    it, it surrounds you. Water is the way of life in Bermuda. Everything conspires
                    to make it an ideal resort.</p>
                <p>But also Bermuda is steeped in history. Although discovered by a Spaniard, Juan
                    de Bermudez in 1503, had no Spanish panache whatsoever and was not to be visited
                    again until a hundred years later by an Englishman, Sir George Somers, who was
                    shipwrecked here and promptly claimed the land in the name of England. It was
                    colonized by the British in 1612 and 1614. Bermuda is Britain's oldest colony
                    and the evidence is delightfully apparent.</p>
                <p>To English visitors, Bermuda has an American flavor. Prices are quoted in dollars
                    as well as pounds. Yet to Americans, the nine parishes had English names
                    reflecting a strong British heritage. Warwick was given its name by the Earl of
                    Warwick and Devonshire was given its name in honor of the Earl of Devonshire.
                    Lord Paget was responsible of giving his name to the parish of Paget, a favorite
                    residential district with five estates that had well kept gardens and rare
                    plants and flowers and an unexcelled panoramic view of Hamilton. The oldest and
                    most picturesque of all is St. Georges where Steward Wilding and I cycled one
                    Sunday. A sleepy, semi-deserted town of 17th century mansions of Bermuda's
                    earliest families, ancient churches and outlying forts. St. Peters Church, the
                    oldest Anglican church in the Western Hemisphere, has wonderful carved cedar
                    wood and priceless communion service a gift from William III. The house is built
                    in the Georgian manner where soft limestone had mellowed into a pale, poetic,
                    honey gray. Old Rectory was the oldest, was built about 1705 by a reformed
                    pirate.Hamilton became Bermuda's capital in 1815 when the seat of government was
                    moved from St. Georges.</p>
                <p>We had our picnic lunch that day sitting by an old fort built in 1605 near the
                    sea. Returning to Hamilton we passed Kingley Air Force Base where the planes
                    come in and now United States property. The airport is at the extreme
                    northeastern part of the island so that the landings and takeoffs are primarily
                    over the ocean. When we returned we found we had cycled 24 miles. It had been a
                    wonderful outing to that old world part of the island.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Hamilton is as important as a port as it is a resort. The city's most endearing
                    quality is its intimacy. One finds it is just enough to sit and look at Front
                    Street from one of the veranda bars such as the Bar 21's canopied first floor
                    terrace where people gathered anytime from 11 in the morning onwards and enjoyed
                    the stately spectacle of liners arriving and departing from Hamilton. Ships on
                    one side of the street and shops on the other. Ships tied up almost to the lamp
                    posts, freighters, liners and cruise ships, to unload their cosmopolitan cargo.
                    Across the cobbled way are eight shops in renovated 18th century warehouses. Not
                    only the shops, but the lagoons and sea gardens hold treasures which skin divers
                    have rescued from Spanish galleons wrecked there in the 16th century.</p>
                <p>The work at the consulate was becoming increasing interesting as I was getting
                    more into the swing of things. But I was sorry to see my colleague, Helen Fus,
                    leaving on transfer to Lisbon. She had at one time worked with Walt Disney so
                    she was naturally very artistic with a delightful sense of humor. Some good news
                    that made it rather special coming as it did on the eve of my birthday, April 5,
                    was that Mr. Merrill asked me to learn the visa work now that Helen was leaving.
                    He said the work would increase later as most Bermudians go away in the summer.
                    Then they would get someone to take my place as receptionist. Well, Mr. Merrill
                    explained that he could not recommend me for a raise until I was there a year.
                    At least he would now have, he said, a base for asking for one when the time
                    came. So it was in a way a promotion and it pleased me very much. It was
                    something that really made me feel worthwhile. This enthusiastic encouragement
                    cheered me on my way. Little by little I began to take on more responsibility
                    and the workload became inconceivably heavy. There seemed to be an endless
                    stream of applicants. It was exhausting, but exhilarating and sometimes
                    hilarious.</p>
                <p>One day a buxom bosomed Negro woman, born in the West Indies, came in and every
                    answer to the barrage of questions asked her was “No thank you.” Question: Have
                    you ever been arrested? Answer: No thank you. Question: Are you divorced?
                    Answer: No thank you. And so on, until I could hardly suppress my amusement.</p>
                <p>The Reverend Eustice Moredant Strong, of St. John's Church in Pembroke had an
                    appointment one day. Before I could speak to him, he spoke to me. “Are you Mrs.
                    Biddle?” he began in a friendly way. “Well, I have had so many people tell me
                    about you that I must call on you. You live next door to the ESU don't you? And
                    you are Episcopalian aren't you?” All to which I acquiesced. Then we chatted
                    like old friends. He had been in Yokohama during the earthquake as had my
                    husband, but they both fortunately survived. It was sad to hear, however, that
                    his wife's first husband and child were both lost in that horrible tragedy that
                    ruined all of Yokohama and most of Tokyo. He had preached a memorial service in
                    the little church in Kobe where I had been married in 1930 and knew the Rev.
                    Ford there who had performed the ceremony, and Bishop Bryce Synder in Tokyo and
                    other dear friends in Japan. And by coincidence I had just received that morning
                    a card from Mrs. Bryce Synder which I showed to him. It did my heart good to
                    have this little visit with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One evening the Merrills gave a cocktail party for the men off the three American
                    ships in port—Fargo, Cleveland and Houston. Their beautiful home, originally
                    owned by Mrs. Hillbourne, was one of the show places of Bermuda. I met quite a
                    few people and enjoyed myself very much. Among the guests were His Excellency
                    the Governor and Lady Leatham and the mayor from Cleveland, the Governor's aide,
                    an attractive Englishman and also Admiral Braested, his aide and the two Cooper
                    boys who managed A &amp; S Cooper. The presence of the Governor and Admiral in
                    residence here added a special �clat to the social life of Bermuda.</p>
                <p>Friends were being made here and there. Stewart Wilding and I would often call on
                    Mrs. Jackson and her daughter Norma, Canadians who had a little place by the
                    water where we could watch the yacht races and unique sailing dinghies, stout
                    little boats found only on this island skim over the water. We met a most
                    interesting Englishman there one evening, a Mr. Jefferies. He was number two in
                    the Cable and Wireless office. He had lived on the peak when I was in Hong Kong
                    and we found we knew some of the same people. His wife and fifteen year old
                    daughter, a swimming champion training for the Olympics, were due out from
                    England soon. He was raving about the old house he had just found reeking with
                    tradition. The carriage house had originally been the first school on the island
                    and like many old homes here had one of the quaint bicycle sheds that everyone
                    had attached to their property. After his wife and daughter arrived I often
                    spent the day with the Jefferies at their home, the Bonnet. We would have our
                    gin and tonics on the sea wall, a delicious lunch in the garden and later tea on
                    the terrace overlooking the water. It was like being in a quiet corner of a
                    managed epic.</p>
                <p>Mr. Jefferies had traveled in so many countries and lived in most of them that
                    there wasn't a blank page in his passport. One visa read, “No time for
                    inquiries.” The Japanese were pounding on the door at the time it was being
                    issued. They would always urge me to stay on for supper and have a game of
                    bridge or mahjongg after, but I didn't like to cycle so far back to Hamilton
                    after dark. So then the decanter sherry was brought out and they would say,
                    “Well, then, one for the road.”</p>
                <p>Everyone was speaking about the deprivation in England, so I bundled up my polo
                    coat, added some nail polish, soap, jello and tin steak, and gave it all to an
                    Englishman going to Bristol to take to the mother of my friend, the second
                    officer with whom I had fenced on the Silver Laurel when going around the world
                    in 1939 and had been tragically lost in the North Sea during the war.</p>
                <p>May 9th was a great day. The new governor arrived and there was a huge
                    celebration. The band played the national anthems and Mr. Merrill appeared in
                    his frock coat with tails and top hat as he always did on State occasions. The
                    British soldiers looked smart marching down the street. A boy cycled by with a
                    bouquet of flowers tied with red, white and blue ribbons flying in the
                    breeze.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The young girl who had been in the visa section for five years resigned so I fell
                    heir to her job. Mr. Merrill had cabled for two girls to come down from the
                    Department about a week ago, but so far no word and we were getting busier and
                    busier. But the work was of enormous interest to me and I became so engrossed
                    that I was leaving the office just before seven and reaching the Ye Old Copper
                    Bowl for dinner just before they closed. This went on for about three months,
                    but I continued to work full time and overtime. Night after night I would cycle
                    my weary bones home and fall on my bed like an exhausted sparrow. I finally
                    began to decline invitations over the weekends just to stay home alone and rest.
                    My strength, I felt, should be conserved for the job. I couldn't afford to be
                    ill. I knew if I didn't take care of myself, the doctor would take care of me. I
                    was getting over tired, over worked and sometimes over wrought but knew that I
                    must treat each visitor and applicant with sympathy and courtesy, and one must
                    keep one's sanity, health and sense of humor.</p>
                <p>In the early tenure of my teething problems I learned that the greatest rewards
                    are in the inner satisfaction that comes with the discharge of duty. One's
                    conscientious efforts are the highest forms of compensation.</p>
                <p>One evening in June, the 16th to be exact, the Merrills gave a reception and
                    there I met Sir Anthony Eden who later became Lord Avon. He appeared in tennis
                    shoes but I thought he had probably just finished a set of tennis. But what
                    impressed me most were his magnetic eyes that seemed to be taking in everyone
                    and everything in one flashing moment.</p>
                <p>For several days Mr. Merrill had been absent from the office and appeared for the
                    first time on July 24th. When I went into his office for him to sign a visa I
                    said how nice it was to see him back, that we had missed him and hoped he was
                    well. This seemed to be an opportunity for him to unburden himself and he
                    replied in a cheerless voice that as a matter of fact he was not well, that he
                    had not had leave since 1941 and just thought that he was overtired. He then
                    added, “You must have been keeping you nose to the grindstone.” I replied, “Yes
                    sir,” and admitted that I had been arriving early and leaving late every night.
                    He then said in his fatherly way not to let it get under my skin and just not
                    try to do anymore than I could. This gave me a wonderful opportunity to ask him
                    if he was expecting anyone. He sighed that he had given up trying to get anyone
                    locally, but the State Department was sending down two girls, however he didn't
                    know when they would get here. But, he added, that will not make any difference
                    to you position and explained that he would put them in the visa section and I
                    could move into the office next to Mr. Richey, the vice consul, and do the
                    citizenship work which he said was more interesting and something to really get
                    one's teeth into. Or, he offered another suggestion, I could have a choice of
                    the work I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Helen Fus had not yet been replaced nor the girl who had left on May 25, but I
                    continued to carry the load the best I could. It was then that I began to learn
                    the wheels of the Department grin slowly and the slogan for every Foreign
                    Service employee should be “patience.”</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>One day at Mrs. Lightburn's house, she was a long time resident of Bermuda, I met
                    a most delightful Englishwoman, Mrs. Donald Smith. Another interesting link in
                    the chain of coincidences occurred when she happened to ask me if I knew
                    anything about a girls finishing school called Briar Cliff in the States, as she
                    was considering sending her daughter there. Well, the sound of my former beloved
                    boarding school in lovely Westchester County in New York suddenly stirred an
                    emotion in my heart. It had meant much to me and I felt a deep sentiment for it.
                    The teaching was excellent and the friendships were precious. I told her all I
                    could about it.</p>
                <p>One Sunday evening she invited me over to a buffet supper. Mr. and Mrs. Duncan
                    Goslane, Bermudian residents and two ex-Waves were there with a couple who had
                    just come down from the States by the name Bushnell. While chatting with Mr.
                    Bushnell, he mentioned that his wife was a writer. With great surprise I
                    immediately turned to her and exclaimed, “Why, are you Marjorie Wilson?” When
                    she acknowledged she was, I added with a school girl's sudden enthusiasm, “You
                    are the author of one of my favorite books, 'How To Live Beyond Your Means.'” It
                    was actually at that moment on my bedside table where I was re-reading it trying
                    to learn just how to live beyond my means. She really had the key to successful
                    living and thinking and it had practically become my bible. She said that “How
                    To Get The Most Out Of Your Wife” was the book she was now in the process of
                    writing. I liked her titles.</p>
                <p>The Bushnells called often at the consulate and one day she very kindly
                    autographed her book for me...To Mrs. Biddle with every kind wish, Marjorie
                    Wilson. They were buying a place called “Angle Steps” which the writer, Candace
                    Wells, had told them about. Mrs. Smith's husband, a lawyer was guiding them
                    through the legislature. It was a lot of red tape to buy property here. The name
                    was a romantic tribute to the bride of the first Mallory who lived there.</p>
                <p>It was quite unexpected, but very happy news to hear, that my salary had been
                    increased from $1080 to $1330 per year and my cost of living from $350 to $420
                    per year. The rental allowance of $600 per year remained the same. A five
                    percent old age tax comes out of it, but it boiled down to the fact that I was
                    making a $175 per month including allowances. Not a princely sum but hoped it
                    would help me to continue to cope with the pleasures and problems of living
                    abroad. Money, I decided should be watched, but not worried about.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>On August 22, we were all caught up in the feverish excitement of a Presidential
                    visit. President Truman was due at the Yacht Club at 5:00pm and we all left the
                    office promptly. I, for once, was able to leave the office while it was still
                    daylight and joyfully scooped up my papers and never got them in the safe and
                    locked up so quickly. It was nearly 5:30pm when the President finally drove out
                    in the Governor's carriage, followed by Mr. Merrill in a motor car and that was
                    all, except for a jeep that dashed by with photographers piled on top of each
                    other. The press had a field day. The general feeling after he passed was how
                    young he appeared. A couple remarked as they passed on their bicycles, “He is a
                    spry old man, isn't he.” He would have been given a 21 gun salute, the usual
                    courtesy for a dignity on official call, but it was a purely informal,
                    unofficial visit. Mr. Merrill said he had about an hour and a half with Harry
                    this morning and that he planned to be here about a week. It was all quite a
                    surprise. But apparently they changed their plans suddenly as New England was so
                    cold. Mr. Merrill was going to take Miss Olsen and me out to the yacht before he
                    sailed and had also invited several prominent Bermudian ladies including Lady
                    Essington, the American wife of Lord Essington and others. But Washington cabled
                    that due to the fact that there were no ladies aboard, the President could not
                    entertain any ladies, so the invitation was rescinded. Entertainment was, of
                    course, kept to the minimum. It was disappointing, but I was glad that he had
                    the undisturbed rest that he so wanted and probably needed. Never had I
                    forgotten how kind the Trumans had been when my brother-in-law had died. Mrs.
                    Truman was the first person to call on my sister after his death and came to the
                    funeral. I remember so well the beautiful spray of flowers they were very kind
                    to send.</p>
                <p>The next day it was a relief to hear that the two new girls, the Sullivan
                    sisters, would be arriving from the Department. They had previously been posted
                    at our embassy in Cuba. One would help me with the visas and the other would
                    take care of the mail. I was glad and very grateful. Summer visa applicants had
                    opened flood gates of work for our meager staff. With dogged perseverance, Mr.
                    Merrill had been a powerful pleader, never allowing his interest in the staff to
                    slumber and at last this was the result of his efforts and insistence.</p>
                <p>One noon, just as I was leaving the office, he asked me where I usually went for
                    lunch. When I answered, “The ESU, sir,” he said in his pleasant way, “Would you
                    like to have lunch with me at the New Windsor Hotel?” The invitation touched me
                    very much and as the ring in his voice sounded genuine, I accepted with
                    pleasure. We had delicious cornbeef hash and I thought of dear Father Trimble
                    who was fond of it and mentioned this to Mr. Merrill. It was a pleasant hour
                    spent chatting about sundry subjects and I had a simply lovely and totally
                    unselfconscious time. Walking back to the office he was ready to stop and chat
                    on the streets with anyone who accosted him and so many did. He was meeting
                    every fresh person with a sympathetic interest. The Bermudians worshiped
                    him.</p>
                <p>In September it began to get cooler and fortunately the summer work began to
                    slacken. I was now able to leave the office promptly at 5:15 every evening and
                    retiring between 9:30 and 10:00pm.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Charlie Biddle had been in and out of our post-marital life with brief meetings
                    at various times in various places around the world. We had lived through many
                    happy experiences together. We had a great deal of affection and esteem for each
                    other and there was no reason why that feeling couldn't be carried on as we went
                    our separate ways. It seemed a rather strange coincidence that a letter from him
                    posted from Port Said on August 1 and over two months on route should reach me
                    on October 11, the date we were married in Kobe, Japan. He was bound for
                    Singapore on his next assignment as manager of the National City Bank of New
                    York. He wrote that he understood it to be a better place than Japan or China
                    where he had lived before or even Manila where he was now, and thought he would
                    be out there three years, probably his last post as he would be near retiring
                    age after this assignment. Later he sent snapshots of the house he was sharing
                    with a doctor.</p>
                <p>A few days later Mr. Merrill planned to fly on the Admiral's plane to the States.
                    He was going to the hospital in New York, he said, to see about his heart and
                    then to the State Department to iron out some difficulties. One Sunday in late
                    October, a friend, Dotty Cane, who was secretary to Mr. Trimingham at the famous
                    Trimingham's store, and I took our bicycles on the ferry over to Somerset, one
                    of the prettiest parishes here. Then we cycled to Cambridge beaches for lunch
                    where most of the honeymooners stay. I could well understand it for it was
                    idyllic. Cambridge beaches was a wonderful getaway from it all, if one needed to
                    get away from anything on this beautiful island. It was an informal, thoroughly
                    charming cottage colony nestled in 25 acres of lawns and gardens surrounded on
                    two sides by the Atlantic and on the third side by Mangrove Bay with a number of
                    small natural beaches. The main house was built in 1675, one of the oldest on
                    the island. The roofs were all filled with the most attractive and unusual
                    flower arrangements. It would be difficult not to achieve something fairly
                    spectacular in the way of flower arrangements with the profusion of lilies,
                    hibiscus and wild orchids, so easily available here. Some door chimes over
                    cottages trimmed in blushing pink played “Here Comes the Bride.” After luncheon
                    we had a pleasant manager who asked us to come out again when May comes to the
                    island for when the oleanders were in bloom it was considered especially
                    beautiful.</p>
                <p>As we cycled on we passed Precious Place, Felicity Cottage, where the well-known
                    author Hervey Allen, lived five years while writing his “Anthony Adverse.” On an
                    outlying section of Bailey's Bay, Frances Hodgson Burnett had her workshop with
                    her son Vivian, prototype of Little Lord Fauntleroy, and labored six days a week
                    writing “The Secret Garden.” On Sunday she emerged from her studio to the
                    drawing room for tea for her at home to admirers. Kipling found it difficult to
                    work in Bermuda, he couldn't settle down to serious writing where he was too
                    concerned about his wife who was ill in hospital. Spitland, acquired fame as the
                    home where Eugene O'Neill wrote “Strange Interlude.”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Bermuda had some luxurious and fashionable resort hotels of which the Princess,
                    the oldest hotel there was completed in 1883, was named after Princess Louise,
                    Queen Victoria's daughter. But the whole pleasure of the island was to live a
                    more casual, informal type of life in a carefree atmosphere in one of these
                    charming cottage colonies which Bermuda may have been the original exponent.</p>
                <p>Another Sunday we cycled out into the country and lunched at Harmony Hall a
                    quaint and quiet place with the atmosphere of a Bermudian estate home. Then
                    cycled over to another called Horizons, a typical old Bermuda mansion
                    overlooking the Coral Beach Club. It was so refreshing to get out like this on
                    Sunday, a day of relaxation, after the expenditure of so much energy throughout
                    the week and the weather was perfect. Mrs. Gary and I often cycled together. She
                    was the assistant manager at Waterloo House, an adorable place on the water. It
                    was originally built as a town house about a hundred years ago and now was a
                    popular guest house with unusual atmosphere. The hotel would put up a lunch for
                    us and one day we cycled along the south shore road to Pink Beach until we came
                    to a place by a bed of Easter lilies. Seduced by the sweetness, we spread
                    ourselves a lunch on the lawn and basked in the most heavenly sunlight while the
                    waves dashed against the rocks. It was peace, perfect peace.</p>
                <p>On November 25 I received a letter with the shocking and very sad news of the
                    death of dear Father Trimble as he was affectionately known by the family. The
                    nurse said he died in his sleep just like a candle going out at four o'clock in
                    the morning at the age of 83. The memory of the last time I saw him swept over
                    me when the dear that he was had walked all the way down the station platform to
                    the train with me to say goodbye when I left Washington. A little blue wool
                    scarf had been enclosed in my last letter to him because I remembered how he
                    suffered from pneumonia last winter and hoped it had reached him. My sister
                    wrote that she had placed a little bouquet of violets and forget-me-nots beside
                    him. A sweet gesture I thought and just what I would have liked to have done had
                    I been there. His many great kindnesses to me would never be forgotten. At the
                    library I found the New York Times for November 24 giving the detailed account
                    of his death — A wonderful man had been taken from the affection of his family
                    and countless friends and would be sorely missed and long remembered with great
                    admiration. I always felt that it was due to his kind letter I presented to Clay
                    Merrill that helped to launch me on a career in the Foreign Service for which I
                    will be forever grateful. So it was a pleasant respite to be invited by friends
                    to go out in their motor boat to listen to a concert at the Inverery Hotel that
                    retained its original colonial charm. The music was very soothing, echoing
                    across the water under a full moon.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>When I was laid up in bed with a cold one day, a letter came from my sister
                    telling me of a delightful dinner party she had attended at the White House and
                    how much she had enjoyed seeing the film, “The Great Waltz” after. She had also
                    enclosed sketches of the Monroe Room that Mrs. Truman had asked her to
                    redecorate. The thought of seeing the fruits of her labor before too long,
                    brightened the day. She had previously written that she had been given a job
                    with the Veteran Administration and soon after created the color design section,
                    so she was using her talents to replace color for the dull, drab buff of the
                    veterans rooms.</p>
                <p>We were given a half holiday on December 23 and did not have to return until
                    December 27. Christmas in Bermuda was said not to be Christmas without casaba
                    pie so I was curious to try it. A friend of mine happened to learn that it was
                    on the menu at the Hearthstone, a new restaurant that had just opened. The
                    question was, “Was it animal, vegetable or mineral?” The answer is, “All three.”
                    Different people make it different ways. It is eaten at breakfast, lunch, dinner
                    and in between, hot or cold, fried in butter. The casaba, itself, originally
                    came from the West Indies and grows here on the bush. But it is the root that is
                    used for the pie. We saw it later hanging in the grocery store about three feet
                    long. The outside bark is peeled off. Then the yellow bark and the rest is
                    ground until most of the juice comes out. We were glad to have the opportunity
                    of tasting it and it was delicious. After dinner we attended the midnight
                    services at the cathedral. The music and dignitary of the ceremonies were
                    inspiring and impressive.</p>
                <p>Christmas day I had been invited to the Greens. Sheila was a young English girl
                    about 19, bright and interesting with whom I had become very friendly. Her
                    younger sister, Diana, had not only a beautiful face, but was talented as a
                    ballet dancer. Their father and mother were most charming. Dr. Green was judge
                    of the Prize Court in Bermuda. He had been judge of the High Court in Gibraltar
                    and had had similar positions in several other countries. Mrs. Green had gone
                    with her husband to Algeria, then to Jerusalem, and then for nine years they
                    were in Cyprus. Sheila said we were to play games so wear an old evening dress.
                    With my evening dress tucked in the bicycle basket I cycled over to Villa Rosa,
                    the Green's place in Paget, painted the yellow saffron color that is so often
                    seen in Bermuda houses. We were passing all the way men in dinner jackets on
                    their bicycles and ladies in long evening dresses pedaling valiantly in high
                    heel slippers. When I arrived they greeted me with the news we had all been
                    invited across the road for Christmas dinner with Mrs. Tompkins. It seemed the
                    Greens' supper party had increased to 21 and this would give their maids time to
                    prepare for it without stopping to prepare our dinner. Mrs. Tompkins was a widow
                    living in a huge handsome house on the hill overlooking the water with a lovely
                    view call Mangrove Villa. She was an old friend of the Merrills, interested in
                    politics and greatly saddened over the death of Father Trimble, who she
                    knew.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>After dinner, about 3:00pm, we came back to help Mrs. Green with the elaborate
                    preparations for the Christmas party. The maids had left and there was still
                    lots to do. There was so much food, a huge turkey, a beautiful ham, beef mold,
                    two kinds of salads, candied sweet potatoes, beets, olives, all kinds of sweets,
                    fruit, nuts, dates and Christmas candies. The Christmas pudding with the
                    tradition of brandy sauce, flaming while the lights were out was a lovely sight.
                    Colorful favors and little caps were at each place and when champagne was
                    served, Dr. Green rose and proposed a toast to absent friends. Other toasts
                    followed. Then we all chorused in with “He's a jolly good fellow,” after
                    toasting Dr. Green and his family. The boys were all in the service and in
                    uniform and most of them off the Sheffield, Flag ship of the British fleet.
                    There were three American girls besides myself, one Bermudian and one English
                    girl who had just come out to join her husband, Mrs. Pearson Jones. After dinner
                    we played all sorts of games, danced and did the Lambeth Walk, reminding me of
                    the days when everyone was doing it at the Hong Kong hotel in 1939 while I was
                    waiting for a ship to continue on around the world. Mrs. Green looked so pretty
                    and sweet as she sat playing at the piano. I said to her how kind she was to do
                    all these kind things for so many people. Some of the boys she did not even
                    know. She replied, “Well, they have after all done so much for us during the
                    war.” Dr. Green had gone out to play bridge at the Bermuda Bridge Club where he
                    tops all the lists. Then I cycled home after dark serenaded by the tree toads
                    beginning their evening exquisitely, rarely seen but always heard.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The day after Christmas was boxing day, the most British of holidays. I was just
                    getting dressed when each member of the Cooper family came running upstairs to
                    tell me to hurry down, the Gombies were coming. There had been quite a commotion
                    below and when I looked out of my window I saw a perfect parade of weirdly
                    costumed men and boys coming down the road headed by two drummers. By the time I
                    got down to the front door, four of the most fantastically dressed men and boys
                    were going through some kind of dance to the wild beating of drums. The costumes
                    were made of bright colored materials and looked like silk pajamas with fringe
                    around them. Their black colored capes were covered with millions of different
                    colored ribbons tied in bows with streamers hanging down and emblazoned with
                    numerous small mirrors. One little fellow had hanging down his front one of
                    these old fashioned souvenir pillows with God Bless Our Home embroidered on it.
                    Hats were covered with gold paper and stuck with peacock feathers four feet
                    high. A vestige of the Gombies African background. All wore strange and horrible
                    looking masks and carried spears, bows and arrows. One man, not in costume
                    carried a bag which looked like an old flour sack for the coins we were to
                    throw. When they returned about 5 o'clock in the afternoon it was bulging. They
                    go all over the island followed by a throng of colored young and old, on foot
                    and on cycle and must have permission to come out and only on boxing day. This
                    strange and colorful performance is not native to Bermuda but was introduced
                    during the past 50 years by natives of the West Indies who settled in Bermuda.
                    It is a mixture of Carib war dances combined with African tribal ritual. They
                    were led by Charles Norford, otherwise known as Shaky Bean, getting his nickname
                    from the dexterity with which he performed his parts. It was he who had brought
                    them from St. Kitts in 1922 and was active in keeping the Gombie dances alive.
                    To the uninformed, the dancers look like meaningless capering and chanting, but
                    actually there are several plays, each of which tells a story. Originally the
                    Gombie dancers were the means by which illiterate natives preserved their
                    history and folklore. In Bermuda they are a colorful annual festival that adds
                    an unexpected touch of the primitive to the clean and civilized aspect of the
                    mid Atlantic resort.</p>
                <p>After this excitement I went over to sit with Mrs. Lightfoot, the manager of ESU,
                    on the spatial lawn of the club next door. Then cycled to Flats in South Parish,
                    some miles along the shore to gather some narcissus to take to Mrs. Tompkins who
                    had given us such a delightful Christmas dinner.</p>
                <p>Back in the office, after the long holidays, Mr. Merrill said a robber tried to
                    get into their place and he had quite a tussle with him so he had a rather
                    unnerved holiday. The robber was later caught at the historic Mid-Ocean Golf
                    Club where Churchill and Eisenhower met in 1942.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>New Year's Day was so glorious and warm I cycled alone along the north shore road
                    feeling the need of a quiet reverie, then lunched at Angel's Cross Road,
                    overlooking Harrington Sound. After, I gathered some while narcissus for Mrs.
                    Cooper. Now the time had come to put gloves in glass jars to keep them from
                    molding just as we had done in Japan. But here it was in January and there it
                    was in July called the Nubei season. It was not wise to keep furs in this
                    climate long so I sold my raccoon coat to a little old lady staying at the ESU
                    who was returning to England. Walter Spurly, nephew of Sir Stanley Spurly, was
                    trying to help me brush up on my bridge. He was a wizard and had written on his
                    Christmas card, “May 1947 bring more and better bridge.” One evening he invited
                    me to the overseas league for dinner and to play bridge with Hilda Evans and an
                    amusing Canadian, Walter Stout Scott who played the piano as beautifully as he
                    played bridge.</p>
                <p>On January 29 I had been here a year and the Sullivan sisters invited me to the
                    21 Club to celebrate after work. When we arrived I happened to see Walter
                    Masters seated with his brother-in-law, Mr. Fountain, just returned from Sierra
                    Leone and had been much in the press, and another man, Mr. Young who was in the
                    Colonial Treasury. They all joined us, so it was a gay celebration. When I
                    returned to the consulate I reminded Mr. Merrill that I had been here a year
                    today and had asked him if it would be agreeable I would like to take my holiday
                    in April, to which he was agreeable.</p>
                <p>On George Washington's birthday, Mrs. Merrill invited the staff out to Tucker's
                    Town to their new place the government had just bought, Doggamore. We were shown
                    all over. It had belonged to a fabulously wealthy woman, Mrs. Wear, and had been
                    completely furnished in the most perfect taste. Some of the furniture was
                    handmade, complete with the needlepoint on the chairs. The lace curtains at the
                    doors had been especially made in France. Mrs. Merrill had added her artistic
                    touches here and there. The grounds were spacious and lovely. All kinds of
                    little cottages for this and that were everywhere. The luncheon was delicious
                    and champagne was served to celebrate the day.</p>
                <p>During Lent I had given up my bridge on Fridays to attend some Lenten lectures in
                    the evening at the cathedral. When Walter Spurly called me for a game, I
                    declined explaining, “Never on Fridays during Lent.” Margaret Pearson Jones and
                    Paula Wattly gave an amusing party at their flat at Spanish Point one evening.
                    Margaret was as pretty as a picture and Paula kept me uproariously amused. She
                    was of Latvian origin and had been on the stage in England and France for ten
                    years since the age of ten. It was very gay and became gayer when Walter
                    suggested that we all go to his house and he would play for us. When we lunched
                    together a few days later, he mentioned that his father had been one of the
                    three founders of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>A new girl, Ruth Yarber, awfully nice, arrived on March 18. She had been at the
                    embassy in Brussels. On the twenty seventh of March I wrote a letter home —”If
                    all goes well will be in New York a week from today. Feel so in need of good
                    rest and good food. Have many plans and people want to see in the State
                    Department about various matters so we will be busy. Have a seat on the 10:00am
                    plane leaving April 3. Getting awfully excited about holiday now I have ticket
                    in hand and finally manage my first vacation home.”</p>
                <p>As soon as I arrived in Washington, I went immediately to the State Department
                    and when I walked into one of the offices to pay my respects, the girls all
                    looked up most startled to see me and exclaimed in amazement, “Why, we thought
                    you were in Quito.” With great surprise I said, “Quito, where is that?” “Well,”
                    they continued ignoring my ignorance, “Your orders must have arrived after you
                    left Bermuda, but while you are here you may as well take the test.” “ Test?” I
                    said puzzled, “Test for what?” “For high altitude.” And then came the answer,
                    “It is in Ecuador.” I went through the test, passed it, but apparently turned
                    blue, so they announced, “Now we are going to send you to a lovely place on the
                    Mediterranean.” By this time I was beginning to feel slightly dizzy, not from
                    the test, but from the sudden geographical jump. When I asked, “Where on the
                    Mediterranean?” it was Tangier. This sounded interesting, but what made me
                    really happy was when they added, “You have been reclassified, upgraded with an
                    increase of salary. In other words a big promotion.” Of course I was elated but
                    quickly explained that I had come for a month's holiday with only one suitcase
                    and would have to return to Bermuda to pack up. This was, of course, understood
                    and permitted. But before I left it was necessary to go through an ordeal of
                    shots in the medical unit for my new post, Tangier. When I returned to my
                    sister's apartment in Georgetown where I was staying and announced the news, we
                    began to get down all the National Geographic and travel magazines to look up
                    everything we could on Tangier and began to put away everything we had taken
                    down the night before on Quito. All I remember about Quito was that it sits
                    astride the equator where it is possible to stand with one foot in each
                    hemisphere. Tangier sounds much more intriguing.</p>
                <p>The month's holiday in Washington flew by. My sister and I had celebrated our
                    birthdays together, April 5 and 15 with rooms filled with Easter lilies and
                    passion flowers brought from Bermuda. We had seen many friends, gone to the
                    theater several times and before I knew it I was on the Fort Townsend bound back
                    to Bermuda on Saturday, May 3, just exactly a month to the day I had left the
                    island.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The weather was cold and damp and so foggy the fog horns were constantly tooting.
                    We passed the Fort Amherst on route to New York, the ship my friend Walter Stout
                    Scott had just taken from Bermuda. There were lots of young girls aboard, very
                    few men and the usual honeymoon couples. Bermuda was a magic name to them. I had
                    been feeling very fit until after breakfast on Sunday, but from then on I had
                    never been so miserable with seasickness on any voyage, and counting this one it
                    was my 15th including a trip around the world. Ninety out of 105 passengers were
                    in the same condition. It was said to be most unusual for this time of year. The
                    weather was absolutely foul. It rained, thundered, lightninged and the ship
                    rolled and pitched and acted up very badly. Fortunately we had a heavy cargo. It
                    was impossible for me to stay below in my cabin so I slept on a sofa near a door
                    on an upper deck to get as much fresh air as possible and lived on celery and
                    ginger ale, the proper diet I remembered for those suffering mal de mer and
                    finally chicken sandwiches when I could keep them down. After the weather
                    cleared and the sun came out and the sea was smoother, I sat in my deck chair
                    and became as red as a lobster. When I looked in the mirror I decided the pale
                    wane look was more becoming and began dabbing my sunburned face with vinegar.
                    There were no rose tinted mirrors on this ship to give a psychological boost to
                    seasick passengers as on the great Queen Mary. But it was such a relief to be a
                    perpendicular passenger once more and to be able to go to the dining room for a
                    good dinner and feel quite myself again. Now I could agree with Mark Twain when
                    he said, “Bermuda is a paradise, but you have to go through hell to get
                    there.”</p>
                <p>We were due next day at 8:30am and I was never so anxious to survey the terra
                    firma again. The ship arrived on time and at 10:00am and a launch took me over
                    to the Naval dispensary where Mr. Richey, the vice consul, had arranged for me
                    to have my third shot for typhoid and second for typhus in preparation for my
                    new assignment, Tangier.</p>
                <p>When I reached the consulate I had a little visit with Mr. Merrill and Mr.
                    Richey. Mr. Merrill said that he was glad the Department had told me of the good
                    recommendation that he had given me for he couldn't. Bless his kind heart. They
                    brought me up to date with the news of the office. One Sullivan girl resigned to
                    defect to the altar with a chap she had known at the embassy in Cuba, and her
                    sister left without permission. The Department had not approved her leave of
                    absence so she went anyway. What is going to happen to her? Goodness only knows.
                    No one had taken the place of the receptionist who had resigned April 19. The
                    consulate had frantically called the girl who had resigned this time last year
                    and wanted her to come back. She had declined saying she had worked too hard for
                    too little. So the office was certainly depleted. I was also feeling deeply
                    concerned about Mrs. Merrill because I had become very fond of her. She was
                    quite ill in the hospital with bursitis, crazed with pain and kept doped with
                    drugs so much she was very near a nervous breakdown. Finally it was her colored
                    maid who cured her with a simple old West Indian remedy—rum and menthol crystals
                    which I later used on occasion. But it is not to be taken internally.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The weather was quite nippy and I discovered there was terrific lack of precious
                    water, a perpetual problem here. However, it poured, simply poured over the
                    weekend, which helped. With every day that passed I hoped for news from the
                    Department regarding my transportation to Tangier, but plan to be ready for the
                    May 26 sailing from Bermuda so immediately plunged into preparation. On May 22 I
                    had all my possessions packed. What a job. It was getting hot now. My friends
                    were so kind in wanting to entertain me before leaving. The consulate became
                    momentarily calm and tranquil so I slipped into a holiday mood. A most enjoyable
                    evening was spent with the Jefferies. Mr. Jefferies had been a junior with the
                    Cable and Wireless in Tangier in 1919 and gave me a lot of information and names
                    of people to look up. His uncle was president of the French Bank there and he
                    showed me photos of his lovely villa. He had not heard from him since before the
                    war and was anxious for me to send news of him. He advised me not to take my
                    bicycle, I would lose face riding it out there. Apparently it just isn't done in
                    the land of the Moors. When I asked what I would use to get around, with tongue
                    in cheek and smiling he said, “A donkey.” So I began to try to sell it.
                    Interesting tidbits I gleaned were there were French, English and American post
                    offices and three different types of currency used. Certain things were paid
                    with French francs and others paid with Spanish pesetas, Moorish currency. It
                    was best to buy things in Gibraltar, which was only about twenty minutes by
                    plane and four hours by ferry. When shopping I should hire a little Arab boy to
                    carry my packages, etc., etc. It was wonderful to talk to someone who had lived
                    there. One of the Cooper boys asked me to send him some goat skins as he did
                    beautiful bookbinding and heard that it is the best place to get the best
                    skins.</p>
                <p>Paula Watley wanted me to meet her husband also attached to the Sheffield and the
                    Captain so I had cocktails there one evening. On May 26 my travel orders finally
                    came through but no indication of whether the Department was arranging
                    transportation out of New York to Tangier or if this office should. So a cable
                    was sent to ask. My baggage had gone to the dock and I was already to sail if
                    word from the Department came through in time to go. At 2:00pm still no cable.
                    The ship was due to sail at 3:00pm. So I sent my baggage on bill of lading for
                    instructions to Howard Fife, US Despatch Agent in New York. Mr. Ross Cooper, the
                    Cooper family were all over the island, in charge of baggage couldn't have been
                    more helpful in rushing everything through for me. When time grew short and no
                    cable had been received, I just decided not to sail as long as my baggage had
                    gone I could fly. Then a message was received from Becky Sanford in the
                    transportation section of the Department that she was unable to secure space on
                    any ship to Tangier and advised that I sit tight in Hamilton until could advise
                    definite date of departure from New York and would wire just as soon as had a
                    date.</p>
                <p>So I canceled my Junior League reservation at the Waldorf, where in those days
                    the unbelievable rate was only $3.00 per night, and relaxed relieved to know at
                    last that they were working on it. Any action was a relief.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>During this period waiting, a glamorous yacht appeared on the horizon and
                    anchored off shore. It was the Sea Cloud, the biggest yacht in the world
                    belonging to Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress of Palm Beach and Washington.
                    The name Who Saw had been diplomatically changed to the more ethereal one of Sea
                    Cloud. In 1936 it had been sent to Leningrad where Joseph E. Davies, her new
                    husband, was then our US ambassador to the Soviet Union and who was now said to
                    be ill aboard with intestinal trouble. The Sea Cloud's peaceful voyaging was
                    interrupted in 1942 when she was leased by the US Navy who equipped her with
                    deck guns and put her on convoy duty. After the war, Mrs. Post had it refinished
                    and refurbished to operate again. It was while posted in Leningrad that Mrs.
                    Post began to collect her fabulous Russian treasures which are said to be the
                    finest outside the Hermitage. I remember how enchanted I was with these
                    treasures, especially the Faberge Easter eggs that the members of the imperial
                    family gave to each other as gifts. I saw them in her home, Hillwood, where she
                    lived like a queen and was noted for the sheer grandeur of her lifestyle. Her
                    jewels were as fabulous as her homes. She often wore a tiara, her favorite, that
                    Napoleon had given his queen, Louise, when she bore him a son. Mrs. Post had
                    been decorated by five countries—Luxembourg, Belgium, Dominican Republic, Brazil
                    and France. We were introduced one evening at a party in the Belgrade Club in
                    Washington and her regal bearing was deeply impressive.</p>
                <p>David Aires, an attractive decorator friend from Palm Beach was holidaying in
                    Bermuda at Cambridge Beaches, and invited me out for cocktails and supper one
                    Sunday evening. We were served on the hotel's flowered terrace overlooking the
                    water and entertained by native men singing amusing calypso songs. It was a
                    delightful setting and a thoroughly enjoyable evening. I had taken the ferry
                    over but had an opportunity of riding on the little train for the first time
                    coming back in the moon light. It amused me to listen to the conversation of the
                    native Bermudians.</p>
                <p>In the office I was doing a great deal of nothing, now that it was adequately
                    staffed, and growing restless. The waiting around was getting very tiresome.
                    Excerpts from my diary began to read:</p>
                <p>May 31 - Clipped from New York Times notice of ship going Tangier from
                    Marseilles. Sent to Becky Sanford, thought it a way of getting started.</p>
                <p>June 2 - Had definite reservations on Pan Am June 11. Trying not to get too
                    anxious and fret too much about the situation and enjoyed the beach. Do not
                    quite know what to do about accepting invitations.</p>
                <p>July 1 - Heard Betty Sutherland had been transferred to Rabat about 300 hundred
                    miles from where I shall be. She had been transferred back to Cuba but people
                    were needed in North Africa so she was reassigned. Beginning to think about
                    getting my French visa extended, it will expire July 17. Someone said it takes
                    ages to get visas.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>July 9 - Going around in old faded things plan to give away becomes a bit
                    demoralizing but reluctant to wear clothes that packed to take with me.</p>
                <p>I had waited and waited and lived out of my suitcase for weeks and weeks. Then
                    suddenly the long wait gave birth to a brainstorm. I decided to write a letter
                    to Miss. Eugenia Ann Wallace, Department of State, Foreign Service Personnel,
                    African Area, Washington, DC which read:</p>
                <p>Dear Miss Wallace: I am still in Bermuda waiting transportation to Tangier. It
                    has occurred to me that it may be possible for me to proceed to the United
                    States and await transportation there. It would give me an opportunity of
                    attending classes in the Foreign Service Institute or acquiring more experience
                    in filing by working in the Department. Either or both would be beneficial to me
                    at my new post. I am also interested to know when my new salary rate will become
                    effective. Any suggestions you might have regarding my situation will be very
                    much appreciated.</p>
                <p>In the light of later experience I thought only a naive and new member of the
                    Foreign Service would have the audacity to write such a letter, but it brought
                    an immediate telegraphic reply. On July 18 I finally received word I had been
                    trying so patiently to wait for. The Department cabled: 17th for Virginia Biddle
                    holding berth Mauritania July 31 New York to France, French Algiers. Suggest
                    coming time for sailing. Advise arrival, signed Marshall.</p>
                <p>This, of course, meant I would sail in the Cunard Mauritania that by curious
                    coincidence happened to be in port the day I sailed from New York to Bermuda in
                    May. This majestic liner was preparing then for her maiden voyage, the flags
                    flying and looking very festive. Never dreaming that I would be sailing on her a
                    few months later.</p>
                <p>I booked a seat on Pan Am leaving Bermuda Sunday, 4:00pm July 27 due in New York
                    7:30pm. My French visa had expired. I thought I would write the French consul
                    for an appointment. I wired to renew my reservation for a Junior League room at
                    the Waldorf. On July 19 I sent a cable to my sister—Flying New York July 27.
                    Sailing Mauritania July 31. Have reservation Waldorf. Advise and can join me.
                    Letter on route. Love Virginia.</p>
                <p>No matter how much I had enjoyed my post, once assigned to another I was eager to
                    be on my way and the thought of traveling towards Tangier gave me a tremendous
                    thrill but I knew I would never forget all of my kind friends and colleagues and
                    above all the Merrills for whom I had developed great professional respect and
                    strong friendship and would always remember the sound of waves on coral rocks
                    and the perfume of Easter lilies on that little dot in the middle of Atlantic
                    wither the fates had led me. As I said goodbye Bermuda you have put sunshine
                    into my life, health into my body and a new brave spirit into my heart.</p>
                <p>Tangier - August 1947 to October 1949</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>In a letter to my sister with the heading Cunard White Star RMS Mauritania,
                    August 5, 1947: Dearest Mildred: When this majestic white Cunard liner, the
                    Mauritania slowly slide from her moorings the last snap of the serpentine was
                    like a tug at the heart strings as I waved goodbye to you looking so beautiful
                    with bright light shining on your face. I stood at the railing until you
                    vanished in the distance. Then the skyline of Manhattan gradually disappeared
                    and a full moon came up over the horizon. Finally I turned to saunter down the
                    deck to the little veranda at the stern of the ship when I saw somebody coming
                    towards me in the fading light whose face looked vaguely familiar. We both
                    recognized each other at the same time and suddenly embraced. It was Henrietta
                    Quade whose husband was with General Motors when we both lived in Japan in the
                    early thirties. They were later posted in Java where I had last seen them when I
                    was on route around the world aboard the Silver Laurel in 1939. Mr. Quade had
                    sent a telegram to me when I arrived in Batavia for the day and couldn't have
                    been kinder. It happened that a diplomatic friend, Mr. Dickover, was now on post
                    in Batavia and we made a call on him and his new wife and reminisced about our
                    days in Japan where he had been posted. Mr. Quade had been interned for 3 �
                    years in Java during the war and I remember reading how he had protected the
                    refugees in his place during the strife there. They were now on their way to
                    England, France, Switzerland and Egypt where he was to be regional director for
                    General Motors in that part of the world and the Far East.</p>
                <p>Shortly after sailing Senator Alexander Wiley, the right wing Republican from
                    Wisconsin, to whom you had introduced me, came over to my table in the dining
                    room to present his wife. They had been seated at the Captain's table just next
                    to mine. I had been placed with a chit looking French woman and a couple whose
                    names I did not yet know. After a few pleasantries, the Wileys left and I turned
                    to the gentleman sitting next to me and apologized for not introducing them
                    saying, “but I don't believe I know your name.” He replied, “Richelieu.” Before
                    I could even say, “Oh, the Duke de Richelieu,” the chit French woman, whose name
                    I later learned was Mrs. Woolf, suddenly burst forth in an excited flow of
                    French, “Le Duc.” After dinner the Duchess drew me aside on the deck and
                    explained that Mrs. Woolf's husband, Robert, had called on her husband just the
                    night before he committed suicide over some bank affair two or three years ago
                    and she had always wondered what had transpired between the two men. It was a
                    most dramatic introduction.</p>
                <p>The four of us became very congenial. The Duke was an extraordinarily brilliant
                    and exceeding interesting man having lived in many countries and spoke many
                    languages and talked to me a great deal about everything. He said he was envious
                    of my going to Tangier because things were attainable there now not found in
                    Paris or in London. One day while speaking of Lady Windermere's Fan, the Duke
                    mentioned that Oscar Wilde had dedicated most of his important books to his
                    mother who married Prince Albert of Monaco. He confessed he preferred now to
                    live in a simple small apartment devoid of too many possessions and had given
                    the Sorbonne all of his valuable family portraits and extensive library. The
                    Duchess before her marriage was Douglas Wise, an American from Baltimore,
                    Maryland. She was very unassuming. Neither she nor the Duke dressed for dinner,
                    though many did. And they retired early.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>A few days before we were to leave the ship, the Duchess said to her husband at
                    the table, “Arman, you must give Mrs. Biddle a note of introduction to our old
                    French friend, M. Jacque de Marquet in Tangier. Whereupon the Duke turned to me
                    and gave a most vivid description of him. He was an authority on sand script, a
                    great scholar steeped in the philosophies of the East, had written many books
                    and given lectures. Then leaning over to me added in almost a whisper, “but, a
                    most peculiar man!” I naturally was intrigued.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Woolf and I had our deck chairs beside each other and became very friendly.
                    She gave me information about Paris and suggested I go to see a collection and
                    ask for the person who had taken care of her for 25 years. I was flattered when
                    one day she complimented me on the way I dress. Little did she know my clothes
                    were mostly hand-me-downs from you, my dear sister.</p>
                <p>Some days Henrietta Quade and I would play deck tennis or swim together. She had
                    an exotic oriental face and the Duke was interested in knowing who she was. I
                    didn't ever know what blood ran through her veins.</p>
                <p>An interesting Scottish woman, Mrs. Synder, shared my cabin. She lived for
                    several years in Sarawak, Borneo and many out of the way places and was so
                    pleasant. I shall be sorry to see her leave when she disembarks at Cobb
                    tomorrow. She gave me a note of introduction to an American friend in Paris,
                    Countess de Dawn, whose son was second secretary at our embassy in Rome and her
                    brother-in-law military attach� at the legation Bern, Switzerland.</p>
                <p>Then very early Thursday we arrived in Cherbourg. We were able to buy our tickets
                    and make our reservations from Cherbourg to Paris aboard the ship. It takes
                    about five or six hours and costs $11.80. I had just obtained a receipt and
                    discovered that I am in the same compartment with six men. Good heavens!</p>
                <p>It was wonderful that you could have been in New York with me just before I
                    sailed. Please write as often as possible for I am already missing you very
                    much. Will write about Paris later but want this posted at Cherbourg. Love,
                    Virginia.</p>
                <p>When we reached Cherbourg I disembarked and took the boat train to Paris with Amy
                    Porterfield who had been aboard and was being assigned at the embassy there. The
                    last time I saw Paris was in 1934 when my sister and I stayed at the elegant
                    hotel Bristol and did a lot of sightseeing. But Paris now, in 1947, was quite
                    different. Although the war had been over for one and a half years, food was
                    scarce, bread inedible and few cars, but that however was a blessing. She was
                    struggling to find her feet politically and economically. At the same time
                    reconstruction and renewal of tourism was gradually coming back to life.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>A reservation had been made for me at an old French hotel where many of the State
                    Department stayed. It was conveniently located directly behind the embassy on a
                    little side street and across from the more affluent Hotel Crillon which faces
                    the Place de la Concorde. The fashionable shopping street, Faubourg Saint
                    Honor�, was a block away so I felt in the center of things.</p>
                <p>There was a shabby sort of charm about the building and its French staff that
                    appealed to me. When the Duke of Richelieu came to take me to luncheon one day,
                    he looked up at the entrance, a smile on his face and said, “I remember when I
                    called on the Queen of Naples when she lived here twenty years ago.</p>
                <p>I was surprised to find myself making a rather prolonged stay in Paris. The
                    embassy was endeavoring to obtain a visa for me to travel through Spain to
                    Tangier, but at that time Spain tended to be rather erratic about issuing visas
                    to Americans. While waiting, though, I managed to enjoy myself. Amy Porterfield
                    and I would browse around when she was not on duty at the embassy. We strolled
                    along the Left Bank, stopped at the book stalls, snapped photos of each other,
                    then went to dine some where. When I studied the long French menu, all I could
                    remember from my rusty boarding school French was “langouste.” French waiters
                    being what they are will do little more than endure your presence with their
                    slightly superior smiles and were no help whatsoever in translating and I was
                    too shy to ask. So I was constantly ordering lobster.</p>
                <p>I was also continuing to see the Richelieus who often rang and invited me out.
                    But finally I received a telephone call from Marcel Leconte from the embassy who
                    was arranging my onward transportation and asking if I would mine taking a ship
                    from Marseille to Tangier as they had not been successful in obtaining a visa
                    through Spain for me. Of course I had no objections. I had been merely waiting
                    for somebody to do something about me.</p>
                <p>A little French friend of mine was able to get to Paris from her country place
                    and we had the day together before I left that evening at 8:00pm for Marseille.
                    In the afternoon we went to see a collection. I sat on the edge of a little gilt
                    chair fascinated by the beautiful manikins gracefully slink the length of the
                    ornate mirrored salon showing the latest creations. It was a gala affair like
                    the first night at the theater. To avoid ordering lobster again we had dinner at
                    our embassy restaurant and then Magde and Amy saw me off on the train to
                    Marseille.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>When I arrived the next morning I felt hot and disheveled for the train had been
                    terribly sooty, also I was slightly annoyed that I somehow missed the car that
                    had been sent for me from the consulate. So I taxied to the hotel where the
                    Paris embassy had made a reservation for me and said it was the best hotel
                    there. But, there was no hot water, terrible service, and it was frightfully
                    expensive. In fact, the prices were twice as high as they were in Paris.
                    Marseille seemed most depressing to me. All the men looked like thugs so I was
                    glad to reach the consulate where it was a pleasant surprise to discover the
                    consul was the son of Bouiseheart, who was one of the vice presidents of our
                    National City Bank. Charlie and I had entertained in Japan. Some of the girls in
                    the office kindly took me to lunch and in the afternoon suggested that I take
                    the boat ride over to the Chateau d'If where the story “Count of Monte Cristo”
                    was laid. He was supposed to have been in prison there with the man with the
                    iron mask.</p>
                <p>The next morning the consulate's car called to take me to the Koutoubia, the ship
                    that was to take me to my final destination, Tangier. A lower berth was assigned
                    to me, but when I saw the young girl in the upper berth above me with an injured
                    arm in a sling and knowing how difficult it would be for her to climb up and
                    down the ladder, I offered to exchange with her. The other bed was occupied by
                    an English woman who arrived with numerous small bags. It was amazing to see how
                    she managed to tuck them all neatly away in that tiny cabin. She was Miss Jessie
                    Green returning to Tangier where she spent a lot of time. It was not until I had
                    been in Tangier for a while that I learned that she was one of the three great
                    Green ladies. The other two were Ada, famous for her sheep and Miss Forieda, the
                    oldest, known for her wisdom. Jessie was the witty one. All three were
                    individual and original. Jessie was the eighth child of a Romanian mother whose
                    family had lost all of their money during the war. She said that she was called
                    Jessie after a horse because her mother ran out of girl names. She had first
                    come to Tangier at the age of seven on loan to her aunt, Lady Kirby Green, to
                    act as a companion to her only daughter, Forieda. Jessie had the strongest
                    personality of the three. Her energy was boundless, her eyes fearless and her
                    wit sometimes caustic. Forieda remained unmarried and devoted her life to good
                    works. As time went by she became more and more Muslim and completely at home in
                    their language. Although she had not visited her native England for over 50
                    years, she never gave up tea at 5. When Britain was being badly beaten on all
                    fronts during the war she received the OBE. Ada, her sister-in-law was entirely
                    different. She was tall, thin, elegantly dressed and smoked Russian cigarettes
                    incessantly through a long ivory holder. She had retired to Tangier after
                    spending most of her life in various parts of Africa where her husband had been
                    high commissioner.</p>
                <p>Soon I discovered aboard ship Mr. Edwin A. Plitt, who was to be the new minister
                    at the legation at Tangier, transferred from Bern, Switzerland. He was
                    accompanied by his pretty, petite French wife and a nineteen year old son who
                    was endowed with a sort of baronic good looks. We would often have pleasant
                    chats together on deck. Mr. Plitt impressed me as a kindly, mild mannered man in
                    his mid 50s.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The ship was crowded with refugees and we appeared to be the only Americans
                    aboard and the few English speaking people. I never saw such a fight for deck
                    chairs in so many different languages. We must have been on semi-war time
                    rations because only one cup of coffee was allowed at breakfast and one towel
                    per person for face, hands and bath for the entire two and a half day voyage.
                    French cuisine, but not at its best.</p>
                <p>One morning to my horror a rat ran into our room. It was eventually killed with a
                    broom by the steward. That was about the last straw. However, I felt lucky to be
                    aboard at all when Mr. Plitt told me it was sold out until 1948. He wondered how
                    I was able to get aboard. He said he had been pulling all kinds of wires to get
                    on. The Paris embassy could do nothing for him, nor could Tangier or Bern, he
                    finally had to go to the ministry of affairs. So I was most grateful for
                    anything after that.</p>
                <p>My deck chair, when I finally got one, fortunately was next to a very friendly
                    French woman and her crippled husband who was an architect. They were returning
                    to Marrakech where they lived at the Hotel. Madame (Inaudible) spoke excellent
                    English and was full of admiration for our American soldiers with whom she had
                    worked during the war. Her husband spoke no English but we managed brief chats
                    with my fractured French. His wife was very attractive and went into raptures
                    about Marrakech and the fabulous Mamauina Hotel. She also gave me sensible tips
                    on how to keep cool in a hot country.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Tangier on August 23, 1947 about sundown, four hours late after a
                    smooth trip through the Mediterranean following the coast of Spain most of the
                    way and passing very near the Rock of Gibraltar. Most of the legation's staff
                    were at the ship to greet their new minister and I met many of the officers and
                    their wives then. Especially do I remember Albert Sherer towering above all with
                    his attractive blond wife beside him. Mr. and Mrs. Plitt went down the gang
                    plank first, of course, and their son and I followed at a discreet distance.
                    There was a slip up about my hotel reservation at the Minsa, so David Frichlin,
                    first secretary and vice consul, and his lovely English wife, kindly drove me to
                    the Rif. It was directly on a superb sandy beach and I was delighted to be there
                    where some of the staff of the legation were staying. I had only been in my room
                    for a few minutes when the telephone rang and two of the girls invited me down
                    to their room for a chat and drink before dinner. So a warm welcome was extended
                    to me at once. Louise Broussard, who greeted me, was a vibrant personality with
                    radiant good looks. Never shall I forget how kind she was from the very first
                    moment. It was she who guided me through the complicated maze of narrow twisted
                    street for days so I wouldn't get lost. Showed me here and there the best shops
                    to patronize. She had been the secretary to Paul Alling, who had just left
                    Tangier to be our first ambassador to Pakistan and shortly after his arrival
                    there he sent for her to be his private secretary. She was absolutely
                    thrilled.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>After the girls briefed me a little on life in Tangier, we went into dinner
                    together and was served by a befezed and baggy panted Arab boy. His picturesque
                    native dress of a heavenly shade of blue with contrasting bright red cummerbund
                    was trimmed with intricate braid and it irresistibly caught my eye. And with
                    numerous tiny frogs down the front of the jacket, I vowed then and there to have
                    one made exactly like it. Later I did, but it was like a three ring circus
                    getting it made in three languages. My fatma translated the tribal tongue of the
                    native woman who was making it into French for my Swiss friend, Jacqueline
                    Cramer, who rendered it to me in English. There were only certain women who
                    could do this type of work and they were rare. When I passed through Tangier
                    several years later, this by then tattered garment to be copied, the concierge
                    of the Minsa said, “It would be most difficult to find someone now to copy
                    it.”</p>
                <p>That first night before retiring I stood on the balcony of my hotel and looked
                    upon this gleaming city of Tangier jutting out into the Straits of Gibraltar.
                    When the muezzin's call to prayer floated across the roof from the minarets I
                    knew I was in a completely Muslim country. All of the strange sights, and sounds
                    and smells fascinated me at once and I felt they would as long as I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>Ruth Emmet, who I was relieving, and who was in charge of the files started to
                    show me the work on Saturday morning. She was naturally anxious to be off to her
                    next post at the embassy in Ankara, Turkey and the legation had waited for me
                    for so long. Her great forte was her linguistic virtuosity which I admired very
                    much. The legation was the oldest in the history of our Foreign Service and
                    probably the most unique having been a gift from the Sultan in 1821. It was in
                    the old quarter of Tangier and divided by a tiny thoroughfare which we had to
                    cross to get from one office to another. We all quickly learned to flatten our
                    backs against the walls, sometimes with highly classified documents in our arms,
                    to allow the caravans of donkeys with their burden of faggots to pass, because
                    here the animals have the right of way. The residence for the minister was
                    upstairs above the offices. After a few days, Mr. Plitt moved his office
                    upstairs to one of the salons of the residence which was more fitting for him.
                    Then he kindly offered his office previously occupied by Mr. Alling to me which
                    I thought was a most kind gesture. Looking down upon me from the walls were
                    photographs of all the former representatives of our government to Tangier. It
                    was a big room with an old Moorish tile floor and I looked out upon an ancient
                    courtyard planted with flowering vines where a fountain played and little gold
                    fish swam. So I was very happy ensconced in my new environment with all of the
                    files to delve through and enjoyed the change of assignment—answering questions
                    now instead of asking them.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>There was a staff of about 35. The hours were from 9-1 and 4-7. Everyone usually
                    had their traditional siesta or went to the beach. The legation car transported
                    us back and forth from our homes to the office, but sometimes I enjoyed walking
                    through the old streets. All of the signs were in three languages—French,
                    Spanish and Arabic. When I wasn't working I was always exploring. There were
                    about eight Moors called shouse. The word is pronounced like a drunk saying
                    house. They were dressed in brown djellabas and red fez, ran errands and brought
                    us mint tea, that sticky sweet, aromatic oriental drink served in small rose
                    colored glasses fitted into brass holders arranged neatly on a brass tray that
                    would some times swing gaily. Being of the Berber tribe who sprang from the
                    white race, they took more kindly to European ideas than the Arabs. They had
                    light complexions, light eyes, clear cut features and a sense of humor. They
                    made devoted friends and faithful servants and sometimes served at our
                    parties.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I arrived, Betty Sullivan, a former colleague at the consulate in
                    Bermuda who had transferred to Rabat, the capital of Morocco where the Sultan
                    lives some 600 miles away, decided to come to Tangier over the Labor Day
                    weekend. I had not yet completely unpacked but was glad to see her. We did a lot
                    of sightseeing and she was an excellent amateur photographer. She took some
                    splendid photos of the narrow winding streets leading to the legation; where we
                    banked on Sundays; the Arab market square where the Berber women dressed in
                    their candy striped fontas half hidden under their enormous straw hats bright
                    with pompoms sell their goat skins, baskets scrawling in circles under the
                    trees; a cafe cluttered square at the foot of the Casbah; a fatamah was standing
                    at the entrance of an American's house in the Casbah swathed in her white robes
                    peering provocatively through the slit in her veiling; a view of the Bay of
                    Spain from the terrace from the Hotel Villa de France; a view of the hotel from
                    the Sultan's palace which is now a museum of arts and crafts; and finally the
                    much photographed house of Barbara Hutton in the Medina which she usually
                    occupied three months of the year beginning in June. The house was constructed
                    from what originally had been seven private dwellings and decorated by the
                    Honorable Maxwell, one of our government's earliest representatives in Tangier.
                    His daughter, Mrs. Hopwood and her husband, who was with British Council in
                    Tangier occupied it during the rest of the year.</p>
                <p>After Betty's visit I suddenly became very ill. Louise Broussard, who had the
                    room just across the hall, called the doctor, Dr. Harry Dunlap. He was a gentle,
                    kind Scotsman who took excellent care of me and was most faithful calling every
                    day of the two weeks I was in bed. It seems I had succumbed to the common
                    complaint so many new arrivals to North Africa get from germs in certain fruits
                    and vegetables and fish and from so much oil used in the cooking here.
                    Apparently few escape Tangier tummy. The ailment is the same depending on which
                    country you wish to blame it on. It goes by various names in different parts of
                    the world. It is Pharaoh's revenge in Egypt; and in Mexico, Montezuma's revenge;
                    Balkan Blight in southeastern Europe; and Turkey trots in Turkey. I was just
                    about to recover from the food poisoning when unfortunately I caught summer
                    influenza. My temperature soared to 102 degrees and I thought I would burn to a
                    crisp. I felt terribly limp with no appetite at all. The doctor admitted I had a
                    severe case.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>To be laid so low at the very outset of my assignment to Tangier made me feel
                    foolish and frustrated that this should have to happen to me now just when the
                    girl I was relieving was departing and so much to do. But luckily Ruth had shown
                    me all she could before she left and I had taken numerous notes. I was more than
                    grateful to be surrounded by so many good and thoughtful people. Mr. Plitt sent
                    kind notes with tins of fruit juice and his wife sent American butter and
                    offered to have her cook send anything I needed. Mrs. Goodyear, wife of the vice
                    consul, called, as did many others. The Demarquets who I had just managed to
                    look up before becoming ill were most attentive. Flowers were sent from the wife
                    of the manager of the Rif Hotel and the Spanish maids expressed their concern by
                    pantomime. In fact, the entire staff of the hotel couldn't have been more
                    solicitous.</p>
                <p>Mr. Plitt and Mr. Goodyear kept assuring me about work and not to worry. After
                    this illness I painstakingly pealed every grape. It took some time for me to
                    regain my strength. In the meantime the work had accumulated. There was no one
                    else who knew the files, they had to wait for me. Boxes were filled with
                    telegrams, incoming and outgoing, classified and unclassified, action and
                    information, and masses of mail to cope with. But everyone in the legation was
                    very patient and I was left alone to plod along and not pressed in the
                    slightest, so considerate and understanding were they all.</p>
                <p>Once back in the office I gradually became absorbed in the work. The code clerk,
                    Ruth Charles, was so security conscious and quite rightly, when she returned
                    from lunch one day and saw a bundle thrown in the wastebasket she immediately
                    picked it up with fright in her eyes and exclaimed, “Is this Top Secret?” I
                    couldn't help suppress a smile as I assured her it wasn't and explained that it
                    was a sandwich I had ordered at noon which had been made from a long hard loaf
                    of French bread cut into lengths with a thick slab of goat's cheese inside. I
                    couldn't get it in my mouth so I threw it in the wastebasket, failing to
                    classify it.</p>
                <p>Eventually my delving into the files revealed many things that interested me
                    enormously, historically and politically. Tangier had a varied history having
                    belonged to Spain, Portugal and England as well as Morocco. The Portuguese held
                    Tangier for 20 years and then it came into England's hands as part of Catherine
                    of Braganza's marriage portion when she married King Charles II in 1661. When I
                    was there Tangier was a free port and the international zone of Morocco. The
                    zone was run by the committee of control and legislative assembly. The committee
                    of control consisted of representatives of each of the big powers who were the
                    French, Spanish, and Italian ministers. The United States was not eligible as
                    she was accredited directly to the Sultan and Rabat, not having signed the
                    Treaty of Algeciras. Tangier had a reputation for wickedness, mystery and
                    romance and was said to be the world headquarters for smugglers, money changers,
                    blackmarketeers and spies. But most of this glamour was brought to an end when
                    Tangier gained its independence in 1956.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>In the process of my delving into the files, I became very interested in reading
                    about two of Morocco's most famous men—Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey, to give
                    him his full name and Abd el-Krim. General, later Marshal Lyautey, resident
                    general, had a record that was one of the most brilliant in history. His career
                    had already been notable for distinguished colonial service in India, China,
                    Madagascar, Algeria and on the frontier of Morocco. His talents were admirably
                    suited for dealing with Muslim people. He understood them perhaps better than
                    any other European has done and devoted himself to their interests. They in turn
                    gave him their affection and trust. He was a diplomat as well as a soldier and
                    sympathetic towards native life and thoughts. He found himself more at home in
                    the souks of Fez or in Marrakech than in the Champs Elysees and the Place de
                    Emperor. A lover of pageantry, he encouraged the renewal of the old world
                    ceremonies with all of their splendor. His subjects loved this display of pomp
                    and circumstance which had long been neglected by the previous rulers.</p>
                <p>Abd-el-Krim was another colorful character. He was one of the greatest leaders
                    the Riff had ever known.</p>
                <p>He rendered a service of the greatest possible importance to his country. He
                    suppressed the terrible custom of blood feud of tribe against tribe, family
                    against family and murders in the treacherous fashion committed during sacred
                    Muslim festivals. His scholastic knowledge and intellectual gifts marked him out
                    for advancement in a country where it is unusual to find anyone who can read and
                    write where risen to supreme power. Riffis referred to him as the “School
                    Master.”</p>
                <p>Carried away by success and ambition he dreamed of becoming Sultan of Morocco.
                    But Abd-el-Krim was a menace to the French and Spanish and his presence in the
                    Rif united these two countries as nothing else could have done.</p>
                <p>He finally surrendered to the French with dignity and composure and was treated
                    with kindness and exiled to the island of Reunion.</p>
                <p>We were all sorry to say goodbye to the Goodyears who left for Washington and
                    then to their new post at Zurich, Switzerland. A. Bolard More and his wife
                    arrived to replace them from the same place, Zurich.</p>
                <p>One afternoon David Fritzlan and his lovely English wife invited me to their
                    villa in the mountains near a section for Europeans that skirts the old city,
                    but once the hide-out for robbers. Nearby were the palace of the two former
                    Sultans.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>It was a very small select gathering. The other guests were Mrs. Anderson, who
                    was in charge of our legation's excellent library and also took care of protocol
                    matters. Her deceased Danish husband had been in his country's diplomatic
                    service and she had lived in Tangier for nearly 15 years. Other guests were the
                    young Polish Vice Consul and the French Vice Consul and his wife, who brought me
                    home and a Mr. and Mrs. Burgess. Mr. Burgess had been a former Governor in the
                    Sudan. It was a very pleasant afternoon and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</p>
                <p>Ruth Charles, my very security-conscious colleague, was due for home leave and
                    transfer soon. As she had never been to Fez she asked Mr. Plitt if she could
                    have a Legation car and driver to go there over the weekend and very kindly
                    asked me to go with</p>
                <p>her. Then we invited the newly arrived Mrs. Bolard More (Liz) to join us.</p>
                <p>We left at 10:30 on a Saturday morning with be-fezzed Mohammed at the wheel. It
                    was about an hour's drive through the Rif Mountains, to Fez, the center of
                    Morocco. A mountain fringed city behind high walls and most extraordinary in all
                    North Africa. It is said to be one of the three truly unique cities of the world
                    along with Peking and Venice. It had been populated by Arab refugees from
                    Cordoba, Spain, and has ever since been regarded as the spiritual heart of Islam
                    in Morocco. It is the religious, literary and scholastic capital of Muslim North
                    Africa with a Biblical flavor.</p>
                <p>The wealthy aristocracy flourished here and have great pride in their culture, in
                    their intelligence and in their manners. It was from Arabs that the Spaniards
                    derived the expression “My house is your house,” and the Arabs mean it.
                    Muhammadism is a religion of hospitality.</p>
                <p>Nothing in that old grey city seemed to have changed since the days of Mulai
                    Idris II who founded it in 928 AD. We spent a day immersed in the enchantment of
                    this 1,200 year old walled city where people lived in ways little changed for
                    ten centuries.</p>
                <p>Fez can be visited only on foot for its walls and watch towers enclose steep
                    twisting streets so narrow that no vehicle can penetrate the depths of the
                    native quarters. One enters only with a guide for it takes but a moment to get
                    lost and he will play the note of a ciceron in a brand of French you will be
                    lucky to understand.</p>
                <p>On either side of the reed-roofed, narrow streets, weavers sit cross-legged in
                    tiny cubicles weaving cloth into robes called Kaflans, embroidered wedding gowns
                    for Moroccan brides. The woodworkers are as nimble with their toes as with their
                    fingers. Artisans work endlessly, silently and skillfully on jewelry and brass
                    work.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>We had magical glimpses into the immense hall of the Karouiine Mosque where
                    hundreds of students and pilgrims crouch in perpetual prayer. It is the largest
                    in North Africa and remains one of the holiest spots in the Muslim world. There
                    is also the university where students stay as long as 15 years to become
                    professors and lawyers, who are the elite class who largely run the country.</p>
                <p>Near the old city is the enchanting Palais Jamai, an Arabian nights hostelry
                    built right into the east wall of the Medina. One of the finest and certainly
                    the most romantic in the world. The palace of a 17th century Grand Vizier, it
                    was modernized with infinite skill, retaining a compelling ambiance of both
                    worlds. The entrance looks almost squalid but inside terraced gardens and
                    jasmine were at every doorway and the green and blue tile work was
                    exquisite.</p>
                <p>A high ridge overlooks the north walls offering a superb vantage point for
                    viewing a serene mural of the whole city of Fez. Ancient forts line this hill
                    and travelers of the Merinid Sultans dominate the city they enriched when at the
                    height of their glory in the 14th century.</p>
                <p>As we left this land frozen into the Middle Ages by geography and customs, we
                    could hear the muezzin's call to prayer floating across the roof tops and watch
                    the snow capped Atlas mountains fade into the distance as in a dream.</p>
                <p>Soon after this little trip, the Plitts very kindly invited Ruth and me for
                    luncheon. Mrs. Plitt had all of the impeccable taste of the French and their
                    period pieces of furniture were beautiful. Mr. Plitt's dry humor made him very
                    appealing.</p>
                <p>In a few days Ruth was off for home leave and eventual transfer to Vienna. Then
                    came the news that Andy Andreus was transferred to Tunis as vice consul. This
                    meant that I could now definitely have an apartment in their building. It was a
                    wonderful stroke of luck because many were waiting for an apartment there. I
                    began to realize it was the choicest building in Tangier with a very obliging
                    Belgian proprietor, Mr. Neff. It was just up the hill from the Rif Hotel at 29
                    rue Grotius. I was so happy to have inherited from Ruth all this and her Fatma
                    too!</p>
                <p>I had a salon with a fireplace, dining room, kitchen with tiny balcony, two
                    bedrooms and a bathroom. French doors from the salon and from one of the
                    bedrooms opened onto a balcony where I had a lovely view of the sea. From here I
                    often watched the Arabs before sundown descend to their prayer mats, bow deeply
                    towards Mecca and hear them say their prayers. The beach was close by and the
                    lapping of the waves lulled me to sleep at night!</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Eventually I found a French teacher and began French lessons three times a week
                    after work. As she also taught bridge, it was not long before her husband and
                    the American wife of the Belgian proprietor, Mr. Neff, who lived upstairs joined
                    us for a bridge game played in French and we had great fun. Apropos of
                    languages, also learned the Charles V had said, “German should be used to
                    address animals, English to speak to merchants, Italian to make love, French for
                    diplomacy, and Spanish to pray to God!”</p>
                <p>Occasionally there were English speaking movies but not too good. One I saw was
                    “Arabian Nights.” As we were coming out of the theater, I noticed a great many
                    Arabs leaving and wondered what they thought of the Hollywood version of
                    themselves. The amateur dramatics directed by Albert Sherer and his talented
                    wife, were more entertaining.</p>
                <p>I had presented my letter of introduction from Mr. Jefferies in Bermuda to his
                    uncle M. David Jacquier of the French Bank, and occasionally lunched with him on
                    Sunday in his palatial villa right with mosaic tiles. He was a gracious,
                    dignified silver-haired gentleman who always had his nice nurse, Miss Stroyan in
                    attendance. Edward, his son, later came from England to look after his extensive
                    property and banking interests as his father was becoming rather elderly.</p>
                <p>One Christmas Day the Plitts invited the staff—35 in all—for luncheon. It was
                    then that I learned about the “protocol of the sofa,”—that it was not just a
                    piece of furniture for comfort but a symbol of rank! In veiled hints it was
                    conveyed that only the wife of the Minister had the privilege of sitting on it!
                    It had been a day when thoughts are certainly directed to our loved ones in
                    America so being with the Plitts and legation family was like a home from
                    home.</p>
                <p>After luncheon I cam home to rest a bit before going for Christmas dinner to
                    Francis Filliol's charming home on the Marson. It had been built onto an old
                    Moorish house and had a superb view of the ocean. Francis was a very good
                    looking Oxford educated Englishman with beautiful manners and a delightful sense
                    of humor. He had just brought his daughter of 11 and son, Chip of 9, back from
                    schools in England and they were little darlings. A very pleasant English woman
                    and family friend, Alice Sinfros was also invited.</p>
                <p>Jim Wiley, a most versatile Englishman, staying with Francis, made the delicious
                    Christmas pudding. He joined us at the table for an early dinner because of the
                    children to taste his pudding then had to go on to another engagement. Tucked
                    under the Christmas tree were gifts for all. And the bright shining faces of
                    those two adorable children lighted the heart.</p>
                <p>It was an unforgettable evening filled with real Christmas cheer. We were wrapped
                    in such a warm atmosphere that if you came without it, we certainly left with
                    it.</p>
                <p>Being in a Muslim country there had been little display of real Christmas spirit
                    here.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Over the holidays I invited for dinner Madame Sinoir and her husband who had just
                    arrived form Casablanca and a Frenchman to whom they introduced me, Andre
                    Triolet, an aristocrat with old-world charm. They seemed to have enjoyed
                    themselves very much and their Fatma did have a reputation for being a good
                    cook. The next day I received a bottle of cr�me-de-menthe liquor with Mr.
                    Triolet's card remembering that green was my favorite color. I was deeply
                    touched.</p>
                <p>One evening, soon after, I dined with the Sinoirs at the Minzah, where they were
                    staying and Mr. Triolet, who also stayed there, joined us for coffee with his
                    guest Baroness Fabvier who had recently returned from Paris. We discovered she
                    had an apartment just above mine so she very kindly brought me home in her car
                    and said she would introduce me to her son, Charles.</p>
                <p>The next day M. Triolet telephoned to say there was a special plane going to
                    Marrakech the following day for the holidays and asked if I would like to go. I
                    was thrilled, of course, because I had been longing to go there. But later the
                    trip was canceled by the airline. I was sorry. It would have been fun to go
                    while Churchill was there.</p>
                <p>About a month later while dining at the Villa de France with M. Triolet, he again
                    mentioned that plans were being made to fly to Marrakech. He once had a house
                    there, built by his friend M. Sinoir so knew the country well and was anxious to
                    show it all to me. But again, the flight was postponed due to high winds.
                    However, Madame Sinoir and M. Triolet and I all planned to be together the next
                    weekend... “Inshallah” as they say here. Never will they say, “I will do this or
                    that,” without saying “Inshallah,” meaning “if Allah is willing” or “this is the
                    will of God.” Not at all an empty phrase but a deep creed. Humility depends on
                    the will of God and the foundations of their character and behavior.</p>
                <p>So, the next weekend I was, at last, able to write to my family from
                    Marrakech!</p>
                <p>Mamauina Hotel, Marrakech, Morocco, Sunday, February 1, 1948.</p>
                <p>....I fairly held my breath all week, hoping and praying for good weather. It had
                    been rainy and windy up to the very day, Friday, I was to leave. But, thanks to
                    God, Friday was a glorious day—no wind and with a phenomenal stroke of luck the
                    plane took off in brilliant sunshine just a half hour late.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, aboard I found friends, the Assistant Naval Attach� and Mrs. Allen,
                    who were very helpful in seeing me through the usual French formalities. We flew
                    over the Sultan's palace in the gleaming white capital of Rabat, then we reached
                    Casablanca where the Allens got off. About an hour later Marrakech emerged and
                    deserved its fame—nestled in the midst of a palm garden backed by a magnificent
                    range of snow-covered mountains. The plane put down at 5:00pm and M. Triolet had
                    driven out to the airport to meet me.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Marrakech had a depth of charm I had never found anywhere else. If it could be
                    compared to any place I had been it would be Peking, because of its ancient
                    walls. The Mamauina Hotel was luxurious, rumored to be the most luxurious in al
                    of North Africa. It was in the old quarters but not of it. From the balcony of
                    my room I looked down upon the orange scented garden that surrounds the hotel
                    and in the distance the Atlas mountains rose high beyond the crenulated walls.
                    Tall cypress and date palms were situated against the sky and one or two almond
                    trees were just beginning to burst into bloom.</p>
                <p>The Koutoubia Mosque, built all by hand, 800 years ago, topped by golden balls,
                    loomed up from the native quarter. A copy is in Seville, Spain known as La
                    Giralda. Never have I seen such glorious coloring. The reflections of the sunset
                    on the snow covered mountains changed from a heavenly blue to a rosy pink.
                    Little lights flashed for just a few minutes in the minarets where muezzin
                    called his people to prayer an hour before sunset. Then flights of numerous
                    white egrets came to roost on the roofs.</p>
                <p>Above the old Koutoubia Mosque appeared the first evening star which twinkled a
                    long time before the myriads of others came out to join it. Later a warning rose
                    above the mosque and all through the night I could hear the monotonous rhythms
                    of the tom-tom far below in the native quarters.</p>
                <p>The next morning M. Triolet arranged for a guide to take us around. We went out
                    to the Palaisde la Babia, where Churchill had luncheon recently. I had my photo
                    snapped in the courtyard of a one-time harem and again in front of Bab Doukkala,
                    one of the great gates of Marrakech. Then on to see the Saadian tomb, burial
                    place of the 16th century Sultans, who came from Arabia to conquer Morocco and
                    stopped for a moment at Placeedu Syteebro where Marrakech surrendered to the
                    French.</p>
                <p>The celebrated Djemaa el F'na from earliest times had been a kind of perpetual
                    and fun fair, bursting with all the exhibitionist life that Africa can offer.
                    Always surrounded by a dense circle, including hundreds of solemn faced children
                    in hypnotized silence watching this spectacle of animation and colorful
                    turbulence. While his musicians attract the crowd a snake charmer coax a cobra
                    around his neck. To the intoxicating beat of tambourines, tall black men
                    descendants of Sudanese slaves, leap and twirl. The man shakes his brass bell
                    and a beggar, another leper, with fingers and toes chewed away by the disease,
                    reel off benedictions and moan for alms in a toneless voice. “May Allah help and
                    look after you.” During all this medieval entertainment, braying donkeys step
                    nimbly through the mass of people.</p>
                <p>When all other exotic sights and sounds threatened to batter my mind to a pulp, I
                    pleasantly escaped. For just six minutes by horse drawn carriage from the active
                    life I was back to the calm luxury of the magnificent Mamauina.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>After this extraordinary day it was very refreshing, a very pleasant surprise to
                    come to me room and find in a brass bowl, a large bouquet of violets on the
                    table. Mr. Triolet had asked the gardener to pick them for me from the garden,
                    place them in my room. His sweet thought touched me very much.</p>
                <p>The next day Madame Sinoir joined us in M. Triolet's little pony cart for a drive
                    out to the sultan's garden graves as old as the Bible. M. Triolet has a hobby of
                    breeding these little ponies in the south of France.</p>
                <p>Back at the Mamauina I was introduced to some of Mr. Triolet's delightful French
                    friends. They were all speaking of Churchill's recent visit when he would appear
                    on the steps leading down to the dining room in his “zoot suit,” the
                    extraordinary one-piece uniform he wore during the war and always with one of
                    his enormous cigars giving his characteristic wartime guest the “V”.</p>
                <p>I very much regretted that my time was so limited because M. Triolet said he
                    could have arranged with a very good friend of his to have dined with the Pasha
                    of Morocco, El Glaoui, sometime referred to as the most famous Moor in the
                    world. He is the most powerful man in Morocco, even more so than the Sultan
                    because he controls the Berber tribe. They say his table is unequaled. It would
                    have been an unusual experience but perhaps it can be arranged another time. The
                    air was dry and bracing and I could well understand why Churchill from England
                    and the storks from Holland fly here in the winter. I have written this while
                    relaxing among the flowers in the lovely garden of this fabulous hotel and
                    always wish for you when I am enjoying so many fascinating places. Photos will
                    follow. Love Virginia</p>
                <p>So at last I had been to the fabled city of Marrakech. I left there early Tuesday
                    morning and arrived home about 2:30pm. That evening I dined at Francis Fileo's.
                    The other guests were two interesting women and a representative of Coca Cola.
                    As someone said, “An American culture has come to Tangier when Coca Cola
                    arrived, a world wide symbol of American capitalism.” Next morning I fell to the
                    work that inevitably accumulates while gone, even for a few days. But I was
                    becoming enveloped by the spell of Morocco.</p>
                <p>A couple of months later in early March a memo from the military attach�'s office
                    announced that Captain Bedford was flying to Madrid and anyone having any reason
                    to go was to see Bolard Moore. I decided that I needed some visiting cards
                    engraved. How appropriate, I thought, were the last two lines of Edna St.
                    Vincent Millay's poem, “There isn't a plane, ship or train I wouldn't take no
                    matter where it's going.” But, when one first comes to a post one must travel
                    all the time. You have to see, to hear and to interpret it all for yourself. As
                    usual, this flight, too, was postponed several times. We finally took off on
                    March 8 at 9:00am with crossed fingers and a hasty prayer. So it was a beautiful
                    flight. We hadn't been in the air long when Seville appeared below on the left
                    and about an hour out of Tangier, Cordoba on our right.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>We arrived in Madrid about noon time. The weather was marvelous. There was quite
                    a gathering of embassy officials at the airport to meet the other passengers off
                    our plane, who had come to go on a hunting trip. Besides the pilot, Pete Bedford
                    and his wife, there were Captain and Mrs. Dudley and a Dr. and Mrs. Rideell from
                    Port Lyautey, the naval base that had just been taken over by the French, Elena
                    Rupert from the military attach�'s office and I came not to hunt, but to shop.
                    The naval attach�'s pilot from the embassy in Madrid drove seven of us to the
                    Lis Hotel where Elena and I shared a room. We paid 40 pesetas each for it. At
                    that time the dollar was worth 36 pesetas in Tangier. The hotel was small and
                    simple, but clean and modern. Located on a side street just off the main
                    avenida. Many Americans and the entire personnel of TWA stayed here. The
                    gracious manageress couldn't have been more courteous and friendly. On the way
                    to the hotel we had stopped at a place called The California where we had a real
                    milk shake and a sandwich made of real bread. Due to the flour shortage in
                    Tangier we had not been able to have decent bread.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards have a special kind sparkling conversation and appeal, rather a
                    temporary relief from hearing the Moors shouting to each other and the donkeys
                    braying. There were more lovely things than I saw in the shops in Paris, but
                    then Madrid had not been through so much. I bought one white and one black real
                    lace mantillas, beautiful tiles for a table and as they seemed so reasonable I
                    couldn't resist two crystal chandeliers which greatly enhanced my new apartment
                    with white candles. All were given lovely care by the personnel of the plane on
                    the return flight to Tangier.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>One morning Elena and I ordered breakfast early so we could be at the Prado
                    museum when it opened. Elena spoke Spanish so she was a wonderful person to be
                    with. The Prado was in an elegant royal house given to the Spanish people by
                    King Ferdinand VII in one of Madrid's loveliest area surrounded by the botanical
                    gardens. It impressed me very much to see the number of young artists who were
                    copying the old masters and so extremely well the paintings of Velazquez, court
                    painter from Seville and those of El Greco from Crete, renamed for his extended
                    figures with elongated fingers and slightly mad eyes. And also some paintings
                    from the flying collection of Goya who used such a variety of techniques in oil,
                    fresco, and tempura in Spain. The museum is well worthy of the devotion which
                    its many devotees regard it and I was to return many times to this priceless
                    little Prado, even for a few hours.Before M. Trealay flew to Paris he introduced
                    me to a French friend who came to tea one day, Madame Sabatier. She was driving
                    through Spain in early April to her small castle at Pau in the south of France,
                    and invited me to go with her. M. Trealay was to meet me in Biarritz and show me
                    the Basque country which I had heard was very interesting. Then I would fly back
                    to Tangier from Bordeaux. I thought it a lovely idea and at the end of March she
                    telegraphed from Paris: “Happy Easter. Marvelous weather. Do come via Biarritz.”
                    But alas I couldn't go. The inspectors from the State Department were due any
                    day to inspect the office, so, of course, I must not leave the legation. Jesse
                    Green, with whom I had shared a cabin on the Koutoubia coming to Tangier and Ada
                    Green, famous for her chic would frequently come for a game of bridge. Having
                    neither taste nor talent for a kitchen I let them brew their own tea. Being
                    British I knew they would prefer it that way and as they lived in the hotel
                    Minsa, they seemed to enjoy it.</p>
                <p>In the post one day came a book from Andre Trealay, “Le Cheval Blanc” written in
                    French and autographed by his former wife, Elsa Trealay. It had won the much
                    sought after Gonkure Literary prize of 1944. Her other books had been
                    illustrated by the painters, Marc Chagall and Picasso. Andre had told me he
                    often helped her with her writing, which showed characters full of humanity and
                    tenderness. She had been born into an intellectual Russian and Jewish family.
                    When Andre, then a young cavalry officer met her she had grown to hate the
                    anti-Semitic Tzarish regime. So he brought her out of Russia with him and they
                    were married. They had a happy honeymoon in Tahiti but marriage was not for
                    Andre so there was a divorce. In 1928, the Russian author, Vladimir Mayakovsky,
                    introduced Elsa in a left bank cafe to Lewis Aragon. He was recovering from an
                    unhappy affair with Nancy Cunard, daughter of the wealthy ship-owner and Lady
                    Cunard. He at first believed Elsa to be a Russian spy because of her penetrating
                    gaze. Later he wrote a book of poems entitled “Les Yeux d'Elsa.” She eventually
                    became the mistress of this celebrated French poet and theirs became one of the
                    most famous love affairs in France. She died in 1970 at the age of 74. A
                    collection of love tokens Aragon had given her each day toward the end of her
                    life was exhibited at Bibliotheque National. Several years later when I was in
                    Paris, I wanted to see this exhibition, but, of course, it was no longer
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>On Easter I attended early communion service at St. Andrew's Episcopal church.
                    The architecture of this church, consecrated in 1904, showed strong Moorish
                    influence in its square white towers, green tiled roof, beautifully painted
                    cedar wood of the chancellery ceiling, an arabesque in the recess behind the
                    altar. The inscription over the chancellery arch in flowing Arabic script is the
                    Lord's Prayer, and not, as many visitors think, a verse from the Koran, an
                    example of advanced ecumenism which may astonish them. In the afternoon I was
                    invited to tea at the Bonnets. They were a well known French family who had
                    lived for some years in a rambling two hundred year old house on the old
                    mountain road. There was a glittering gathering of guests of all nationalities.
                    The Duke of Trevare was there, one of the grandees of Spain. He and his sister
                    had brought me home one evening after a party our naval attach� had given at the
                    Rif Hotel when two cruisers were in port. I remember how impressed I was to see
                    how he, and his equally large sister, were both able to squeeze in their tiny
                    car and sit together. Among the English guests were Mrs. Drumward Hay, a friend
                    of Francis Fileo's; David Herbert, who was the second son of the Earl of
                    Pembroke and did, in fact, write a book entitled, “The Second Son,” which I read
                    several years later; Baron and Baroness Posch Post, and others were there whose
                    names floated away in the introductions. I think I must have been the only
                    American. A photo was taken of an unusual Moorish flower arrangement which was
                    to appear in the series Coca Cola published. Mr. Lakehurst was the pleasant
                    English representative in Tangier for Coca Cola. Both Clamonce and her sister
                    Madeleine were artistically inclined. Madeleine once brought me such a clever
                    flower arrangement. She had used gilded roses with jasmine in an old Moorish
                    Moroccan earthen ware bowl, which delighted me for years. Clamonce wrote poetry,
                    but she once told me she could never be inspired unless she had one white rose
                    on her desk.</p>
                <p>On April 5, 1948, at 11:45pm I wrote my sister Mildred: My last dinner guests
                    have just departed and I am hastening to write and tell you how happy I was to
                    have your telegram today. It was interesting to hear you were in New York
                    bringing back memories of our good times there together just a year ago. This
                    was really a beautiful birthday. I invited to dinner, Clamonce Bonnet, her
                    friend Jane Borden and Clamonce's sister from Brazil, Madeleine Colaco, who is
                    perfectly fascinating. M. Durand, a Frenchman, came bearing a lovely bouquet of
                    flowers, although he didn't know it was my birthday. These charming Frenchmen!
                    He spoke English without a trace of an accent, writes plays and poetry and very
                    artistic. Francis Fileo brought some rare specimens of roses from his lovely
                    garden, as he is a gifted gardener, and a bottle of Lanvin perfume from his dear
                    children. Andre Trealay sent me a case of champagne with a sweet message and
                    while at dinner a telegram of greetings arrived from him from Paris. Must get to
                    bed now. The military attach� is giving a party tomorrow evening at the Rif
                    Hotel, Army Day being the occasion. Couldn't retire without writing this note to
                    let you know how dear and thoughtful you had been and how touched I am by your
                    message and check. Love Virginia.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>We had a long weekend over Memorial Day so I decided to take advantage of it and
                    go to Casablanca aboard the Koutoubia. The ship had vastly improved since I
                    traveled in her to Tangier. Miss Afriat, one of the French Moroccan employees in
                    the library at the legation, whose home was in Casa was my pleasant companion.
                    Hotel rooms were at a premium there. The consulate in Casablanca had called all
                    the hotels and finally had to contact an agent to obtain a room for me at the
                    George Cinque, a hotel not as imposing as its name, but with the most obliging
                    manager. Miss Afriat showed me the shops the first day and took me to tea at the
                    Trianon where everyone goes for the delectable pastries. Estelle Kochan, who had
                    been at the legation in Tangier and such a friendly person, and now here at the
                    consulate invited me for lunch at the Oasis, which served delicious French
                    cuisine. Then we had a very pleasant carriage drive along the seaside.
                    Casablanca is wonderfully placed on the Atlantic and its long corniche is filled
                    with restaurants overlooking the beaches. We took tea at the Anfa Hotel, the
                    scene of the famous secret war time Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt,
                    Churchill and de Gaulle in January 1943 when they took over the entire hotel.
                    The American consul general had a lovely villa near Anfa in a residential suburb
                    once a pirate's lair. On Sunday I went out to Fedala, a beach I had heard would
                    be so attractive, but was frightfully disappointing. The manager, where I
                    lunched at the Miremar, was very pleasant, however, and a friend of Mr. Kneff,
                    proprietor of my apartment in Tangier. The most interesting thing to me was the
                    marker on the beach which described the allied landings there in 1942 when
                    Casablanca played a strategic role in the allied North African campaign.</p>
                <p>That evening I was very kindly invited to dine with friends of Jane Borden, the
                    Juliens, in their elegant apartment filled with exquisite French antiques. Mrs.
                    Julien was an American who had been spending three years writing a biography on
                    Sarah Bernhardt. Her husband, a French count, but didn't use his title, was the
                    son of the doctor to the sultan. Mrs. Julien showed me a lovely, delicate,
                    filigreed gold tiara the sultan had presented to her husband which she wanted to
                    sell. I thought Mrs. Julien had chosen an intriguing person to write about, for
                    Sarah Bernhardt's private life was as fabulous as the theatrical career,
                    stretching from the Second Empire to the roaring twenties. What I recalled was
                    that in 1880 she made her first trip to the United States for a 50 city tour. On
                    her return to France, 30,000 people hailed her on the dockside at Le Havre. In
                    1882 until her death in 1923, she created a new play in Paris every year between
                    tours. Her energy was limitless and even when she had her right leg amputated at
                    the age of 71, she continued to act propped up on a chair. And even in her dying
                    coma, it was said she recited lines from Racine's “Phedra”. The night she died,
                    the crowd cramming the streets outside her home was hushed as the doctor leaned
                    out of the window to give the news—Madame Sarah Bernhardt is dead. Thousands
                    attended her funeral and mourners queued for days afterwards at the cemetery for
                    a glimpse of her grave. On her tomb stone was inscribed just one word,
                    “Bernhardt.”</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>When I returned home a letter was waiting for me from Andre Trealay, who was in
                    Kenya. He wrote that the country was very green and had great charm and added a
                    humoresque note—you are requested not to frighten the tigers. He had planned to
                    go to Ethiopia looking for some land where he could build a place because he
                    always said he regretted giving up his handsome home in Marrakech. The never
                    ending water shortage reached tragic proportions. There was a murder in the
                    Casbah. As there is no water at all in the Moorish homes, the natives had to
                    queue up for it at their ancient fountain. One night so many people had gathered
                    around it that a child was pushed around so much by a man, she ran home and told
                    her family. Her father came and stabbed the man in the back. But sometimes
                    things get so tragic they get comical. A funny thing happened when several
                    people were sitting around chatting at one of the consul's homes. The door of
                    the kitchen had been left open when suddenly they all heard a slight trickle.
                    There was dead silence for a moment, and then everyone dashed out of the door
                    and ran home to take showers. Converse Hettinger, one of our new vice consuls
                    who always looked very impressive carrying a briefcase bulging with reports,
                    came in one morning and said, “Well, I had to brush my teeth with scotch this
                    morning.” Water was becoming more scarce than scotch. Once there was such a
                    waste my fatmah went away forgetting to turn off the taps and the salon was
                    flooded. My beautiful long draperies showed the water marks ever after.</p>
                <p>The dips in the sea were proving more pleasant than ever. One day I was invited
                    for a swim and luncheon with Jacque d'Marquet, to whom the Duke d'Richelieu had
                    given me a note of introduction, and his American wife, Phyllis, who had been a
                    school teacher in California. Their remote home on the Marsan was reached by
                    walking through a cemetery. The home had once been a harem and sat in about four
                    acres of luxurious foliage. Flowers were growing in riotous abandon and calla
                    lilies were everywhere. Seven wells were on the place and a charming legend was
                    that Circe was said to have once lived there, which gave an enchanting aura to
                    the place. The sprawling old house was like a museum filled with extraordinary
                    collections gathered from Jacque's travels, such as a rare Buddha, and shelves
                    lined with fascinating books. We descended for our swim to a secluded beach
                    where the ocean pounded against the rugged coastline. The water was nippy, but
                    delightfully invigorating. Then we lunched under a yellow fringed umbrella on
                    the terrace overlooking the sea. I was reluctant to leave, but had invited some
                    people in for cocktails so had to hurry home. One of my guests was an
                    interesting British chap, Gordon Evans, who had won the champion tennis singles
                    at Monte Carlo when he lived there several years ago.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>About this time a survey group arrived from the Department to investigate the job
                    situation. The idea was to classify all of the jobs and get them on a certain
                    salary level. The group started here and then went to Algeria and on to Cairo. I
                    enjoyed my interviews with Mrs. Beaton very much. All kinds of questions were
                    asked. Were you met upon arrival? Were you introduced to everyone and to people
                    in other missions? What are your living conditions? Did you choose the Foreign
                    Service as a career or come abroad for the glamour of it? Many girls expect to
                    find so much glamour in the job and often are bitterly disappointed. But she
                    said that she gathered from talking to me for a short time I had chosen it for a
                    career. True, but I was also finding glamour in it as I jogged along, I
                    confessed.</p>
                <p>Mr. Armstrong, head of our personnel division, and Miss Cullins, joined her a few
                    days later. As my fatmah made a good couscous I invited them for a Moorish
                    luncheon. One evening the Bolard Mores gave a cocktail party and Mr. Plitt sent
                    the official legation car, with all the flags flying, for Maggie Freed and me.
                    Mrs. Plitt was in the south of France visiting her family. Another proof of the
                    kind man he was.</p>
                <p>On the 4th of July there was a reception at the legation which is usually given
                    to celebrate our independence day. To attend is almost a sacred duty of every
                    American. At various parties I kept meeting Dr. Dunlap, who took such good care
                    of me when I was so ill, and his wife, everyone called Teddy. She was blond and
                    bubbly and a vice consul at the British legation. But, what I didn't know until
                    some years later, was that she had been a highly efficient member of their
                    Secret Service because she never appeared to take anything seriously. The
                    perfect spy. Dr. Dunlap was known to have worked incessantly for the poor
                    Moroccans, particularly the children.</p>
                <p>On the 11th there was a bull fight at the small Spanish frontier town, Le Lenia,
                    just outside Gibraltar. I had heard that one's first bull fight may seem a bit
                    blood curdling and thought I might find it too horrible, but felt I should try
                    to go to one while here. Six of us, the plane could only seat six, chartered a
                    plane to Gibraltar. We took off on a Sunday.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>...and from the legation Nancy Howard, Margaret Avent, and a new arrival, Mary
                    Williams, a sweet young girl from Vermont and George McGill from the military
                    attach�'s office. When we arrived we were taken to the Rock Hotel where rooms
                    had been engaged for the night. It was a delightful hotel built into the side of
                    the famous Rock. We had luncheon under a canopy in the terrace gardens and then
                    off to the bull fights. As seats were not reserved we had to go early to get a
                    place on the shady side. We were seated near the President's box and just
                    opposite the gate where the bulls and all the retinue matadors and picadors come
                    out. It was truly a magnificent spectacle for their costumes were handsome made
                    of brilliant colors. Only the matadors can be trimmed in shiny gold, and the
                    others who use the capes and bait the bulls were trimmed in silver. There were
                    in all seven bulls killed and we almost saw the finish in the moonlight. It is
                    appalling to see so much water being used to sprinkle the ring when we had
                    suffered so long from such a terrific shortage in Tangier. I had taken the book,
                    “Blood and Sand” with me and dipped into it at intervals which put me in the
                    proper mood while sipping sherry, the traditional drink I learned one always
                    takes to bull fights.</p>
                <p>One of the matadors must have said a very good prayer that morning because he
                    took some awful chances. He knelt on one knee and practically tickled the bull's
                    nose, then turned his back on the bull after a few passes to show his skill and
                    style. The first bull didn't have much fire in him, but they became bigger and
                    better as time went on. When there was an unusually good piece of work the
                    entire crowd cried in unison, “Ol�" One elegantly dressed Spanish woman threw a
                    rose. Lots of hats were thrown in the ring.I had to control myself from becoming
                    ill because it was horrifying to watch the blood stream down from the side of
                    the bull and then from its mouth and finally, when they drive the last spear in
                    his forehead, this is the moment of truth. This is the most difficult moment of
                    the Corrida and the bull is killed with a sword culminating a most important
                    factor of the grisly specter. It is killed instantly and falls over. Then the
                    man rushes up and stabs it again. The people all shout with great glee while
                    three decorated horses come out to drag the bull away. It is traditional to cut
                    off the bull's ear after the matador has succeeded in killing it, holding it up
                    to the President's box as a memento of his victory.</p>
                <p>The bull, more than once had the horses down. They were well padded so don't
                    believe any of them were badly gored. But it was simply sickening to see the men
                    beating, kicking, pulling the horse's tail and do everything in the cruelest
                    sort of way to get the horse up. After all of his trappings were off, one could
                    see how bony he was. Of course they only use animals that are that way, but
                    nevertheless they are still alive and torture to them and to the bulls was more
                    than I could possibly endure again.</p>
                <p>I appreciated, of course, the experience, of seeing one, for it is interesting,
                    but I certainly could not truthfully say I enjoyed it. It was simultaneously
                    impressive and repellent. The Spanish simply revel in it, but it was too savage
                    for me. They turn from God to gore with the greatest of care filling the
                    churches in the morning and the bull ring in the afternoon. Such are Sundays in
                    Spain where siestas become fiestas.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>After the bull fight we wandered through carnival crowds so dense we were afraid
                    to advance and unable to retreat. All sorts of booths were selling such cheap
                    souvenirs you would probably not know anyone you disliked enough to buy one for.
                    It was brilliantly lit for miles and refreshing to see so many pink cheeked
                    English boys and girls. At a rather picturesque restaurant we had ham and eggs,
                    the safest thing to order here. I didn't get into bed until 2:00am.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of July I gave a cocktail party for about 30 people. The entire
                    Bonnet family came with Jane Bordon and Maxwell Blake's first wife who lived
                    with them in their large rambling old home on the mountain. I also asked two
                    Englishmen I had met at their home, McDonald and Grisham, who were on assignment
                    for “Harper's Bazaar”. McDonald was writing about Barbara Hutton's home and
                    Grisham was doing the illustrations. It was to appear in the April issue. Robert
                    Maugham, Somerset Maugham's charming nephew, also came. When Mr. Plitt arrived
                    he rushed up to me and said, “Please do introduce me to your minister, I am
                    writing an article about him.” He then showed me some clippings from the New
                    York Times about himself and his new book recently published. Mrs. Plitt, just
                    back from visiting her family in the south of France, brought her sister and
                    child. The Marquets were also there, but Jacque couldn't eat or drink, he was
                    keeping Ramadan, the Muslim month of fast. With the start of the new moon in the
                    ninth month of the Muslim year, the holy month of Ramadan begins for the Arabs.
                    It is something like our Lent. For 30 days they cannot eat or drink anything
                    from sun up to sundown, not even a drink of water is taken during the daylight
                    hours. About a quarter to nine every evening, a boom of a canon signals the
                    Arabs to the food and drink that during the days they cannot touch and begins
                    the festive spirit that lasts until dawn. Beating drums, tom toms, and men
                    sing-songing the Koran and dancing until about 3:00am when the canon booms again
                    to signal to cease. It was then that I realized why the Duke de Richelieu said
                    Jacque was a “very peculiar man” when he gave me an introduction to him. He is
                    quite interesting but does have peculiar habits. It is just because he likes to
                    experience the customs and habits of the people in the country he is living in
                    and the Moroccan way of life is full of ancient traditions. So when the canon
                    boomed at sunset, he frantically asked for some water to drink. He couldn't wait
                    for the fatmah to bring him a glass, he dashed to the kitchen and swallowed a
                    whole pitcher of it. Phyllis, his wife, says he finds that most difficult of
                    all, to not drink all day. I thought he looked very gaunt and thin for the
                    experience. Fortunately, Ramadan will soon be over.</p>
                <p>After my cocktail party, the Benjamin Harrisons and my English friend, Gordon
                    Evans asked me to join them for dinner at the Villa de France. The food and
                    champagne was as delightful as the setting. We then went to the Emsalla Gardens
                    where we danced in the open air with the fragrance of orange blossoms from the
                    surrounding trees which were perfuming the air. It was a quarter to three when I
                    reached home. The precious water was just beginning to come on.</p>
                <p>The next day a box of delicious chocolates came with a card from Gordon saying,
                    “Many thanks for a wonderful evening.” So he too must have found the evening
                    enjoyable.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The Harrisons were later transferred to Honolulu. When I had admired an unusual
                    ring Gordon was wearing on his right little finger, he said he valued it very
                    much because it had been on Aaron Burr when he fought and won the duel with
                    Alexander Hamilton. His mother, whom he said he had buried in Philadelphia in
                    1929 was a Burr, descendent of this famous man. Having forgotten the details of
                    this historic episode, I looked it all up the next day in early American history
                    and it revealed among other things that he was said to be a man of great
                    interest, one of the most complex in the history of the young United States and
                    he had tremendous charm and fascination.</p>
                <p>Every year the British consul, Mr. Emose, invited all of the legation to a bull
                    fight party at his home in Ceuta, a little Spanish town of Moorish origin lying
                    on the narrow neck of the small peninsula just across the Straits of Gibraltar.
                    We filled nearly five cars and left about four in the afternoon arriving just in
                    time for the bull fight at 6:00pm. I never thought that I could possibly endure
                    another bull fight, but it made such a difference to sit next to some one such
                    as Mr. Abrines, a long time local from the legation who could explain the
                    technique as the spectacle progressed then becoming less emotional and looking
                    at it from the scientific side. Then I began to realize it is not a sport but an
                    ancient spectacle of art. Two of the bull fighters were the same we had seen at
                    the Leana. One young one was most daring and brave killing two bulls. When this
                    young chap killed his last, the whole place nearly went wild. Everyone stood up
                    and waved white handkerchiefs, a signal for him to have two ears of the bull, a
                    sign of merit. When he went all around the ring bowing he threw them up to
                    various friends in the audience. It was a much more emotional performance than
                    the one at Leana. But I still feel that it is cruel. Never would I become an
                    aficionada.</p>
                <p>The party afterwards was in Mr. Marce's large home beautifully situated beside
                    the sea. The garden was decorated with pretty Japanese lanterns and an orchestra
                    played while Spanish dancers performed. There were many uniformed officials
                    there and best of all we had the pleasure of meeting one of the bull fighters.
                    It had been a gay fiesta. About midnight we drove back to Tangier under the
                    purple velvet sky of Africa lit with millions of stars. In a few days I received
                    two photos from the bull fighter that I had met autographed “Manuel Alvarez
                    Andaluc.” I often wondered if he attained great fame. I didn't follow his career
                    because I never became an aficionada.</p>
                <p>One day Andre brought to my apartment a Polish countess and her attractive 15
                    year old daughter who had arrived here for a few weeks from Casablanca. Her name
                    was Strembosz. She had that intangible something that made one's heart go out to
                    her at once. We met again at Emsalla Gardens where Andre and I would often go to
                    enjoy the Vietnamese atmosphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The Carsons, he was our military attach�, gave an amusing party one evening at
                    the Balerno Beach Club. It was one of the nicest places to swim at the far end
                    of the beach. Invitations were sent out in rhyme and we were to come dressed as
                    we were at a certain hour of a certain day. Fortunately my invitation read,
                    11:00am on Sunday, when I was fairly decent in my bathing suit. But some were
                    invited as they were at 7:00am and most were still asleep. Bob Caldwell of our
                    legation came swathed in a sheet carrying a big fig leave from his own tree, I
                    suppose to be prepared for a slip of the costume. Nancy Howard, in her blue
                    pajamas, with cold cream on her face, walked in with her eyes closed. The
                    British consul, Mr. Gardner, had apparently been in the midst of shaving and
                    came in his dressing gown with just one side of his face lathered. There were
                    many others of the 60 guests amusedly dressed and undressed. We matched up
                    puzzles for dinner partners and I drew the Italian consul, Mr. Menti. He knew my
                    friend the Italian consul, Montenari, in Honolulu whom he said is now married to
                    an American and living in London. We sat with his wife and the others were all
                    French. The Baroness Bouveche, wife of the minister, M. Debroi, the Consul and
                    M. de Furst, the military attach�, who brought me home. The water was so warm
                    many went for a swim about midnight. As I had on my suit, I dipped in too. It
                    was a smashing party.</p>
                <p>M. Durand called one day to say that he had an artist friend from Paris he would
                    like to introduce. My first day free was Monday when we met at Portos where
                    everyone goes for tea. M. Courbin was a delightful young man and began to
                    quietly sketch my portrait under the table. Then we came to my apartment where
                    he continued and he showed me some of his work. He then asked me to come to the
                    Casbah. The French government had given him a studio in one of the Sultan's
                    palaces, now a museum. When he finished it he hoped I would permit him to show
                    it in his exhibition he was having in Paris in October. He and M. Durand went on
                    to Rabat where he did some Moorish types. When they returned I invited an
                    artistic gathering of friends in to see his work and my portrait he had done. A
                    chaouch from the legation, who served at parties, made some mint juleps,
                    although not exactly like my brother-in-law from Kentucky made them. But they
                    looked artistic with a few sprays of jasmine on the tray. A Moorish version of a
                    Kentucky mint julep.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The Countess Strembosz came looking enchanting in an exquisite ice blue satin
                    gown designed to show off her superb figure and baring a box of Port's delicious
                    chocolates. I thought a beautiful subject for a portrait at that very moment.
                    The other day she mentioned that she was going to ask the Caid if he could
                    arrange to have a diffa, typical Moorish feast for me. But he explained he had
                    been ill. She was to return to Casablanca the next day and invited me to visit
                    her. The Kneffs also knew her so came down from their apartment to join us.
                    After she had returned to Casablanca she sent me a perfectly lovely hand
                    embroidered blouse and a pair of gloves. Andre told me later that she would like
                    to come to Paris to live but as she is a Polish �migr� in exile there is
                    something difficult about it. Andre and I dined at the Minsa afterwards. They
                    were now serving on the cool terrace with gay green clothes on their tables,
                    little flags and lights strung along the balcony and the orchestra playing
                    behind potted plants with a view of the harbor beyond. We were blissfully
                    ensconced at our table for two. It was a happy evening. Andre combined artistic
                    manners with democratic opinions and was so knowledgeable about everything, I
                    just listened to him completely enraptured.</p>
                <p>One day soon after he introduced me to the Russian Countess Ignatieff, who was
                    tall, slender and highly intelligent. I invited her with Andre, Robert Gilmore,
                    who had formerly been Naval attach� at our legation, for luncheon one day. The
                    conversation was so scintillating they stayed on until after 8:00 in the
                    evening. I will always remember Gilly saying he thought the greatest thing in a
                    woman was ton dress.</p>
                <p>On a Sunday in mid September, M. Durand drove Andre and me with a picnic lunch in
                    his jeep to the little town Xauen (Chausen). The road curled through the Rif
                    mountains covered in pink laurel and crossed rushing streams. This former city
                    of mystery climbs up a side of a gorge and is like an amphitheater built into
                    towering rocks by those Moors expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella.
                    Regarded in the Muslim world as a sacred place, it was a hidden city closed to
                    non-Muslim where no Christian foot had ever trod until 1920 when the Spaniards
                    marched in. The houses in this little wall town have red tiles, sloping roofs,
                    just as in Granada. A quiet sleepy place where the Moroccan traditions, customs
                    and ways are most perfectly preserved. Some small orphan girls sit cross-legged
                    before high string looms, weaving rugs. Wordless women go veiled through the
                    narrow streets. Silence is broken only by the clip clop of the donkeys jogging
                    along.</p>
                <p>After we left Xauen, we drove on to Tetuan, former capital of the southern area
                    which was a distance of about 33 miles. The population is almost entirely
                    Berber. The nail studded and artistically decorated doorways fascinated M.
                    Durand and he drew many little sketches, took countless photographs. Later, when
                    he built a home in the Casbah he used some of these designs. The city is white
                    spiked with green minarets. We came in along the ancient walls surrounding by
                    the dwells and one wonders if he is in Morocco or Andalucia, Spain. The houses
                    with that shiny blue tiles called azulejos are occupied by many families bearing
                    such names as Rodriguez, Torres, and Fernandes and still hold keys to their
                    houses in Granada although it has been about 500 years since Isabella and
                    Ferdinand reconquered the city from the Moors.</p>

                <p>The Spanish language is the language of officialdom, banks, shops and hotels. But
                    Arabic is the tongue in the market places and tiny shops. The monetary unit is
                    the Spanish peseta, so you may savor Spain without actually visiting it. We
                    strolled through the complicated maze of blind alleys, arched lanes and dark
                    streets and picked our way gingerly over the slippery stones, jumping hastily
                    aside when a hoarse voice shouted “balak,” warning approach of a donkey with
                    loaded panniers on its back. It was a most rewarding loop through the country,
                    this drive through Spanish Morocco. Pierre Loti, the French writer, with 14
                    celebrated travelers did it in 1889 and noted it in his book “Au Maroc.”</p>
                <p>One evening Andre invited me to dinner with his friend Madame Sabatier. who had
                    been visiting her handsome son, Count de Lessups and his wife, a ravishing
                    English beauty. They came for a baktil shortly after when I also invited the
                    White Russian Countess Ignatieff and her mother and father and some other
                    friends. The young Countess de Lessups had an aura of romanticism about her
                    which was captivating. I was later invited to Madam Sabatier's where I met the
                    wives of the British and Belgian ministers.</p>
                <p>October 7, I received a cable from Charlie Biddle which touched me especially
                    after all these years — Greetings on our anniversary about this time. The date
                    of our marriage was actually October 11, 1930 in Kobe, Japan. Even though our
                    marriage collapsed, our affection for each other remained unaltered.</p>
                <p>A recent addition to our legation staff was George E. Palmer, a ruddy, robust,
                    bright eyed vice consul transferred here from Kabul, Afghanistan, where his
                    father was ambassador. They have the unique position in the Foreign Service of
                    being the only father and son serving together at the same post.</p>
                <p>Our electricity had been cut to such an extent that for three consecutive days
                    and nights we had none at all in the apartment. Everyone had to make huge
                    investments in candles. Working under feeble lights until 7:00pm at the office
                    and trying to do urgent work by candle light began to be irksome to us all.</p>
                <p>Over Armistice Day weekend, I had a very interesting 4 day trip. M. Chamaway,
                    another of Andre's French friends, had a beautiful cabriolet car and asked Andre
                    to accompany him through the south of Morocco as he had so much knowledge about
                    the country. And I was so pleased to be invited to go along. Andre said I must
                    see the far south of Morocco before I left. Travel is an opiate stranger than we
                    know.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>We left about 10:30 on Thursday morning and followed the long span of Rif
                    mountains that led south to Rabat which we reached about 5:30pm. Betty Sullivan,
                    my erstwhile colleague in Bermuda, now posted in Rabat greeted us at the hotel
                    when we arrived. She then took me around in her jeep she had traded on an
                    emerald she had bought at her last post, Bogota. The Arabic sign on it read,
                    “Allah will protect us,” so I felt safe in this country where the word of the
                    prophet is strictly obeyed.</p>
                <p>Rabat is a handsome, scrupulously clean gleaming white city blessed with a
                    magnificent location on dramatic cliffs above open sea. It is the old
                    administrative capital of Morocco where the resident general lives and acts as
                    minister of affairs for the Sultan, who was then His Majesty Sidi Mohammed Ben
                    Mouli Ussef, about 36 years old. He died on February 26, 1961. One of the sights
                    to see every Friday was the Sultan, lover of pageantry, who had ruled the
                    country from the 16th century, mounted on his palomino charger proceeding in
                    state to the mosque. Pavilioned under the royal umbrella, escorted by the Black
                    Guard and preceded by spearmen, while his subjects cry: “May God preserve the
                    life of our Lord”</p>
                <p>Hassam Tower, strange minaret of the 13th century mosque. It was built by the
                    great Sultan El Mansour who subdued north Spain and built three of the finest
                    examples of Moorish architecture in each of his three capitals—the Giraldo in
                    Seville, the Koutoubia in Marrakech and here in Rabat the never finished Hassam
                    Tower.</p>
                <p>From the minaret, the grandson of the great Sultan Youssef-el Mansour preached a
                    holy war facing a fanatical audience of 200,000 persons against an invader of
                    Islam's sanctity. The invader was none other than St. Louis of France soon to
                    die of the pest in Carthage. It was lovely to see all this in a glowing
                    sunset.</p>
                <p>We then walked through terraced courtyards of date palms and roses to a Moorish
                    cafe overlooking the river Bouregreg where we sat and sipped sprigged mint tea
                    as the last rays of the sun faded away. Betty then showed me through the
                    consulate and we had a cocktail in her apartment just beneath the office.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The next morning I rejoined Andre and M. Chamaway to drive on to Marrakech. The
                    roads were excellent and the weather was wonderful. Andre kept up an incessant
                    stream of conversation in French explaining every little detail of the land he
                    loved and knew so well. There is truly a mystic in Morocco. As Edith Wharton
                    wrote in her book “In Morocco,” “The present is a perpetual prolonged past.”
                    Painters were particularly susceptible, including Delacroix and Matisse. Most of
                    Matisse's Moroccan paintings of 1912 and 1913 are in Moscow as they were bought
                    by his friends. In 1832, Delacroix made sketches and noted in his journal, “the
                    mountains are in the softest possible tones, the sea a dark blue green, the
                    color of a fig.” The camels plodded steadily by the roadside, also on the way to
                    Marrakech, a clearing house for the camel caravans. Shortly, the blue shadow of
                    the Atlas Mountains crept upon the horizon and the desert began. The first
                    oasis, the seductive one, was Marrakech. Again, I was back in this exotic and
                    romantic spot. This time I had a glimpse of Andre's house he always so regretted
                    selling in a rash moment. We leaned over a mud wall and there it was in the
                    distance on the edge of the desert set in a garden on the outskirts of Marrakech
                    looking very much like a luxurious old English manor house. It was definitely
                    his house, but alas, no longer his home. Owning a house somewhere always cements
                    an interest in the place.</p>
                <p>From Marrakech the glorious road led across the snow capped great Atlas range and
                    dropped down into the Sous valley. We drove through Tuareg, the land of the wild
                    blue men, to Taroudant,, midway from Marrakech to Agadir, and lunched here at a
                    little hotel hidden behind high walls that had a charm all its own. It was set
                    in a garden where we could hear the tingling of the ever present fountain in the
                    old Moorish tiled courtyard. The blue men are still a mystery and distinct from
                    all others in Africa. The women's faces are tattooed with blue arabesques and
                    their eyes outlined with kohl. In the world of the blue men, the women had the
                    upper hand. They danced a weird kind of dance. The women putting fingers to lips
                    uttered shrilled cries that sound like “youuuuuuu youuuuuuu,” a strange birdlike
                    howling noise they always produced to celebrate great occasions.</p>
                <p>Agadir resembled more of a California resort having the same latitude as San
                    Diego than most of the other Moroccan cities I had seen. It had a magnificent
                    white sandy beach and the swimming here was safe. Many Atlantic beaches are not.
                    When we were there, it was the winter coastal resort of Morocco, a perfect place
                    to relax and starting point for excursions into the deep south of Morocco. But
                    on leap year day in 1960, Agadir was tragically, completely destroyed by an
                    earthquake.</p>
                <p>We drove on to Mogador another seaside resort where all of the buildings were
                    painted white with a beautiful deep blue trim on shutters and doors, the
                    symbolic color the Arabs believe keep away evil spirits. Then back to Marrakech
                    for the night at the marvelous Mamauina. I arose with the sun the next morning
                    to take an early flight for Tangier in order to be back at work on Monday, for I
                    WAS working, I wasn't traveling.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>When I returned to the legation I was greeted with the good news that I had
                    received a promotion, an increase in salary, an outcome of the survey group's
                    visit in July. I was still aglow with the news when Andre took me to luncheon at
                    M. George Clinchant's, who had an apartment in my building. He was elderly and
                    old worldish with a great Gaelic wit and had formerly been a French ambassador.
                    The other guests were his very good friend Madame Fabvrer who still showed the
                    elegance of her earlier years, and her tall handsome bachelor son who lived in
                    the building, Charles. Mr. and Mrs. Kneff, the genial Belgian proprietor of our
                    building was also there.</p>
                <p>George McGill had also invited me for luncheon that day as he was entertaining
                    the well-known newspaper man, O'Rourke. It would have been interesting to have
                    met him and sorry not to have been able to go.</p>
                <p>On November 20, I received a letter from my family enclosing a Christmas check
                    with message to take a trip somewhere over the holidays. With the check in hand
                    I think where to go. I decide to leave on a Wednesday morning by train for
                    Meknes. From there interesting trips could be taken to Moulay Idriss, an old
                    Moorish city built in memory of the saint where no European is allowed to stay
                    the night. And not far from here was another walled city, Volubilis, where there
                    were some interesting Roman ruins. The next day planned to motor to Ifrane, a
                    picturesque mountain resort for winter sports. The following day to Fez where
                    the best tooled leather can be had. I hoped to be back on Monday the 27th. By
                    then I felt I would have seen most of Morocco.</p>
                <p>In Meknes, which is almost in the center of Morocco, I stayed at the
                    Transatlantic, a French hotel on a hill with a superb view of the Arab town.
                    That afternoon took a “couchie” (which is horse and carriage) to see the town.
                    Meknes is a city of Moulay Ismail for whom many streets and boulevards in
                    Morocco are named. Like most Moorish sultans he had an absolute passion for
                    building. A great admirer of Louis XIV, his greatest ambition was to create an
                    African Versailles. With this object in view, Roman remains at Volubilis were
                    dragged to the capital and thousands of Christian slaves worked incessantly to
                    add court to court and pavilion to pavilion. But now it was reduced to massive
                    and imposing ruins. Only the palatial remnants of this 18th century palace can
                    be seen, once the ambition of a Moorish potentate who died in 1727. What is
                    better preserved is Bab El Mansour, one of the most beautiful 18th century gates
                    in Morocco. The city is proud of a large ostrich farm where these birds have
                    been raised for centuries. Some were actually sent to Louis XIV by the sultan on
                    the occasion of modestly demanding the hand of the French princess. But
                    apparently the ostriches only amused the ladies of the court.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The next day I had an early start by car for the Roman city Volubilis and the
                    Islamic city of Moulay Idriss, the greatest architectural dramas which lie side
                    by side between Meknes and Fez. Volubilis means morning glory. In 217 AD it was
                    a city of 15 thousand with houses of beautiful mosaic floors, columned Paris
                    styles and had a triumphant arch built in honor of Caliph lacalla, but today it
                    rises from a sea of flowers and storks' nests on the broken pediments. In
                    contrast to Volubilis, the sainted city of Moulay Idriss gleamed with green
                    tiled mosques and is second only to Mecca in Islamic sanctity and forbidden to
                    non-Muslims except for brief visits when an official guide leads visitors
                    through the maze of century old streets and requires a good bit of donkey
                    dodging. People here are, as in all Morocco, were timid, smiling and polite. It
                    was sweet to hear the little henna haired girls and long robed Arab boys greet
                    strangers with “Bonjour Madame.”</p>
                <p>Then Andre arrived to spend Christmas with me. We first went to have some of
                    Meknes's famous meringues and later walked through a lovely old Moorish garden.
                    The following day we took a car to Fez, just an hour's drive away. The leather
                    work was exceptionally fine here so I had a large white leather frame made for a
                    photo of my deceased brother-in-law. On the 24th we drove up to Ifrane where we
                    expected to find snow, but though they had it the day before, it had melted by
                    the time we got there. Instead it pelted rain. I had planned on getting an arm
                    full of holly but was content to be given a few sprigs by the keeper of the inn
                    where we lunched. We celebrated Christmas with a delicious dinner in that
                    romantic hotel of exquisite blue and green tiles, the Palais Jamai. On Sunday I
                    returned by train to Tangier so grateful for the generous check my family had
                    been so dear and thoughtful to send me which enabled me to have such a memorable
                    Christmas holiday.</p>
                <p>Just about this time a very pleasant person, Virginia Robinson, came to share my
                    desk. She had been traveling for over a year in fascinating places doing a
                    special assignment for the Department in the way of map collecting. From here
                    she was going to Timbuktu where there was no hotel so she stays in the
                    hospital.</p>
                <p>On April 1 we all had to fill in transfer cards. I didn't know at what post I
                    would rather be assigned, so I just put down first choice Tangier, second
                    Florence, third Istanbul. Transfers are usual made at the time of home leave and
                    one is usually on tender hooks wondering where the next post will be. In fact, a
                    propos of this, a clever poem written by a secretary serving at the consulate at
                    Adana, Turkey who wished to remain anonymous:</p>
                <p>Oh, where in the world am I going next, where?</p>
                <p>Oh, where in the world am I going?</p>
                <p>Oh, where in the world will I be</p>
                <p>when the years at the middle?</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Oh, answer this riddle.</p>
                <p>Oh, where in the world will I be?</p>
                <p>Am I going to London or Ghana?</p>
                <p>Am I going to Ouagadougou?</p>
                <p>Am I going to Spain where it rains on the plain?</p>
                <p>Will my language be Czech or Urdu?</p>
                <p>Will I bask in the sun in December,</p>
                <p>Wear long johns in June and July?</p>
                <p>Will I swim in the Niger, play tag with a</p>
                <p>tiger or maybe fly kites with a Thai?</p>
                <p>And will I wear mumus or saris or fur lined parkas and boots?</p>
                <p>Will I cook with fish and rice or curries and spice</p>
                <p>or will I chew beetlenut roots?</p>
                <p>Oh, where in the world am I going</p>
                <p>When I leave fair Adana behind?</p>
                <p>When I bid thee goodbye, Oh where will I fly?</p>
                <p>Please, you are driving me out of my mine.</p>
                <p>Maggie Freed is being transferred to Ankara, Turkey. Nancy Howard may be
                    transferred to Nairobi as someone in the Department wrote to ask if she would
                    object going there. Probably because the Stookeys had written wild letters about
                    hyenas coming up to their front door, being eaten alive by white ants and
                    hearing the cries of the wild animals at night.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I was perfectly delighted one day when a letter came from Clay Merrill who had
                    launched me in the Foreign Service by giving me a job in consulate Bermuda for
                    which I have been eternally gratefully, saying that he had been transferred to
                    Gibraltar and expected to be there with his wife, Jane, in late June.</p>
                <p>Andre had brought so many of his French friends to my apartment that one evening
                    he came with Madame Yvonne St. Leger and introduced her as the only French woman
                    he had ever known with any charm. She was not only charming, but as delicate and
                    lovely as the pink rose bud she wore in the lapel of her chic grey suit. I just
                    stood at the door in mute admiration. Our friendship which continued until the
                    day of her death many years later stemmed from that very first moment.</p>
                <p>The daily rounds of duty that by now had become routine continued at the office.
                    Then, one day news circulated that the legation plane was going to Rome on June
                    10th. These occasional trips were one of the fringe benefits of being posted in
                    Tangier and I was not one to ignore the opportunity whenever it presented
                    itself. Who was it said, “Three things come not back to man or woman—A sped
                    arrow, a spoken world and a lost opportunity” ?</p>
                <p>As soon as the plane landed at Rome, I dashed up to Florence. As many do, I
                    dearly love Florence. To those fortunate enough to have traveled in foreign
                    countries there is an ever present lively nostalgia to revisit beloved places.
                    In this city of Dante and Giotto I began to seek out my old haunts. I walked
                    along the lazy Lung Arno and strolled across the Ponte Vecchio browsing in tiny
                    jewelry shops that flanked both sides of this picturesque bridge, the oldest in
                    Florence. Then dropped into the Grand Hotel and it looked even grander than when
                    my sister and I stayed there several years ago. Florentines are proud that Via
                    Tornabuoni is acknowledged to be one of the greatest shopping thoroughfares in
                    the world. It was on that street that I found my favorite pension, Tornabuoni
                    Beacci, an old fashion establishment where one can stay in passed grandeur very
                    inexpensively. On this street is the Palazzo Strozzi that Byron said was the
                    greatest sight in Florence. But for me, the greatest sight in Florence was the
                    Duomo Campanile and Baptistery all in a group in Piazza del Duomo. The Duomo is
                    artfully fashioned from stripes of black and white marble. At the dawn of the
                    new architectural era, 1400, the Giotto Campanile is still a miracle of beauty
                    after six centuries of existence. The perfect grace of its proportions and the
                    loveliness of its graceried windows make it marvelously light and elegant. When
                    Giotto died in 1337 he was buried in the church at a corner nearest his
                    Campanile. His baptistery is the most conspicuous monument of any age because of
                    its celebrated bronze doors which occupied Ghiberti for 27 years. Each
                    represents various events from the Old Testament. It was Michelangelo who it is
                    said stood in silence for hours regarding every detail of this marvel in bronze.
                    Then walking away as if in a trance said, “It is worthy to be called the Gate to
                    Paradise.”</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>After absorbing all of this beauty I sat down at an outdoor cafe and sipped a
                    cool drink while watching that leisurely old world go by. The next morning I was
                    up early to take the 8:25 bus back to Rome via Siena where we stopped for
                    several hours. Although much too much to see in that brief time, fortunately
                    there was a very informative American woman on the bus, a Miss Pickney, from
                    Charlestown, Virginia, who had lived there for a while and kindly took me at
                    once to see the most important places. On the ancient gate Porta Camalin was a
                    welcome written in Latin legend, “Siena opens her heart still wider to thee.”
                    Siena has preserved its medieval character to a greater extent then most other
                    places in Italy. Strange to say as their fortunes fell, the arts flourished to
                    unimaginable heights. Her famous school of painting was renown for
                    individuality. The Sienese demanded of their painters art that was the handmaid
                    of religion. The first great name in Sienese art was Duccio who painted with
                    religious ecstasy. His subjects were full of tender beauty and sentiment. It was
                    enough just to feast my eyes on these in the short time I was there.</p>
                <p>As we drove along the countryside seemed so green, restful and peaceful. The
                    Italians have a sense of the picturesque and the dramatic, always perching their
                    towns on top of a mountain which gives a beautiful silhouette to the
                    countryside. We stopped briefly at a little hotel, the Milano, in the tiny
                    village of Aquapied where Princess Margaret had stayed and signed her name,
                    which they had framed—Margaret, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland—and dated
                    just to the month we were there.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Rome about 8:00pm and I was taken to the Hassler Hotel perched at
                    the top of the Spanish Steps. There I had a lovely room and bath for about $4.
                    As the shops were beginning to close, I rushed out to make a few purchases and
                    to look up Nancy Howard and Margaret Avent at their hotel, the Majestic where
                    they stayed for about a $1.75 and had excellent service. We went along to the
                    Cafe Gleco, which I had read about in “Vogue” and where all the artists
                    gathered. It certainly did have atmosphere. A long haired artist was writing at
                    a nearby table and frantically picking his teeth at the same time.</p>
                <p>We decided to go to a little bistro around the corner for pizzas and then parted
                    at the Hassler. The hotel was to call me at 7:00 the next morning but forgot and
                    I was still sound asleep at 8:00. So I flew around to get ready and left without
                    breakfast as we were to take off at 9:30. I was certainly glad when coffee was
                    served on the plane. The French say coffee should be black as night, strong as
                    love and hot as hell. Just what I needed! Everyone compared notes on what they
                    had done. Nancy...</p>
                <p>The others spent their time trying out all the Italian dishes in various
                    restaurants and dancing. I much preferred the way I spent my time, but made it
                    more eager now to return. There is such a wealth of art and beauty there to
                    absorb. We were delayed at Algiers with a bit of engine trouble, but arrived in
                    Tangier about 6:00pm.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The moment I walked into my apartment I knew Andre was back in Tangier, for in a
                    vase were red carnations he often sent with a message asking me to dine with him
                    that evening at the Minsa. He was very enthusiastic about a place he had
                    discovered on the coast of Spain, Marbella. It was being developed by Prince
                    Alfonso de Hohenlohe and managed by Count Rudolph von Schoenburg. He gave them
                    some excellent suggestions in the beginning which they very much appreciated and
                    in turn were most kind to him when he finally spent his declining years there.
                    Every year in May I paid him a little visit.</p>
                <p>Mr. Seate, our administrative officer, telephoned me to ask if I could take off
                    at 7:00 the next morning for Port Lyautey, the naval base about two hours from
                    here where we have medical examinations. But as my Spanish visa had expired I
                    was unable to go. However, I went with a group later. The staff is obliged to go
                    there regularly, a rather strict examination. The commissary and PX are also
                    there so we can make some purchases before returning.</p>
                <p>One afternoon Margaret Avent and I were invited to tea at the home of the Duke of
                    Trevare and his sister. We sat in a conservatory type room surrounded by tall,
                    19th century plants, pleasantly chatting over tea in an old world ambiance. It
                    was getting really warm now. On these summer Sundays, Andre and I with picnic
                    lunch would be up in the hills walking or down at the beach swimming.</p>
                <p>On July 8, 1949, an airgram from the Department arrived assigning new appointment
                    Mary G. Kenney as advance replacement for Virginia Biddle who will be
                    transferred via US for statutory leave shortly after obtaining eligibility. At
                    last I could begin to make definite plans for home leave. I wrote to my sister
                    hoping she could come for a visit before I left. A few days later the Plitts
                    returned from their leave in the States and the moment I saw them, Mrs. Plitt
                    exclaimed, “Your sweet sister entertained us in your lovely apartment in
                    Georgetown and plans to come out.” Then Mr. Plitt added, “I told her to get her
                    passport ready.” “ Anyway,” he smiled and said, “I hope they don't transfer
                    you.” A tactful diplomatic remarks, perhaps, but characteristic of his kind
                    feelings for others.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The entire staff of the legation were again invited by Mr. Emose, the British
                    consul, to the annual party and bull fight in Ceuta. This time it was rumored
                    that the only woman bullfighter in the world may be there, so it should be
                    immensely exciting.At last I was given permission to take the diplomatic pouch
                    to Gibraltar. One of the officers had been going over with it every other week
                    and some time ago I asked if I could take it because I was anxious to see the
                    Merrills. But the powers to be were not certain if a female could act as a
                    courier. I was quite excited about the little mission and looking forward to
                    seeing my dear friends the Merrills recently transferred there. The plane would
                    take off about 8:00 in the morning and bring me back about 7:00 in the evening.
                    After mission completed I could poke around shops. There are practically no
                    sidewalks there so pedestrians take to the road and stroll along main street the
                    city's principal thoroughfare. Smiling Lebanese and Indian silk merchants lounge
                    outside their long, narrow shops enticing you to come in. Gibraltar is like a
                    Western world Hong Kong. The merchandise is virtually free of all duty and
                    taxes. A pleasant British colony atmosphere is found everywhere. Spain claims
                    Gib and wants it returned, but Britain has emphasized it will not transfer
                    sovereignty over it without the consent of its 30,000 people.</p>
                <p>It was August 11 that I flew over with the pouch and had a most delightful day.
                    Both Mr. and Mrs. Merrill greeted me with open arms and hugs and kisses. We
                    lunched at the Yacht Club and reminisced about Bermuda and brought me up to date
                    on all the latest news. Mrs. Merrill had set her enormous energy to renovating
                    the official residence there from top to bottom. She had ordered bamboo
                    furniture and the drawing room was to be all in white. It sounded cool and
                    lovely, and I knew with her taste it would be perfectly decorated. They turned
                    their car and chauffeur over to me for the afternoon, then walked all the way
                    out to the plane where we embraced again and looked forward to seeing each other
                    in Tangier. Mrs. Merrill planned to come over to order some rugs.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Tangier I received a letter from my sister telling me of the
                    very pleasant trip she had on the Presidential yacht with the Trumans and had
                    the honor of sitting between the President and Dean Acheson at luncheon.</p>
                <p>Andre planed to leave end of August for the Balearic islands. He wanted to get to
                    Majorca before the Fomentur Hotel closed and then he was going to the south of
                    France and said he would meet my sister in Paris.</p>
                <p>My replacement, Mary Kenney, arrived the end of August. I met her with a bouquet
                    of flowers at her hotel, the Rif, and began to show her the files shortly after.
                    She displayed an enormous amount of self-assurance and rode full gallop into her
                    new assignment. One day I was invited for lunch with Baron Gresigny and his
                    wife. She had been in a haute couture and so very kindly gave me some notes of
                    introduction to some of the fashion houses in Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I had waited so long for my travel orders I began to think they had been lost in
                    the tangle of red tape. Then one day the long looked for official news
                    arrived—Tangier, Pasadena, California via the Department. Not returning Tangier.
                    Should loose pack effects. Webb. When the telegram came to me for filing, Mr.
                    Plitt had written a note on it—sorry to see you go—which made my eyes mist with
                    tears because I think he meant it. My sister Mildred came shortly after for a
                    brief visit and joined me on my return to the States. The night she arrived we
                    had dinner at the Parade. It was a garden/restaurant bar operated by two genial
                    Americans, Jay Hazelwood and Bill Chase, and had become the popular rendezvous
                    of the foreign colony. We chatted like magpies over the delicious seafood
                    specialty.</p>
                <p>Then the days became crowded with various activities. The Merrills invited us
                    over to Gib one day and it was such fun having a picnic lunch with them in a
                    cork forest. We were also interested in the progress Mrs. Merrill had made
                    decorating the residence, as Mildred too had a flare in that direction. While I
                    dismantled my apartment and Argeti came to pack up, Mildred took a trip to Fez
                    and Marrakech bringing back treasures even long time residents had never seen
                    before. But then she always did have an eye for the unusual and would use them
                    in the most intriguing way in her apartment.</p>
                <p>A hundred invitations were sent out for a cocktail party I was having which was
                    sort of a “hail Mildred, farewell Virginia” affair. A few days before the party
                    I heard Mildred going into peals of laugher. When I went to see why, she was
                    leaning over the window watching a little donkey deliver all the liquor that it
                    had carried on its back. A usual sight in Tangier, but not in Washington,
                    DC.</p>
                <p>There appeared this account in the Tangier Gazette, dated October 14, 1949. “The
                    American Minister, Mr. Edwin A. Plitt and Mr. Bolard Moore, American Consul and
                    his wife, were amongst the 100 guests that thronged the lovely apartment of Mrs.
                    Virginia Hamill Biddle on Sunday evening last. Mrs. Biddle is shortly leaving to
                    return to Washington, DC. Her masses of friends and American consulate
                    colleagues will miss Virginia who has resided here for 2 and a half years and,
                    so she says, has been very happy. Good luck to you Mrs. Biddle, and thank you
                    for the lovely party.”</p>
                <p>The last night we spent at the Minsa Hotel. When my devoted and faithful fatmah
                    came to bid me goodbye, we both wept. Her little veil was damp with tears when
                    we parted. It had always been hard for me to break the threads that attached my
                    heart to such people.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Mildred and I flew to Paris and stayed a few days at the Louiemont. It was good
                    to see Andre again and we enjoyed lunching with him at Druonce a favorite place
                    for the intelligentsia of Paris. Then, for some strange reason, we decided to go
                    to Holland, an unwise choice at this time of year. It was bitterly cold and so
                    windy we were nearly blown off the Island of Volendam into the canal. But we
                    liked Amsterdam and the trips on the canal in those wonderfully wide sightseeing
                    boats. In Brussels we stayed at the Metropole where I particularly enjoyed the
                    beautiful music played during dinner. Brugge, “the bridge” in Flemish, was
                    enchanting with the white swans floating on the canal, lined with stately 15th
                    century patrician homes and dominated by the great belfry. Gent, so near, was
                    the gothic city of mellowed brick towers, spires and churches and abbeys,
                    castles and convents. In Delft I bought some lovely old blue delft tiles.</p>
                <p>On November 7, I sailed from the British port of Southampton in the America for
                    the States. Mildred flew home as she held a return plane ticket. When I reported
                    to the Department for my next assignment, I was offered either London or Paris.
                    Having the climate upper most in my thoughts, I chose Paris. But that proved
                    ironic for it rained as much there as it did in London. But to quote Edna St.
                    Vincent Millay, “How shall I know unless I go to Cairo or Cathay whether or not
                    this blessed spot is blessed in every way?”</p>
                <p>While in Washington, a long time friend, Betty Purdy, asked me to stay a few days
                    with her. She was very social and she and her husband took me to several
                    cocktail parties. At one I had the pleasure of meeting the Duchess of Windsor's
                    well loved Aunt Bessie, Mrs. D. Buchanan Mellinman. She was very friendly and we
                    chatted together most amicably for quite a while. Then Betty gave a beautiful
                    party. The Times Herald, Washington, DC, December 8, 1949, had a nice account of
                    it.</p>
                <p>“Mr. and Mrs. James Howard Purdy, Jr. were hosts at a cocktail/buffet supper at
                    their home last evening. The Purdy's gay gathering was in honor of Mrs. Paul
                    Healey and Mrs. Hamill Biddle, both Washington visitors. Among the guests was
                    George Livingston Williams. Both honored guests are also Paris-minded for a
                    while.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Healey often sojourns there and Mrs. Biddle will sail for La Belle France on
                    January 23. The latter returned last week from 2 years at the US legation in
                    Tangier, Morocco and her next assignment is to be the American embassy in Paris.
                    Widely traveled in the orient as well as Europe, blue-eyed Mrs. Biddle went with
                    the State Department in 1946 and finds it fascinating. Prior to going to Tangier
                    she was at the consulate in Hamilton, Bermuda.”</p>
                <p>Then my sister and I went out to California to spend the holidays with my father
                    and brother, Harold. We had such a happy reunion, and perhaps it was well that
                    we did not all realize then that it would be the last Christmas the four of us
                    would ever be together.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>After we returned to Washington, Mrs. Truman invited Mildred and me to have tea
                    with her at Blair House, just the three of us. At this time the White House was
                    undergoing extensive restoration, so the Trumans moved across the street to the
                    official residence for visitors, and stayed there until November, 1948 to March,
                    1952. Quite apart from its present use, it has historical significance. We had a
                    pleasant little visit over tea with Mrs. Truman and as we were standing by the
                    door saying goodbye she asked me how I was going to Paris. I replied that I had
                    been booked on the Ile de France and so happy to be given passage in that
                    elegant French liner. But she quickly said, “Oh, I just heard she is not
                    sailing.” My heart sank with such sudden disappointment that I didn't even hear
                    her if she did say the reason why.</p>
                <p>When we reached my sister's apartment the telephone was ringing. It was the
                    Department of State calling. The voice confirmed just what Mrs. Truman had said
                    only five minutes before and asked, “Now, would you like to fly or to take the
                    next available ship, the George Washington?” As I was already packed for steamer
                    travel and preferred sea voyages, I immediately said, “I will take the George
                    Washington.” What a mistake that was. I, of course, could not know until I was
                    aboard that she was still in the striped condition of a transport. No luxurious
                    lounges or cabins and no bells in the cabin. Meals were served at long tables as
                    in an army mess. I remember three others sharing my cabin. One woman must have
                    been a returning war refugee for she was filling a suitcase full of oranges she
                    brought from the dining room after every meal. There was such a gale blowing
                    when we were to dock the ship rammed into the pier and split a hole in her side.
                    No one I know of was injured, but I feared the publicity of the accident in the
                    United States press would worry my family. It had been a melancholy trip and a
                    miserable crossing. It was not an enjoyable experience. But I suppose life is
                    not always meant to be enjoyed but sometimes endured.</p>
                <p>It was February when I arrived in Paris, grey, damp and drizzly. My room at the
                    Louiemont, where reservations were made for me, was cold, but I was reluctant to
                    move because there was something about the shabby charm of the place that
                    appealed to me. I liked the friendly staff, the cherry chambermaid, Marie
                    Louise, and the little chubby cherub faced, beribboned war veteran who ran the
                    lift so dexterously with his one arm, and even the sad eyed but obliging
                    concierge. And it was so convenient to the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>At first I was temporarily assigned to USIS, United States Information Service,
                    known in State Department jargon as the long arm of the embassy, where my
                    immediate supervisor was Anita Lauve. The offices were then in the annex. It was
                    just a short stroll up the Champs Elysees from our embassy and only cobblestones
                    away from the Elysees Palace and the British embassy. An American Baroness
                    Pontalba from Louisiana, then a French colony, had it built in 1842 and it was
                    called the Porta La Belle Hotel. Her architect, Ludwig Visconti also constructed
                    Napoleon's Tomb. In 1876 Edmond de Rothschild bought the house and added a glass
                    canopy which was considered the dernier cry of architectural fashion at that
                    time. He died in 1934 when his son, Maurice, moved in, but only shortly. During
                    the Nazi occupation it housed the Luftwaffe Club, and after the Liberation, the
                    British Forces Club until 1948 when it was bought by our United States
                    government. The offices retained a certain by-gone grandeur which I like. But I
                    was not to be there long.</p>
                <p>My assignment was to be in charge of the files under Miss Agnes Snyder in the
                    passport division of the consular section of the embassy. Miss Snyder, who had
                    once studied to be an opera singer, was a handsome woman with aquiline features
                    and always beautifully coiffed grayish white, and sometimes blue, hair. She was
                    a vibrant and vivid person no one ever forgot, and well known for being a hard
                    taskmaster and the perfect classroom was the passport section. But she often
                    displayed a very generous nature, especially at Christmas giving us all lovely
                    little treasures found in the flea market she haunted on holidays.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>In due time the note of introduction, South Trimble, Jr., my sister's
                    brother-in-law, had given me was presented to his friend, David Bruce, who was
                    then ambassador at the embassy. Within a few days an invitation was received to
                    a reception at the embassy's residence, then at No. 2 Place Iena. As the Bruces
                    were both collectors, the residence was beautifully furnished with choice pieces
                    arranged with distinction. David Kirkpatrick Este Bruce was tall, silvered
                    haired and distinguished. He greeted me graciously and asked about South. I
                    replied that he was indeed very well. We both agreed what a highly regarded and
                    fine man he was, especially for his fine legal matter, so much so that all who
                    knew him, even those who did not, were stunned and shocked when he became an
                    innocent victim of the violent crime wave in Washington on New Year's Eve in
                    1974. When I mentioned to the ambassador how pleased I was to be assigned to the
                    embassy he smiled and in his soft southern accent said, “Well, just let me know
                    if anything goes wrong.” He had a reputation of always being very considerate of
                    his staff. Many of his friends compared him to Thomas Jefferson, one of his own
                    heroes. His wide knowledge ranged from fine wines to 18th century antiques to
                    history and international politics. The man most young diplomats cared to
                    resemble. He became one of the most outstanding diplomats of our country. And as
                    everyone knows, the only one who eventually ever handled the so-called triple
                    crown to the prestige posts of France, Germany and Great Britain. His wife,
                    Evangeline Bruce, was tall, slender, willowy and chic. She was dressed in black
                    that evening with a long rope of pearls tied in a knot. She had a delicate oval
                    face, amber eyes, a cloud of luxurious chestnut hair. Everyone was struck by her
                    beauty. When a child in China where her father was a Foreign Service officer in
                    Peking, she could have been one of the beauties of the tale of the Ganges. She
                    was erudite and elegant and so punctilious that her friends said they felt her
                    thank you notes were written as she drove away from their functions in the
                    car.</p>
                <p>Peeking out from under the buffet table were their lovable floppy eared and sole
                    eyed spaniels who played an enormous part in their lives. Their children, Sasha
                    and David, appeared with their nanny, meticulously dressed in French and English
                    clothes. Looking then at that lovely little child, Sasha, who but God would know
                    that while still in her twenties she would chose to end her own earthly life in
                    1976. Tish Baldridge, the social secretary to Mrs. Bruce was here and there
                    introducing and chatting with guests. It had been a pleasant occasion and I
                    enjoyed myself very much.</p>
                <p>Jacque de Marquet. a French born, naturalized American, to whom the Duke de
                    Richelieu had given me a note when I was assigned to Tangier, had just returned
                    to Paris from his lecture tour in Belgium and invited me to a concert one Sunday
                    afternoon. It was held in a small, two-hundred year old concert hall where our
                    seats were just above where Napoleon sat. Chopin and Liszt used to play here and
                    the acoustics were said to be marvelous. Before M. de Marquet returned to
                    Tangier, we went out to Neuilly for lunch and again for dinner. He was very fond
                    of Neuilly.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>At long last my effects arrived. They had presumably been held up by strikes.
                    Argeti who packed them in Tangier was so concerned he wanted me to let him know
                    at once and in what condition they were. So I spent my weekend unpacking and
                    getting settled. Of the apartments I had seen, none seemed satisfactory. Strikes
                    occurred frequently, especially in winter, to complicate the transportation
                    situation. As the Louiemont was just behind the embassy, I could be at my desk
                    in five minutes without being confronted with the problem. Not being skillful
                    with the skillet, I was not eager for domesticity. In every corner of Paris
                    there were tucked away numerous small restaurants which were fun to explore.
                    Eventually I joined a club on Rue du Faubourg Saint Honor� where I frequently
                    had meals. I found it a pleasant place to entertain friends. Or there was always
                    the American embassy restaurant to go to when funds were low. Therefore, I
                    decided to stay at the Louiemont. When arranged with a few pieces of my
                    furniture, my small coca cola ice box tucked under a dressing table in the
                    bathroom, became a boom. Antoine from the valet would bring up a hunk of ice for
                    it about twice a week and in the hot weather and the bedroom became a little
                    salon. I kept cool drinks and tin things in the ice box and planted some drawf
                    ivy to grow over the old wrought iron balustrade and I was quite happy there for
                    my entire duty in Paris, for four years.</p>
                <p>Margaret McCollough, who I had known in Bermuda, invited me to visit her at Monte
                    Carlo over the Easter holidays. I was to stay at her hotel, the Monte Carlo
                    Palace and we were to take an excursion from there to Nice, Cannes and ancient
                    Aires. I was very much looking forward to the trip and the pleasure of seeing
                    her again. Margaret and her friend, Gladys von Hessenstein, met me upon arrival
                    which happened to be my birthday, April 5. My room looked out over a lovely park
                    with the famous casino beyond and had been made gay with fruit, flowers and
                    birthday gifts. After lunch we took a bus to Nice which has the supreme
                    advantage of being able to go anywhere from it by any route on 101 agreeable and
                    delightful excursions. At Cannes I was interested to learn it had been
                    discovered by an Englishman, Lord Erdman, who gave his name to a carriage. He
                    fell in love with the place, lived there for 30 years and there he sleeps for
                    all eternity.</p>
                <p>We arrived back to Monte Carlo in time to quickly change for the champagne dinner
                    I gave to celebrate my birthday. Margaret had tickets for a Monte Carlo ballet
                    afterwards. The next day we drove to Menton, the peaceful town on the border of
                    Italy. Here it seems the curve of the coast is gentler and the colors of the
                    landscape softer than elsewhere. It has long been a favorite resort for the
                    English escaping the rigors of winter and Queen Victoria pointed the way.</p>
                <p>Another day we drove up into the thyme scented hills behind Monaco to see the
                    impressive trophy of Latrube, the allegorical statues. This memorial intended to
                    endure for all time, was a hundred years afterwards destroyed by wars that
                    raged. Aires was an astonishing little village on a rocky pinnacle rising up to
                    the void. It presented a picture of silent desolation amidst the chaotic
                    mountains. The Prince of Sweden had his home here with his mistress during the
                    war.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>On Easter Sunday we went to the Principality of Monaco. A tiny kingdom enclosed
                    by mountains in a theatrical setting. It was like a scene from a Gilbert and
                    Sullivan opera. Moored in a little port below were palatial yachts. A whole
                    forest of masts rose out of the quay. Sentries were like toy soldiers dressed in
                    their colorful uniforms with white and red feathers coming out of shiny helmets
                    glistening in the sun. Flags were flying everywhere for Prince Rainier, the 31st
                    ruler of Monaco with 142 titles, was to have his coronation the following week.
                    Margaret, who had lived there with her husband before the war, knew the Aide to
                    the Prince so was invited to his reception. The event of 1956 was his marriage
                    to Grace Kelly, one of the most glittering stars in the Hollywood firmament. The
                    general atmosphere of Monte Carlo was one of great refinement and elegance. It
                    is considered the neatest and cleanest city in Europe and appealed to me more
                    than any other place on the Riviera. It was pleasant to have a lazy aperitif on
                    the flowery terrace of the casino, listen to the music and recall the days when
                    foreign visitors wore crown jewels instead of cameras.</p>
                <p>The next morning I rose at 5:00 to catch an early train back to Paris. Through
                    sleepy eyes I watched through the window the Province landscape unfolding. The
                    countryside was a blaze with apple blossoms in full bloom and there were lovely
                    stretches of pine forests and groves of twisted, silver gray olive trees that
                    Renoir loved to paint. Perched on the heights in the distance were visages of
                    old forts and crumbling ramparts. I dozed, and when I woke it was midnight and
                    we were in Paris. It had been a glorious Easter and a very happy birthday with
                    delightful friends who had done so much to give me an unforgettable glimpse of
                    the French Riviera.</p>
                <p>When I was back at my desk in the embassy, shortly after this trip, a cousin of
                    my brother-in-law dropped in to see me, General Edgar Hume. His name had been
                    legend in the family for a long time. One of his chief claims to fame was the
                    fact that he had heroically rescued the famous works of art in Italy and hid
                    them during the war. In our brief chat I mentioned how much Mildred enjoyed
                    going to President Truman's inaugural ball with him and how much I had enjoyed
                    reading his article on Italy in the National Geographic. And he informed me that
                    he was having another article in the same magazine. That night he left for Japan
                    and by coincidence via Monte Carlo.</p>
                <p>Jacqueline Cramer, my Swiss friend, suddenly appeared in Paris with her daughter
                    one day. Over a drink at the Crillon, she invited me to visit her at her home at
                    Celigny on Lake Geneva when we have a holiday the end of May.</p>
                <p>In early May I received a letter from Andre Trealay asking if I would like to
                    join him at Biarritz. He was going there to attend a pony fair. But I sent word
                    that I could not come before my next holiday, the 18th. So he telegraphed that
                    he would wait there until then. He wanted me to see the coast along Biarritz
                    which he said he preferred to the Riviera.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>When the date arrived, he met my train at Dax and showed me where the parents of
                    the pony he was giving me were breed. In a pretty meadow under water where some
                    horses were grazing. He, himself, had the slim figure of a fine horseman and
                    rode on horses whose pedigrees were as undoubted as his own. We lunched together
                    in a quiet rustic inn on the regional dishes of the country. The pate was made
                    on the place. He saw the goose killed. I learned a lot about the pate that comes
                    from France and is a luxury item in America. The delicious duck, also from the
                    same place, was a cross between a wild and tame one. This was followed by pound
                    cake topped with strawberries and served with champagne. Voltaire called it a
                    civilizing drink and said it reflected the brilliant soul of France. Someone
                    once said that gastronomical dining of the past was one of the few pleasures
                    left in modern life.</p>
                <p>After lunch we drove to Bayonne where we entered the Basque country. It</p>
                <p>had a wonderful 13th century cathedral. Was the city of the English and French
                    queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine and known for its chocolates, ham and bull fights.
                    Then a little passed Bayonne, was Biarritz. It was the fashionable spa of the
                    19th century made famous by Empress Eugenie, Queen Victoria and Edward VII, and
                    still retains the baroque atmosphere of the second empire.</p>
                <p>After a few miles down the coast, we came to St. Jean de Luz. Here was the true
                    Basque. A fishing village, peaceful, picturesque and languorous that had
                    retained all of its Basque characters, the strange baffling language and simple
                    local pleasures. They had their own cuisine, paella, and their own sports,
                    palota, played by the world's best players including priests. Louis XIV and
                    Marie Theresa of Spain were married here.</p>
                <p>An old friend, Robert Gillmore, we affectionately call Gilly, had a villa near
                    and invited us to luncheon. I loved watching the waves constantly breaking over
                    the rocks of the scenic coast line and felt fresh and exhilarated by the sea
                    breeze. Now I could understand why Andre preferred all this to the Riviera.</p>
                <p>In a recent edition of the New York Herald, I noticed a photo of Mrs. John
                    Hubbard, nee Helen von Stadt, with whom I had met and became friends with on
                    board a ship to Tahiti. She was being decorated by the French consul in New York
                    with the highest honor of the French government. She had told me that she had
                    been made Commodore, having already received the Legion de Merit, then the
                    rosette. Only one other woman in America received the same honor. It was a
                    tribute for devoting so much to the restoration of Moi Maison. My French friend,
                    Yvonne St. Leger, drove me out there one Saturday afternoon. I so enjoyed seeing
                    all Mrs. Hubbard had so generously contributed towards this charming and
                    historical place.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The work at the embassy was becoming terrific. When the war in Korea first
                    started, the newspaper bannered alarming headlines. People were coming each day
                    to inquire what to do. One day, Mrs. Woolf, whom I had met on the Mauritania,
                    came in quite upset. I explained that we had received no instructions from the
                    Department and finally calmed her over lunch at Rumplemeyer's. For about ten
                    days during this episode I was just quickly having a coke and sandwich at noon
                    and rushing back to the office and staying until 8:00 at night. Fortunately, it
                    all eventually subsided.</p>
                <p>On the Fourth of July, the ambassador gave his usual reception in the gardens of
                    the lovely old mansion at 41 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honor�, originally bought for
                    use by the ambassador but now used by USIS. Anyone who could present an American
                    passport could come, so there were masses of people. We were asked not to bother
                    to shake hands with the Bruces as they would have so many hands outside the
                    family to shake, so we didn't. The Converse Hettingers had just been transferred
                    to Paris from Tangier so we went together. A steady stream marched up to shake
                    hands, warmly beam and march to a long buffet table where the food is waiting
                    and enormous trays of alcoholic beverages. Only hats are seen on this occasion
                    as it is too crowded to show off a dress or suit.</p>
                <p>Although I was very much enjoying my work at the embassy, it had become
                    exhausting during the hot summer months when so many people come to Paris. A
                    quiet get away from it all holiday in a cool spot was all I wanted at that
                    moment. So over Bastille Day, July 14, weekend, I went to Fontainebleau. As many
                    officers were given training here during the First World War, I thought my
                    brother Harold may have been here. So I wrote him from the grand hotel, the
                    Aigle Noir, where I stayed. Here I am able to enjoy the miraculous and
                    marvelously healing attractions of the country. Robert Lewis Stevenson has left
                    us one of the most moving tributes to Fontainebleau in the English language—”The
                    vigorous forest air, the silence, the wilderness, the tumbled boulders, the
                    great age and dignity, a certain grasp the air, the light, the shapes accord in
                    happy harmony” all is very true. He had been one of my favorite writers since
                    childhood. I had grown up with the “Child's Garden of Verses” a dear friend had
                    given me when I was very young. He died in Samoa and wrote his own epithet, now
                    in every anthology of English poetry. Eloquent in his untroubled acceptance of
                    the end of physical life and his ardent faith in the world to come.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>My life was different in Paris than Tangier. I was fulfilling myself with other
                    things. I joined the American library and began reading the history of France by
                    Andre Morua, which became my bible. French lessons were resumed twice a week
                    with Madame Marshorn, who also taught at the Sorbonne. We were both delighted
                    one day to discover we had lived in Japan at the same time. As I had been
                    wanting to know more about French art, literature and music the British embassy
                    sent me Andre Michelle, who had taught French literature in French at Harvard.
                    Part of my course in culture endeavor was to go on ventures in the countryside's
                    historic sights with only French speaking people and a French guide. There was a
                    vast difference between a tourist staying in a Ritz Hotel suite and what a young
                    person who lives there sees of that same country. The two perspectives are
                    totally different. To know the language, the customs, the habits, to seek out
                    the hidden spots and to taste the simple pleasure of local life is to come to
                    love a country. Above all it means understanding the people and true familiarity
                    with a foreign country and its people in such a precious personal and emotional
                    experience one carries it deep in the heart all through life. One of the
                    advantages of the Foreign Service is that one remains long enough at each post
                    to acquire a more thorough knowledge than a visitor can.</p>
                <p>One of the most ingrained French habits is holiday en mass in August. They
                    virtually close down their country for a month in a single minded effort to get
                    away from it all. If the Parisian who stays behind locks himself out of his
                    house on August 1, chances are he will not be able to get back in until
                    September. And locksmiths are not the only absent tradesmen. But for me, this
                    was the best time to enjoy Paris when one could really feel the heartbeat of the
                    city. Nothing is dead here, least of all the past which forms an integral part
                    of the present. On Sundays, Andre Trealay was showing me something of his Paris
                    and the surrounding country. Being with Andre was a liberal education. He told
                    me so much that enhanced my appreciation. One Sunday we followed the narrow
                    streets up to Montmartre, the once artistic quarter where young Utrillo and
                    Picasso and so many other painters and poets lived and created. From here was a
                    breathtaking view over the whole of Paris. Another Sunday, to admire the
                    infinite and beautiful detail of Gothic architecture of the famous religious
                    edifice, Notre Dame. They say one should really see it first from a small point
                    coming under the Pont De La Tournelle or from this bridge early in the morning
                    when there is a direct light on the flying buttresses or late in the dying day
                    when it is so illuminated against a flaming sunset. Then we wandered around the
                    La Cite, the oldest quarter in Paris, founded before the Christians and
                    retaining much of its old charm.</p>
                <p>A Sunday was spent at Chantilly, famed for its chateau, forests and great
                    stables. There was so much to admire in the museum of this chateau that it could
                    be visited and revisited. I lingered longest over the superb illuminations of
                    the world famous book known as the Duc de Berry. Afterwards roamed through the
                    forest. Andre loved to walk and so did I.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The next Sunday we went to Compiegne which evoked memories of Bonaparte. Napoleon
                    met Marie Louise here in 1810 and chose it as a residence after his second
                    marriage. It enjoyed its most brilliant days during the second empire and its
                    royal residence is more ancient than any other. Louise XVI, when Dauphin, came
                    here in 1770 to meet his fianc�e and bride, Marie Antoinette of Austria. The
                    most visited part of the forest is the Armistice clearing where there is a
                    monument commemorating the signing of the armistice on November 11, 1918.</p>
                <p>On September 6, 1950, I wrote home: My ponies have arrived. Offspring of the
                    ponies Andre had shown me near Dax where they had been breed. They were being
                    kept in a small m�nage near the Bois by M. Gager, who at one time had been in
                    charge of Cote's stable. It proved to be easier to find a place for ponies in
                    Paris than myself. They were a handsome pair. Half brothers and so well matched.
                    One had a list and one had a star on his forehead. Both had a pair of white
                    socks and their tails were cropped which made them look very smart. I called
                    them Fussy and Frisky, appropriate names, I thought because each one was just
                    that. Gager was training them and giving me driving lessons in French. He spoke
                    no English, so obviously I had language lessons as well. Although I was learning
                    to handle the reins properly, I never could learn to roll my “r's” convincingly.
                    The two seated trap was yellow and black. On the harness over the leather shades
                    of the horses eyes in little brass letters were my initials, VHB. The equipage
                    was terribly chic.</p>
                <p>Every Saturday and Sunday morning at 11:00, I was driving along the quiet roads
                    of the Bois. It was great fun. Eventually when I gained more confidence and
                    became more proficient in handling the ponies, the groom, Albert, accompanied
                    me. He was an endearing little old man, actually fitted into this small trap
                    more comfortably than Gager who with ruddy red cheeks from his native Normandy
                    was rather rotund and robust, but always cheery and chatty. This rare recreation
                    was one of my greatest pleasures in Paris.</p>
                <p>On one Saturday when I went driving, I noticed all of the buildings and buses
                    along the Champs Elysees had the familiar Moroccan flag flying in honor of the
                    visit of the Sultan. All the traffic was stopped to allow his grand entourage to
                    pass as he was going out to Bagatelle to stay with his son, Mouli Hassem, his
                    official visit over. Also from Morocco one day came Bill Chase, the tall, good
                    looking chap who with another American, Jay Hazelwood, ran the Paradise, a
                    rendezvous for every one in Tangier. It was like a ray of sunshine to see him
                    and hear all the news from my former post. He said Jay would be going to Egypt
                    with Countess LeFay, she takes him everywhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>One evening I invited my French friend, Yvonne St. Leger, to Prunniers for
                    dinner. It had become my favorite for seafood. Afterward I had tickets booked a
                    week in advance, it was so popular, to hear Maurice Chevalier. I had always
                    adored him. Now 62, but like an ageless aperitif, light and zestful with the
                    same magnetic smile. He had a love of life and romance. “Louise” was the only
                    song he sang in English and his mangled English became more of his charm. The
                    day of his death—he was buried January 5, 1972—seemed a little less gay because
                    he was gone. He was more than an addition to the theater, he was an addition to
                    life. When I was describing his performance to Gager in French on my drive
                    through the Bois the next morning, he said he knew him quite well. In fact
                    Chevalier had given him his photograph.</p>
                <p>About mid-October, Miss Synder, my supervisor in the passport section sailed for
                    home leave on the America with her great friend, Miss Shipley, then head of the
                    Passport Division in the State Department. She would not be back until after
                    Christmas so she left us all her usual lovely little gifts. The news of the
                    attempted assassination of President Truman at Blair House which reached me in
                    early November, was a terrible shock but so great that he escaped.</p>
                <p>Mario Sinwa, who lived in Marrakech, I met for tea one Sunday afternoon at the
                    George Cinque, always gay with Americans. She wanted me to take her to lunch at
                    the Marshall Plan cafeteria. It was very simple, but everything American
                    interested her. It was just across the street from Patue and where a woman I
                    knew there, Odette, said she couldn't find an inexpensive place in the
                    neighborhood for lunch. I suggest that we go there and she loved it too.</p>
                <p>Then we went to the Follies Bergeres together one evening. Always a spectacle.
                    Exquisite sets and nudes parading around with gorgeous accessories. The real bit
                    of the entire show was the three Peters sisters, enormous colored girls
                    appearing in costumes which accentuated their enormity. Their performance
                    dressed in ballet skirts on a trapeze and again in toreador pants fighting a
                    bull and finally in the voluminous djellabas the Arabs wear, was hilarious. They
                    did a perfect takeoff of Maurice Chevalier with his usual rakish straw hat
                    singing, “Savoir, savoir, savoir.” That was wildly applauded.</p>
                <p>The Countess Dabars, who arranged parties and receptions at USIS, invited me to
                    her home for cocktails one Sunday afternoon. She said she would like me to meet
                    some of her French friends and relatives who had homes in the country. I thought
                    it was very kind of her. She was of Japanese origin and like many women of her
                    race gentle and refined and elegant in her simplicity, pale and fragile as a
                    flower. In mutual admiration of her oriental country gave me an immediate
                    rapport and we became very fond of each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Christmas was approaching and I had some accumulated leave to take. Yvonne St.
                    Leger was going to her daughter in Tunis and wanted me to join her. Then Mr.
                    Davies, the old padre in Tangier who had been on a brief holiday in Paris,
                    invited me to spend Christmas in England where he was now living with his
                    married daughter, whose husband was with the British government in Lagos. A
                    telegram came followed by a note from Sheila Green who I had known in Bermuda
                    and was also back in England and asked me to come there saying it would be just
                    like Bermuda all over again where we had such a happy time together. I more than
                    appreciated these kind friends thinking of me at this special time, but I really
                    wanted just a rest somewhere in the sun. Our consul in Tenerife, the Canary
                    Islands, wrote it had a delightful climate and one could swim at Christmas and
                    it was very quiet, just what I wanted. But, alas, all my efforts to get there
                    were in vain. I did manage to get as far as Madrid but the planes were all
                    booked and though I went to the airport and waited in the pouring rain for a
                    last minute cancellation, no luck. Then I decided to go to Malaga where my
                    friends the George Palmers were on post. They made reservations for me at the
                    Minermar Hotel and after an all day train ride arrived there at midnight. The
                    next day I drove out to Torremolinos to the Santa Clara Hotel which I had heard
                    was so charming, operated by Mr. and Mrs. Saunders. He was English and she was
                    Danish. They were completely booked, but kindly tucked me in a room for the
                    night. I changed to another the next day. The food was excellent and it had a
                    cozy atmosphere, mostly English guests. Much to my surprise and delight, I found
                    Gilly Gillmore there with his French companion, Madame Dorne. And it was
                    heavenly to find blue skies and bright sun. When Madame Dorne heard I was unable
                    to get to the Canaries where Andre Trealay was vacationing, she exclaimed, “Why
                    you can't leave Andre there alone over Christmas, you must telephone.” So I got
                    a telephone call through to him on the 23rd and we finally spoke together on
                    Christmas morning. He said he would join me as soon as he could get
                    reservations, but it was a week before we heard on New Year's Day that he would
                    be arriving January 3. Such was the communication and transportation service in
                    Spain in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>On Christmas Day the Palmers gave an eggnog party. A lot of the guests at the
                    Santa Clara were invited as they had lived there before finding a house and knew
                    the Saunders well. They asked me to stay on for lunch with their house guests,
                    the Morrisons I had known in Tangier, and the consulate staff, including a
                    courier in for the day who made a priceless remark a propos to making his plane
                    that “the mail must go through, come rain, hail or olive oil.” It was a cherry
                    party as we gathered around the Christmas tree with the Palmers' two young
                    children. Then we all drove back to the Santa Clara for the party the Saunders
                    have every Christmas night. The British Consul gave the traditional toast. The
                    New Year's Eve party was equally gay. I was doing the Lambeth walk way into the
                    wee small hours of the morning. After that I slept until noon every day until
                    Andre came on January 3, his birthday. That evening I gave a birthday party for
                    him. There were nine of us, including the Palmers. Champagne and a beautiful
                    birthday cake and all sang happy birthday to him. We were able to have a few
                    walks along the beach together and a drive with Gilly up the Costa del Sol
                    before I had to leave two days later. This time the little Santa Clara Hotel was
                    the only one there and Torremolinos was just a tiny village asleep in the sun on
                    the main road between Malaga and Marbella and La Linsa. But now, like others
                    caught in the touristic boom, it has swept head long to the present and one of
                    the fastest growing resorts in Spain and the charming little Santa Clara is no
                    longer there. And dear George Palmer died in the summer of 1976.</p>
                <p>When I returned to the embassy, my desk, of course, was covered with work. Also
                    Christmas cards had accumulated. One from the Duke of Trevare from Tangier
                    asking me to let him know if I ever went to Seville. He would give me a note of
                    introduction to his friends the two DeCasso sisters. I was sorry to hear from
                    the Duchess of Richelieu that her husband had been desperately ill while in
                    Paris last May and had taken him to Geneva where he had been in hospital twice
                    and now home in New York with double pneumonia. A friend of Andre's to whom he
                    had introduced me, Count Robert Dillon was in Paris for a few days from his
                    chateau near Toulouse. He was interested in the breeding of my ponies. I took
                    him for a long drive one Sunday. It was getting nippy now so I wore a newspaper
                    around my chest under my heaviest sweater and coat to cut the wind. But
                    regardless of the weather I was always in the Bois with my ponies at 11:00 every
                    Saturday and Sunday morning. They say the Bois is one of the places in the world
                    “en souffler esprit,” where the spirit breathes. It warmed my heart to hear the
                    little children clap their hands with joy when they heard the clip-clop of my
                    ponies coming.</p>
                <p>I was very distressed to receive news that my dear brother, Harold, was in
                    hospital with TB. I wrote him that every time I went to the Madeleine for
                    flowers, which was often for no matter how deep the winter it was always spring
                    among those scented stalls, I wished I could be placing them by his bedside and
                    hoped he was faithful to his communions as there was so much power in prayer.
                    Besides my regular communions at 8:30 on Sunday, I tripped around the corner to
                    the little British embassy church on Wednesdays at the same time. These brief
                    devotions helped sustain me all day long at my desk.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Count Dillon invited me to dinner one evening and was very anxious that I see the
                    film, “Gone With The Wind,” with him. Even though I had seen it over ten years
                    ago in Honolulu, I shared his enthusiasm in watching again this romantic epic,
                    probably the most legendary production in Hollywood history. It has remained one
                    of the most popular and successful pictures ever made.</p>
                <p>Whenever Dillon came to Paris we often lunched and dined together. I found him
                    quite delightful. Although his English was limited and so was my French, it was
                    no bar to a fluent conversation. He had a good looking serious face and was very
                    courteous and conservative. A country loving man who walked with the erect grace
                    of the aristocracy he represented. He was of Irish origin and came from one of
                    the oldest families of France. He always appeared deeply concerned about
                    something and one evening spoke to me with great earnestness and enthusiasm of
                    his desire to go to South America on a mission for the French government. And he
                    did eventually, to Quito, Ecuador. One of his reasons was that he felt that the
                    Russians would be here within a year and he wanted to close his enormous chateau
                    because he said he would never sell it. If the Russians came, he advised me to
                    escape with my ponies to his chateau and said I could be there in ten days. I
                    thanked him for wishing to rescue a damsel in distress, but laughingly said, “I
                    could just see myself with my possessions on the back seat of my pony trap
                    flying over the border like Scarlet O'Hara in “Gone With The Wind.”</p>
                <p>Mildred had been in Seville then came to Paris for a brief visit before we went
                    to Luxembourg for Easter weekend. Mrs. Truman had given her a note of
                    introduction to Perle Mesta, who was then our minister. Madame Mesta was not
                    there at that time, she was spending her Easter holiday in another part of
                    Europe. However, her colored butler with true southern hospitality had invited
                    us into the residence for a cup of tea. It was then that I saw her fabulous
                    collection of Mason porcelain birds which were perfectly exquisite. She very
                    kindly sent an invitation for my sister to return the following week again.
                    Luxembourg had a fairy-like charm with its cobblestone streets, medieval
                    castles, ruins of fortress walls, watch towers and turrets. During the war the
                    Grand Duchess Charlotte, by will of her people, went to the United States for
                    the duration. When she met President Roosevelt he said to her, “Don't worry my
                    child, I will take you home again.” Those words appeared across the face of a
                    special commemorative stamp of Luxembourg printed below the likeness of the
                    Grand Duchess and her benefactor, the late President. For many Americans,
                    Luxembourg is a place of pilgrimage. About three miles from the city is Hamm.
                    There on a gently sloping valley is a field which is forever America. Below the
                    serene town lies over 5,000 servicemen, each with a marker. One cross by itself
                    is inscribed: “General S. Patton, Jr., General Third Army, California, December
                    21, 1945.” This is where he was laid at the head of his men following his death
                    in a car accident after the war was over.</p>
                <p>It was a great shock to receive the very sad news of the death of Mr. Clay
                    Merrill after a short illness in Bermuda on May 8 and saddened me deeply. I felt
                    I had lost my best friend in the Foreign Service. I immediately wrote to dear
                    Mrs. Merrill because I knew what this great lost would mean for her.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>One evening a French friend, Robert Jevey, and I went to see the “Consul” a play
                    I could very well appreciate.</p>
                <p>As Paris was celebrating its 2000 years celebration at this time, 1951, there
                    were a lot of interesting events going on. Alice Poole, a long time friend which
                    whom I had lived in a little Japanese house in Honolulu and former keeper of the
                    prints at the Art Academy there, paid a visit. We went to the Louvre together to
                    hear a concert of early French music.</p>
                <p>In June I was promoted to receptionist in the passport section and was so happy.
                    No more lifting of dossiers, pushing and pulling of drawers, looking at a desk
                    piled high with files. I was still kept busy, but now there was an occasional
                    lull where there never was before. Now my job was to answer inquiries and pull
                    the cards and files on people who needed passports or renewals or any other
                    service our section gave; type letters to be given to other embassies for visas;
                    and I was also beginning to take a few applications. So I was learning bit by
                    bit more citizenship work.</p>
                <p>The Consul General, Mr. Grey, called all those who had been promoted to his
                    office to congratulate them as soon as he had returned from his holiday. The
                    inspector had arrived and asked the usual questions—how we lived, who are our
                    friends, how we get our exercise, etc. To one question, “What is your goal in
                    the Foreign Service?” I answered, “To become a vice consul,” which he duly
                    noted. I also mentioned I should like to be considered for a post where I could
                    save some money. I thought Paris very expensive. I spoke of Bangkok. He said
                    that Colombo, Ceylon was also a delightful post and a differential, meaning more
                    money was allowed for living there.</p>
                <p>Edgar Hume paid me another surprise visit at the embassy, this time in uniform
                    emblazoned with ribbons and medals and looked so handsome and young. He said he
                    was spending most of his time now in Korea, but was in Paris for a medical
                    conference. He needed letters to obtain visas for Syria and Lebanon. I was glad
                    I could be of this small service to him.</p>
                <p>Count Dillon was also back in Paris, too. We dined one evening around the corner
                    from my hotel at la Truite in the picturesque Cite de Returro entered by a
                    grilled gateway. It became one of our favorite restaurants where we often went
                    with Andre who was now having the cure at Vichy. He wanted Andre to bring me to
                    his chateau and show me his country in September.</p>
                <p>On the Fourth of July the Bruces gave the usual reception for the Americans.
                    Princess Pignatelli, whom I had met, asked to go with me. She was a Biddle from
                    Philadelphia. Her first husband was a Spanish grandee and her early life with
                    the court in Madrid sounded glamorous. She divorced him and married a Frenchman
                    who she also divorced. Then she retrieved the title of the first husband.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Mrs. Merrill was leaving Bermuda on July 18 as she had been appointed assistant
                    conference officer at our embassy in Geneva. In early August I made reservations
                    at the Louiemont for her and her two colored servants who were accompanying her.
                    She was to arrive on the America due just as I had planned to take my holiday to
                    Dillon's place, but I realized I could not leave while she was here, nor, of
                    course, wanted to for I was anxious to see her and more especially as she was
                    bereaved. I met her at the boat train in an embassy car and we were together the
                    entire time she was in Paris. We both shed tears when we spoke of Mr. Merrill.
                    She wanted to revisit all the little places where they had been together here in
                    1949. For diversion I took her up Faubourg Saint Honor� to enjoy the shop
                    windows created by Madame Baumel for Hermes. They always had an incomparable
                    charm and fantasy of their own. Parisians go to see a new Baumel window as they
                    go to see a new play.</p>
                <p>I introduced her to Miss Synder and they had a very long conversation. She told
                    her what a good job I had done under Clay in Bermuda. I hoped it bore some
                    weight. When I mentioned that they both had astrology in common, Mrs. Merrill
                    immediately drew Miss Synder's horoscope and that was a bond at once.</p>
                <p>For years I had wanted to go to the Balearic Islands and at last I was to have my
                    dream holiday to Majorca. At Brentano's I was delighted to find a book,
                    “Polonaise” on the life of Chopin which I read on the four hour Air France
                    flight to Palma. An attractive American woman, Mrs. Chamberlain, had a car and
                    chauffeur waiting for her when we arrived at the airport in Palma and kindly
                    offered to drive me to my hotel, the Victoria. There I had a room and full
                    pension for 150 pesetas plus 17 percent tax, about $3.75 in those days and
                    considered an extremely modest price even then.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Chamberlain had mentioned that she had rented this furnished villa with five
                    bedrooms and two baths for ten dollars a month and also had the services of a
                    maid and a gardener.</p>
                <p>The hotel was perfectly situated where one could watch the life on the
                    Mediterranean from spacious terraces bordered by flowers and shaded by pine
                    trees. During the day it was a gorgeous sight to see the colors change on the
                    cathedral which loomed up in the distant. One of the four famous gothic ones in
                    the world. And at night enchanting while dining on the terrace to watch the
                    boats going to Barcelona brilliantly lighted. Palma reminded me a little of
                    Tangier with its Spanish influence and slightly Moorish flavor.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The day after my arrival, I took an all day excursion to Valldemosa and Soller.
                    Valldemosa had been immortalized by George Sand, the romantic French authoress
                    and Frederick Chopin, the great Polish pianist and composer ever since their
                    historic winter there in 1838-39. Majorca had made a virtual shrine of their
                    quarters which they occupied in a deserted monastery in which the monks had been
                    evicted in 1935. Their three cells opened on to charming little garden patios
                    where they contemplated the rustic panorama and drew inspiration for their
                    greatest works. Here George Sand wrote “Spiridon” and later published “Un Hiver
                    a Majorque” in which were the finest descriptive writing of her whole career.
                    She was the first writer to adequately succeed in conveying the charms of the
                    Majorca countryside most vividly.</p>
                <p>Another who came many years later, also enamored of the beauties of the island,
                    was His Imperial Highness the Archduke of Austria, Louie Salvador, but known in
                    all of Majorca simply as S. Arduc. His exhaustive knowledge was revealed in the
                    wealth of impressions since he did not sell his publications but gave them away
                    as presents to his family and other chosen people, they have a special value in
                    their rareness.</p>
                <p>Chopin, although in fading health, with the aid of a pitiful Majorcan piano was
                    composing his most dramatic and exquisite inspired by the wonderful atmosphere
                    of the monastery. There was still a trace of the monastic life within the walls.
                    The smell of incense and solitary silence. Among the compositions created there
                    were his famous preludes.</p>
                <p>After leaving Valldemosa the stretch of coast line to Dael was magnificent.
                    Beautiful vistas of the sea on one side and hills covered with pine and ancient
                    olive trees on the other. It was no wonder that Gustave Durer was inspired by
                    the Majorcan olive trees to illustrate one of the best traditions Dante's Divine
                    Comedy. For him Majorca was a corner blessed by heaven. Dael attracted many
                    writers and artists including the well known writer Robert Graves who for 47
                    years has been voluntarily exiled in his home Canelluno, the house far away, and
                    has done so much to help preserve the place from becoming spoiled.</p>
                <p>We drove on over the craggy mountainside to Soller, a picturesque little village
                    in a rich valley of fragrant orange and lemon trees surrounded by high
                    mountains. An amusing Toonerville type of tram clanks its way to the nearby
                    puerto. On the return to Palma we stopped to visit one of the old historic
                    Majorcan country mansions.</p>
                <p>The next day I climbed up through the pine woods to the famous 14th century
                    castle of Bellvere that overlooks Palma. It is a rare type of construction in
                    Spain, a circular design with simple lines descended from the gothic. As there
                    were still many Arabs here at the time, Moorish slaves who were skilled artisans
                    were employed in the construction of the castle giving it a Moorish influence.
                    The archaeological museum in side was of great interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>One day I took a bus trip to Formentor. The zigzag road was perilous in places,
                    but with fantastic views of majestic beauty and absolutely unforgettable. There
                    was a luxurious hotel on the white sandy beach with extensive gardens and
                    circled by mountains with the great panorama of the Bay of Pollensa. It was a
                    perfect setting for a vacation retreat where one could enjoy the peace and
                    tranquility for which the island has always been renown.</p>
                <p>Sitting beside me on the bus was a most interesting English girl, Machin Goodall,
                    who breeds, trains, sells and shows her own jumpers. She had won a thousand
                    prizes since the age of eight and her grandfather had been huntsman to the
                    Queen. Of course, I spoke of my precious pair of ponies in Paris. So we found
                    much to talk about.</p>
                <p>The only sign of Americanization that I saw were two little sweat shirts on two
                    little Spanish boys which had blazed across the front, “New York Giants.” The
                    island then was relatively unspoiled. I had never enjoyed a holiday so much for
                    so little money. After a smooth flight with champagne and lunch, I arrived back
                    in Paris to find the sun shining. It was the first time I had returned to Paris
                    from a holiday when it wasn't pouring with rain.</p>
                <p>The Richelieus were back in Paris and in early October they invited me to lunch
                    at the Cert Enter Ala. I enjoyed seeing them very much, but was distressed to
                    hear that the Duke has had leukemia since 1948. The Duchess came up to my hotel
                    room to look through my “Vogues” to find some models for having some clothes
                    made here. She said she was getting too fat to order from Bloomingdale any more.
                    They will be returning to the States in the ship they always sailed in, the
                    Mauritania and asked me to look them up when I came to New York in the spring.
                    My home leave was due March 15.</p>
                <p>George and Ruth Palmer were also in Paris about this time and we had a good get
                    together over cocktails at the Crillon. George invited me to come to Malaga and
                    said he would send me to Granada where the Good Friday celebrations were really
                    worth seeing. George's parents gave a delightful party on Avenue Foche to which
                    I was invited. Ambassador Palmer and George both served at our embassy in
                    Afghanistan together. The only time father and son have ever served at the same
                    post at the same time.</p>
                <p>One of the French employees at the embassy and her husband drove me to Bourg St.
                    Leonard one Saturday where there was a chateau that Count Dillon very much
                    admired and wanted me to see. Madame de Forcefeel received us for about an hour
                    and said she had seen me driving my ponies in the Bois.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>One day in early December I happened to see Mr. Plitt, who had been our minister
                    at the legation in Tangier, as I was going to lunch with a friend and went up to
                    speak to him. “How do you do, Mr. Plitt? Do you remember me?” I said. When he
                    replied, “Yes, sure. Virginia Biddle,” my friend remarked, “You have a good
                    memory.” Then with a smile he said to her, “Yes, I always remember the
                    outstanding members of my staff.” The sudden unexpected compliment slightly
                    embarrassed me and I blushed a little as I walked away. I never thought that I
                    had been particularly outstanding, but it was evident that he was still in the
                    diplomatic service, though he was then in Paris with NATO and staying at the
                    Crillon.</p>
                <p>My English friends, Muriel and Reg Cope I had met at a coffee at Bishop Chambers
                    invited me to a cocktail party that the St. George's Society gave at the Cert
                    Enter Ala. Among the guests was Lady Diana Cooper. I had seen her as the Madonna
                    in “The Miracle” when I was in boarding school, and she hadn't changed a bit
                    since then. The same beautiful blue eyes, exquisite skin, tall and graceful and
                    very feminine with every movement so effortless. She was simply dressed and
                    wrapped in a gorgeous sable coat. I could hardly take my admiring eyes off of
                    her.</p>
                <p>Christmas 1951 in Paris was quite active. Ambassador and Mrs. Bruce gave a huge
                    cocktail party for 1500 Americans. Mr. Grey, the consul general, gave a
                    beautiful party at his home for all the consular sections. Young 14 year old
                    Hugh Cope was home from school, Tonbridge in England, for the holidays, and we
                    often went clopping through the leafy Bois in my trap. He adored my ponies. On
                    Christmas Eve, Muriel, Reg and Hugh and I attended midnight services at the
                    British embassy church. Then they all came up to my room at the Louismont for
                    fruitcake and eggnog and helped to light the teeny weenie candles I had tied
                    with ribbons to my teeny weenie Christmas tree. The next day they invited me to
                    tea and to hear King George give his first speech over the wireless since his
                    illness, and I stayed on for dinner.</p>
                <p>My brother's failing health in California was giving me increasing anxiety and I
                    wanted to reach him as soon as possible. My home leave was due February 4, but
                    knew I couldn't budge before travel orders. It could take some time for them to
                    appear and they could very well be enmeshed in a tangle of bureaucratic red
                    tape, so I was most grateful when Miss Synder suggested that Emily Cox in the
                    personnel section wire the Department for them. The reservation was requested on
                    a flight to California for February 8, which would arrive the next day in Los
                    Angeles. Everyone was most helpful and understanding. I felt Harold's condition
                    was too critical not to make every effort possible to reach him as soon as I
                    could. I sent a note to him to say he was to receive a happy surprise soon, just
                    a hint of something pleasant to cheer him and to keep up his morale.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Just before I left I went to the Madeleine and bought a bouquet of yellow tulips
                    and lavender hyacinths to take to him in the hospital. At Los Angeles my father
                    met me at the Biltmore beaming. I flung myself into his arms and fondly clung to
                    him. We were so happy to see each other and was so relieved to hear that Harold
                    had improved. When I reached the hospital he seemed so much better than I
                    expected to find him. He was sleeping well, appetite was good and seemed
                    cheerful and talkative. He coughed some and took oxygen occasionally, but on the
                    whole appeared to be improving. The flowers from Paris had kept beautifully and
                    pleased him. The last blooming tulip was poked into a bouquet of peach blossoms
                    I brought him on St. Valentine's Day, February 14.</p>
                <p>Dad and I stayed in the comfortable visitors quarters at the veterans hospital in
                    San Fernando and visited Harold as often as possible. It was a joy to see what a
                    great favorite Dad was with all the nurses and doctors and everyone there.
                    Harold, too, who had inherited our deceased Swedish mother's sweet and gentle
                    nature. He was so good looking. The reports from the doctors were that Harold
                    would always have TB. Unfortunately at that time the remedy for TB did not exist
                    as they do now and due to a deteriorating heart condition, he could go very
                    suddenly or be with us for several years. It was just a day to day case. When I
                    left in early March, General Rolland sent me to the airport in his car, he
                    seemed stronger and was taking less oxygen, but I was never to see him
                    again.</p>
                <p>My dear friend, Barbara Bowen Nicholas invited me to spend a few days with her in
                    her charming home, The Carolines, in Hillsborough just outside of San Francisco.
                    It was pleasant to be with her again. We had always been very fond of each other
                    in Honolulu. When I returned to Washington I returned to the Department for
                    consultation and reassignment to Paris. The rest of my home leave was spent with
                    my sister in her Georgetown apartment. We had tea with Mrs. Truman one afternoon
                    when she showed us through the White House which had been beautifully renovated
                    since we had had tea with her at Blair House just before I left for Paris about
                    two years ago.</p>
                <p>One day I lunched at the University Club quite amicably with my former husband,
                    Charles, and his second wife, Yetti, a Dutch girl he had met in Singapore.
                    Afterwards I went to the Society of Cincinnati because Count Dillon had asked me
                    to bring information about a relative of his who was a member of the Order of
                    Cincinnati, an elite organization made up of descendants of those French who
                    helped in the fight for American independence. There I found hanging on the wall
                    a portrait of his ancestor.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>While I was in New York, Mrs. John Hubbard invited me to lunch with her at the
                    Ritz. On another day I lunched at Cheri's with an old Briar Cliff chum, Marjorie
                    Heather Rolston. The Duchess of Richelieu had written from Florida to her
                    sister, Miss Wise, to invite Mildred and me to luncheon at their apartment in
                    Gracey Square, which I thought was most kind. We enjoyed ourselves very much.
                    Every time I returned to the States on home leave a childhood friend, Sheradon
                    Logen took me to the Harvard Club for dinner and said, “You know Virginia, it is
                    always a standing invitation,” and so it was.</p>
                <p>I returned to Paris by way of Spain. In Seville I stayed with the DeCasso
                    sisters, friends of the Duke of Trevare I had known in Tangier. They were both
                    perfectly lovely and their home had a completely Spanish ambiance. On nearly
                    every table were autographed photographs in silver frames of some member of the
                    Spanish royal family. They were my confidants. They were very confident that
                    Spain would one day return to a monarchy, and so it has. They took me around to
                    their sister-in-law who was unfortunately laid up with a sprained ankle having
                    fallen off a donkey. Such were the perils of the transportation here at that
                    time. But her charming husband drove me with the DeCassos to see the house of
                    Countess Boustello, which had a famous collection of old Roman tiles. We also
                    visited the interesting home of Count Sanchui Dolf. I was introduced to another
                    brother who lives in Madrid. An engineer who had something to do with building
                    the hotel Alfonso. Then they were my guests at the Christine Hotel to see the
                    Flamingo dancers.</p>
                <p>At 6:30 the next morning I left in the pouring rain on the train for Granada
                    where Mr. Louis A. Bolline, Director General of the Spanish State Tourist
                    Department had arranged for me see everything Spanish. Mr. Goredo of Cooks met
                    me and showed me all around the Palico del Generalife and the Alhambra, and took
                    me to the gypsy dances in the cafes in the evening. He kept lamenting that I was
                    seeing his Alhambra in this awful weather. I was grateful for my winter coat,
                    galoshes, and furs, which I even wore in bed for breakfast, the fur that is. The
                    Alhambra Palace where I stayed offered the breathtaking view, both of the city
                    and the flood lit Alhambra. I was so disappointed not to have a room at the
                    famous Parador, but it was fully booked as it usually is as it has only about a
                    dozen rooms. However, I had luncheon there and discovered sitting at the table
                    next to me was the Marquis de Amodio and his wife, the niece of the Duke de
                    Richelieu. I had been twice to their home in Paris and they were both brown as
                    berries having been motoring in Morocco. I said how much I had enjoyed lunching
                    with the Duchess de Richelieu's sister, Miss Wise, when I was in New York. It
                    was good news to hear that the Duke was much better and that they would be in
                    Paris in May and asked me to call them when I got back there.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>While I was in Granada, the Duchess De La Thera, to whom I had a note of
                    introduction invited me twice to luncheon at her home where Manuel de Falla had
                    once lived. He was one of Spain's greatest composers of Andelusian and Gypsy
                    music. One of de Falla's master works is his memorable “Nights In the Garden of
                    Spain,” in which he captured all of the mystery, exoticism and elusive quality
                    of the romantic gardens of southern Spain. He bust stood at the end of the
                    pathway in her garden. One day when I was there, “Town and Country” was taking a
                    picture of her and her house to be published probably in November. She was a
                    tiny person and much decorated for all she had done during the war. Living with
                    her was a charming French woman, Madame Yvonne. Before I left Granada, she sent
                    to me at my hotel two adorable silver spoons with bullfighters on each end. And
                    at Christmas I received a lovely card with the message: “Wishing you a very
                    happy Christmas and New Year and hoping to see you again in Granada,
                    Affectionately, Rosario.”</p>
                <p>Escerile was very much enjoyed. When I arrived at the little Lis Hotel I liked so
                    much in Madrid, Madame Faragi met me with open arms and said I could have the
                    room with the terrace which was brighter and cozier. I went back to the Prado
                    for the third time and had a wonderful English-speaking guide. I just adored the
                    place. The King of Iraq was there causing great excitement. I had my hair done
                    at the Ritz and then boarded a 9:00pm Air France plane for Paris and arrived at
                    midnight. My home leave was over for another two years.</p>
                <p>I reached Paris in time to greet the horse chestnuts in the Champs Elysees and
                    reported back to the embassy on Monday, May 12. Just one week later, on May 19,
                    I was speaking on the telephone with my French friend, Yvonne St. Leger about an
                    apartment for Marcel Leconte when the radio operator from upstairs in the
                    embassy brought me a telegram. While I was still talking he showed me the
                    message with the very sad news that my brother had died and I immediately burst
                    into tears and although we had been speaking in English, Yvonne quickly lapsed
                    into her native French to express her deep feeling and sympathy. They were
                    loving words of comfort to me as I hung up. Then I bowed my head on the table,
                    buried my face in my arms and sobbed. My heart ached and also for my father
                    because the affection flowed strongly between father and son and I knew the
                    sense of loneliness he must be feeling. I was grateful that my sister could fly
                    out to him and they could comfort each other in our great sorrow.</p>
                <p>I continued to work to seek distraction and my friends comforted me. Miss Synder
                    took my hand in hers and said, “You are being very brave and I want you to know
                    how deeply I sympathize. If there is anything I can do, let me know. I lost my
                    mother, my father and a sister I adored while in the Foreign Service and I could
                    not go home because I could not be spared.” So I felt she did understand and
                    there would be difficult days ahead for me. When Marcel Leconte heard the news
                    he dropped all the telegrams to do with Dean Acheson's arrival and took me for a
                    coffee and short walk in the sunshine and said, “It is written that you should
                    have the visit with him when he was not too ill, and for Mildred to be there
                    when most needed as she is so strong.” I agreed that it was all true. What a
                    blessing her friendship was to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Miss Dilkes, the charming receptionist of the embassy, took me to Rumplemeyer's
                    to lunch and was very sympathetic. I was grateful Muriel Cope had told Bishop
                    Chambers of my lost so he must have understood my tears at the altar when I took
                    communion. It helped to have Dottie Cain near me in the hotel, who was now
                    transferred to Paris from Geneva.</p>
                <p>May 22 was Ascension Day and a holiday. After early communion I went around to
                    the nice Madame who had packed the flowers for Harold and then I told her she
                    was gone. I then bought some tiny white carnations and some deep pink ones and
                    red roses, the same kind that I hoped had been placed in Harold's buttonhole at
                    the funeral, which could have been taking place that very day, the date we had
                    lost our dear mother in 1924.</p>
                <p>May 24 was bright but nippy. I took my ponies for a promenade in the Bois and
                    went by to see my French friend, Nicole de Fressiniat who came with me in the
                    back seat of the trap in the afternoon for tea at the Copes and then to see
                    friends they had introduced me to, Prince and Princess Kandaouroff. Dimitri was
                    a White Russian with a bright round face, always smiling. Beris was English but
                    with all the joie de vivre of the French. They lived in a small house on the
                    street leading up to Montmartre and one entered through a butcher shop. But
                    their salon was always filled with interesting people and the vodka that she
                    made herself provided instant warmth to any occasion. Theirs was gay, amusing
                    and entertaining.</p>
                <p>Paris remains a favorite goal for �migr�s where a Russian community existed even
                    before the revolution. The day we were there she had gathered a few friends to
                    celebrate her 40th birthday, and much to her surprise had recently given birth
                    to a baby, Maria who had her mother's lovely big eyes. I especially enjoyed
                    talking about Corsica with Jacque Olivetti, the husband of Princess Augusta of
                    Hess, soon to be called Fifi because it was not long before we were friends and
                    calling each other by first names. She had a little girl appeal and wanted to be
                    a ballerina and was always doing the pas de deux. Her sister, Princess Olga of
                    Hess, I saw less of because she was often in Istanbul, Turkey where she lived
                    part of the time with her Yugoslav husband, Dr. Savich. Their mother was an
                    American born Elizabeth Reed Rogers from Sterling, Kentucky and knew the Trimble
                    name well. She had a house in Cannes where she often entertained the Duke and
                    Duchess of Windsor. Through their father they were related to the King of
                    Denmark. Two sons became American citizens, one was in Houston, Texas and the
                    other in Mexico.</p>
                <p>On other occasions I met there Nicholas Koustadrus, whose mother was the lady in
                    waiting to the Duchess of Kent. Also among Beris's circle of friends was Prince
                    Comene, the Don Carlo branch of the Spanish family, Pretender to the throne and
                    he also painted. He showed me a painting he had done of Queen Elizabeth, which
                    was very regal looking, and some of his other works. He told me that he was the
                    natural son of the Duke of Madrid who was exiled from Spain and later from
                    France and went to Egypt where he, Prince Comene was born. He was educated in
                    Italy and spoke better Italian than Spanish. Beris whispered to me that he had
                    aspirations to marry Princess Margaret, but they tell him that he is too old for
                    her.</p>

                <p>Once I met a pretty Swedish girl who in fact had been Miss Sweden of 1952. She
                    said she was returning to Sweden in order to be at the presentation of the Nobel
                    Prize affair for Winston Churchill. Several times came the Count and Countess
                    Romanet. The Countess was from Australia and always looked so fresh. The Count
                    was one of the few godsons of the Count of Paris.</p>
                <p>One evening I was invited to dine with Mr. Lane, Miss Synder's chief, and his
                    vivacious Scottish wife. Mrs. Grey, the wife of the consul general was there. He
                    was out of town. And a very nice couple, Mr. and Mrs. Adams. He was vice consul
                    in the visa section. The Lanes took me with them the next Sunday afternoon and
                    the Adams to the country. Mrs. Lane was very kindly sending me copies of The New
                    Yorker with the fabulous story of Lord Devine, the art collector.</p>
                <p>Over Labor Day weekend I took a Cook's tour to Mont Saint Michel. We left Paris
                    in a drizzle but it only enhanced the fairylike beauty of this abbey on a rock
                    looming out of the sea in a mist about a mile off the southern coast of
                    Normandy. After 700 years it still has a strange magnetism. At Rouen, saw where
                    Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. It is now a flower market with only a
                    plaque in the pavement and a statue to mark the tragic spot. We passed through
                    fashionable Deauville, Trouville, Pulgage. I made a mental note to read
                    Eisenhower's “European Crusade” when we reached Arromanches because I was told
                    the Normandy landings were very well described in it. We stopped briefly at
                    Bayeux to see the famous tapestries made by Queen Matilda when her husband,
                    William the Conqueror, was off warring in England. The next day we motored
                    through Brittany. We lunched at Alen�on where the lovely lace is made, but as it
                    was a holiday all of the shops were closed. I was delighted to find just up the
                    street the house where Teresa, the little flower of Jesus, was born and chapel
                    next to it. Her christening robe was behind glass. A film had been made of her
                    life. Hope to see it—and I did later in Paris, it was very moving. I had
                    remembered reading her charming story of her life about twenty years ago. Our
                    last stop was at Chartres Cathedral, the third time I had seen it. I never cease
                    to marvel at its exquisite blue windows and fine sculpture.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>When I returned to Paris I was saddened to read in the New York Herald Tribune
                    that the Duke of Richelieu had died on May 30 in a hospital in New York. Towards
                    the end of June I received the following invitation which meant that I was
                    invited by the Society of the Steeplechase of France to drive my ponies in the
                    Prix de Drab and to lunch at the restaurant Lulon with about 25 other invited
                    guests. I was seated with the gentleman in charge and Princess Pignatelli of the
                    Italian branch of the family. The young English beauty, Countess De Lessups, who
                    I had known in Tangier was there. There was one of Count Dillon's sisters. And
                    the daughters of Countess Chaunegnac and Mrs. Stromberg, wife of the Swedish
                    consul in Paris, were there. The Marquis Sedoly, who later asked me to take her
                    for a drive in my trap one day. And many other entitled French and Spanish. The
                    men all wore cutaways and top hats. The women, the most aristocratic in Paris,
                    were dressed exquisitely in garden frocks, big hats and wore lovely jewels. I
                    wore a yellow and blue print dress with a big blue velvet hat with yellow bird
                    of paradise. My ponies wore blue bachelor buttons to match, behind each ear.</p>
                <p>After lunch, Albert, my groom, came with the trap in a grey coachman's coat and
                    top hat. There was a carriage in front of mine and another behind and two mail
                    coaches filled with beautiful women. I was the only woman driving my own
                    equipage and American without a title. We drove up the wide bustling Champs
                    Elysees to the Auteuil race track in front of a battery of cameras and
                    television which excited the ponies so they pulled considerably, but fortunately
                    didn't run away. After witnessing the races at Auteuil we had tea and then drove
                    to the Polo Club where we drove around the race track and had tea again. It had
                    been the day that Paris becomes the acknowledged center of the horse racing
                    world for what is also a major event in the social world. A few days later I
                    received the a charming note enclosing some photos of the occasion.</p>
                <p>The Copes were flying to London for the wedding of one of Muriel's best friends
                    who was marrying the younger son of the Prince Royal and the reception was to be
                    in St. James Palace.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Truman wrote hoping I would see her daughter, Margaret, when she came to
                    Paris and also that she was returning to Independence as her mother had gone
                    completely blind in the last three weeks and was quite upset. She died in
                    December, 1952.</p>
                <p>One weekend I joined an artist friend, Carolyn Van Evera, at the home of Countess
                    Keragariou at St. Servan Sur near St. Malo. Carolyn had been painting in Morocco
                    with my French friend, Marielle Chienwa, who was very helpful in finding models
                    for her. Some of her paintings were to appear in the magazine Le Official. We
                    had pleasant walks in the little forest nearby and took the boat over to Dinard
                    and I had a lemonade on the terrace of the Royal Hotel where the atmosphere was
                    more English than French.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>My French teacher, Madame Nuet, invited me one evening to a Japanese sukiyaki
                    dinner at her home. It was truly a Japanese affair. Among the Japanese men were
                    two correspondences for their papers in Paris. And an artist who told me all of
                    his beautiful things illustrated in a French magazine had been stolen from an
                    apartment during the war. One of the four Japanese girls was Miss Sudahara, who
                    later I heard sing in Japanese in the opera “Madame Butterfly.” The rest of the
                    cast sang in French. The opera house was packed and everyone applauded again and
                    again. She was a tremendous success. I always weep at this opera, although I
                    have heard it several times. It is so sad.</p>
                <p>Madame Marchand, the French teacher at the embassy and her daughter were also at
                    the party as they too had lived in Japan. It was a nostalgic evening reminiscing
                    about Japan and trying to remember what little of the Japanese language I once
                    knew.</p>
                <p>One Sunday while Margaret Truman was in Paris, she presented a flag from Missouri
                    at the Cathedral. When I arrived at the church, one of the ushers that I knew
                    seated me up front and just across the aisle from Ambassador and Mrs. Dunn and
                    Margaret and her friend, Miss Synder. When she presented the flag, she looked up
                    into the face of the pastor with a charming smile and the frankest look out of
                    her eyes. She was very gracious and had become very popular in Paris.</p>
                <p>I was so glad when Jay Owens came to my desk one day. A chap I had not seen or
                    heard of since we were both bombed in Honolulu. He wanted to resume his antique
                    business and was looking for an apartment. A few days later he brought around
                    his friend, Blevins Davis, who invited me to go on a cruise with them through
                    the Mediterranean on his yacht. Unfortunately I couldn't at that time. Jay said
                    Blevins almost married Margaret Truman.</p>
                <p>Mrs. John Hubbard was back in Paris with her lawyer, Mr. McGuinness and his wife,
                    and we all went to Rumplemeyer's not for tea but their delicious chocolate
                    sodas. She had come to get some of the things she had given Moi Maison at the
                    Saint Rugn. She had given the only priceless Napoleonic things out of storage.
                    She lent me a book by Nordhoff-Hall, whom she knew when we were both in Tahiti
                    and in which he described a pension where I had stayed.</p>
                <p>Count Dillon had at last received an assignment to Guatemala with the
                    organization WHO and was in Paris for a few days, as was Andre. The three of us
                    dined together at La Truite, our favorite restaurant, and had our favorite dish,
                    turbot, which they did so well. The next day Dillon and I lunched together and
                    Andre joined us for tea, then came to my room for champagne...</p>
                <p>Biskra, Algeria, December 27, 1953.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>We visited some old Roman ruins at Timgad on route here and now I must read
                    “Salambo” by the French writer Gustave Flaubert. He describes the life of this
                    period so well. We lunched at Batna, then immediately began the desert. I was
                    interested to read the Sahara is as big or bigger than our entire United States.
                    Vegetation became scarcer and goat herds were replaced by small camel caravans.
                    After driving for miles through this steppe land we came to a huge gorge called
                    El Kantaoui. After passing through it a lovely little oasis appeared. A stream
                    with tall palms growing on other side. Then we came upon three typical little
                    Arab villages, White Village, Black Village and Red Village, so called because
                    of the color when the sun shines on them. Just as the sun was setting we could
                    see in the distance a larger oasis which was Biskra, a winter resort made famous
                    by Robert Hichens' book, “The Garden of Allah,” which I had tucked under my arm
                    during the trip. This hotel is something like the Mamauina at Marrakech on a
                    smaller scale. The guide took us to see the Dervishes last night. They were of a
                    certain tribe who live in the mountains and stick knives through themselves. We
                    went into sort of a dugout where some Arabs were squatting on the floor playing
                    a flute, and big tambourines. The black man performing was dressed in a woman's
                    dress with colored shawls wound around his head, and worked himself up to a
                    trance reminding me of the shimmy of the twenties in my boarding school days.
                    Then a lone man brought out several very slender knives. The Dervish stood
                    directly in front of me while he pierced one straight through his cheeks,
                    another through his tongue and another through his chin. I really couldn't look
                    at him for long, it was too horrible and turned my head. Then he lit a torch and
                    passed it up and down over his body between his skirt and stomach, all the time
                    jumping up and down chanting. Then he pulled out two large scorpions and began
                    to play with them. This was the last and final act for which I was most
                    grateful. We all paid 250 francs to see this horror and tipped the Dervish 20
                    francs. They say it really is not a fake, it is considered a penitence to Allah.
                    Needless to say I was relieved to have it all over.</p>
                <p>The guide then took us around the town a bit. Very shabby. Down the street were
                    the Ouled Na�ls, compared to the geisha girls of Japan. The next day we drove
                    over a very rocky road to a most beautiful oasis called M'Chou Neche. When we
                    arrived we were surrounded by little Arab boys. We soon learned why. Going up
                    the gorge was a bit precarious climbing over slippery stones crossing the little
                    stream so we needed them to take our hand to help us. It was like a dream being
                    in that exquisite ravine with green palm trees on either side. I could now
                    understand what an oasis in a desert really means. We passed the nomads in their
                    tents on the way to some sand dunes. We were told that the Arabs sometimes in
                    very hot weather bury themselves in the sand leaving only their heads exposed
                    for several hours for 21 days to cure their rheumatism.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>We passed a curious Arab cemetery. Each little mound was just a heap of stones,
                    nothing more. Of course not a single flower in sight. Just what you would expect
                    a cemetery to be in the Sahara. Then we visited the famous garden of Allah.
                    Still with the book tucked under my arm it seemed more romantic than the book.
                    But it was natural that it had changed since the book was published in 1909. The
                    charming house, the Landau, still stands but very deserted. There are dates in
                    abundance and sold in an artistic way on the branch and also oranges. The flies
                    are rather numerous and I had forgotten how the Arab dogs bark at night.</p>
                <p>Hotel Du Caid, Bou Saada, Algeria, December 29, 1953.</p>
                <p>This is a tiny Arab village on the edge of the Sahara. It is cooler than Biskra
                    and more appealing perhaps because of the hotel which is utterly charming and
                    popular with Europeans because it is just three hours from Alger. It is
                    furnished with the same type of taste found in small select hotel like
                    Whispering Sands in Florida and the Halekulani in Honolulu. Of course with a
                    completely Moorish atmosphere. At night it is dimly lit by brass Moorish lamps
                    of different colored glass. There is a small garden with chairs where palms,
                    cactus, pepper trees and geraniums are trying their best to grow in the little
                    oasis. And now a swimming pool is being installed. It must have been gay at
                    Christmas because there was a Christmas tree still standing.</p>
                <p>We arrived for lunch and afterwards had my first camel ride in the desert each
                    one with an Arab boy directing the camel and at the same time trying to sell his
                    colorful knives. But a camel is agonizing to ride. It is a lyrical beast with a
                    stride like an ostrich and its peculiar gait with its unconventional rocking
                    movement can be torment for a novice, such as I was. But at least I learned to
                    sing “giddyap” in Arabic before I got off.</p>
                <p>After dinner we went to see the famous Ouled Na�ls dance. They are Arab
                    prostitutes and wear gay colored costumes as simple as an inverted sack with
                    lots of gold bracelets and gold coins around their necks. The tiny room was
                    filled with Europeans. They sang and danced to instruments that have not changed
                    in 500 years. The girls seemed to be about 15 or 16 and made the most
                    extraordinary movements with their stomachs, jerking it up and down to the
                    rhythm of the Arabic music, then moved their necks and heads like Polynesian
                    dancers. By paying 150 francs more we could see the same dance done in the nude.
                    They then appeared only in their earrings and necklaces. The orchestra turned
                    their backs on this performance which seemed ironical as the flutist was blind
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>Hotel Saint George, Alger, Algeria, December 30, 1953:</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>This hotel is perfectly lovely and it looks as if it might have been an old
                    palace at one time with exquisite colored tiles everywhere and beautiful Moorish
                    wood carvings. My delightful room overlooked the garden and sea. I am sailing
                    tomorrow at noon and will be reluctant to return to civilization. I have so
                    loved the Sahara. The vast impenetrable desert has cosmic beauty which cannot
                    even be imagined by those who have never visited it. The Arab is very much in
                    tune with nature and the desert. He likes to call the Garden of Allah...and his
                    religion is like rich oriental tapestry unfathomable.</p>
                <p>Back in Paris, on the 5th of April I celebrated my 50th birthday. Andre sent a
                    telegram. Pauline (Inaudible) invited me to the Crillon for lunch and gave me a
                    bottle of Carven's “MaGriff” and a pair of gloves. When I returned to the hotel
                    I found a box of Rumplemeyer's chocolates from Princess Fifi and her husband,
                    Jacque Olivetti. Then I went to a cocktail party at Yvonne St. Leger's. She was
                    now living in a penthouse with a wide terrace. And my young friend, Hugh Cope,
                    presented me his photograph taken with the Queen Mother, who visited his school
                    at Tonbridge. It was taken while he was sculpturing a horse. The day ended
                    happily by dining with Beris and Dimitri.</p>
                <p>It was exciting to receive news the next day that I was to have home leave and
                    transfer to Bangkok. I hastily read the post report and it sounded fascinating.
                    Three seasons—hot, cool, rainy—and only cottons worn because it is a hot
                    country. Just what I had been longing for. The process of getting cool when one
                    is hot is much more pleasant than the effort of trying to get warm when it is
                    cold. So I was delighted with my next assignment. When Carolyn Evera, my artist
                    friend, heard the news, she too was excited and said, “I will come and visit
                    you. Where is it?” I laughed and said, “In Siam.” I thought it more romantic
                    sounding than Thailand.</p>
                <p>Then I began to wonder what would happen to my precious pony. He would never
                    support the long voyage and the hot climate and I couldn't support his
                    transportation. Unfortunately he could not go at government expense or be
                    claimed as a dependent. Nor could I ship him as personal effects. It broke my
                    heart to do it, but I sold him to Gager, and heard later he became a circus pony
                    in Italy. Gager had already begun to train him to stand on his hind legs for
                    sugar before I left Paris.</p>
                <p>I hoped I could leave Paris as soon as possible to reach my father in Pasadena,
                    California in time to celebrate his 85th birthday and to reach Bangkok before
                    the rainy season came. In the midst of all my happiness I was sorry to read of
                    the death of the Crown Princess Martha of Norway, remembering so well the day I
                    met her in Washington, DC. It was during the war and when the Norwegian national
                    anthem was played I was so moved tears fell into my champagne glass so my toast
                    to her was very salty.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Over the Easter holidays I went to England to say goodbye to some friends and see
                    some good shows. London was not expensive in those days and fortunately I could
                    squeeze in three shows in one afternoon and evening. The seats were not over two
                    and a half each. As I was now assigned to Bangkok, I felt I must get a ticket to
                    see “The King and I,” and I did. The thought that I would soon be in Siam
                    thrilled me. I went to a matinee. At 5:30pm I went to see “The Boy Friend” that
                    had been receiving raves in reviews. A musical of the twenties which took me
                    back to my boarding school days when we wore cloche hats and long waisted
                    dresses and did the Charleston. It was so much fun sitting there alone giggling
                    to myself. Then I had time for a bowl of soup before going on to the 8:30
                    performance of “The Confidential Clerk,” a most subtle play. My English friends
                    were highly amused and said, “That sets some sort of a record and I probably
                    would be mixing up the 'King' with the 'Boy Friend' and the 'Boy Friend' with
                    the 'Confidential Clerk.'” I didn't.</p>
                <p>My Bermudian friend, Sheila Green, was now living with her father in Tunbridge
                    Wells where I had luncheon with them. While there a huge bouquet of Easter
                    lilies were flown in from Bermuda bringing back happy memories of our friendship
                    there. Sheila had shown me Knole House, the famous Sackville home, when she met
                    me at Sevenoaks earlier in the day.</p>
                <p>Then I went on a tour. The first night was spent at Bath, an ancient spa. The
                    bathes used in the Roman times were still there and had been popular in the
                    Edwardian era. It had a wealth of distinguished Georgian houses arranged on
                    terraces, squares and crescents. We passed through magnificent Cheddar Gorge.
                    They do not make the cheese there anymore since the war. Wells Cathedral had a
                    lovely moot around the Bishop's Palace where the swans rang a little bell when
                    hungry and someone fed them crumbs from a window. Glastonbury Abbey, not in
                    complete ruins was a legendary burial place of King Arthur and where Joseph
                    Arimathaea brought a chalice and Christianity was first started and where the
                    Glastonbury Thorn grows.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>We spend the next night at Bude on a fine stretch of sands and wonderful coastal
                    scenery. Then the next day drove through Cornwall where I had a brief chat at
                    the Cathedral with Sister Emily, a nun I had visited weekly when we both lived
                    in Japan and it was refreshing to see her again. We lunched at Penzance, then on
                    to Land's End, the furthermost part of England where all the signs read, “This
                    is the first, last hotel in England” or “This is the first and last post office
                    in England.” It became amusing when a father was overheard saying to his young
                    son, “Now that is the first and last ice cream you are going to have.” We could
                    see St. Michael's Mount from Penzance resembling so much Mont Saint Michel in
                    France. It was the most picturesque place. At Newquay, we had delicious Cornwall
                    cream on our scones for tea, but we could not get any of the famous Devonshire
                    cream, that too had not been made since the war. The next day came to Clovelly,
                    an adorable place on a steep hill overlooking the sea. Then through the Lorna
                    Doone country to Lynmouth and Lynton where an awful flood occurred years ago.
                    They were changing the course of the river now to prevent another. At Porlock we
                    saw where the prize winning horse people, Captain Llewellyn and Pat Smith,
                    lived. I remember seeing them at the horse show in Paris. The towns were quaint
                    with thatched roof houses and wild ponies roamed the moors. We spent two nights
                    at Exeter. The Cathedral was beautiful. Torquay was considered a fashionable spa
                    but I preferred Bournemouth. Devon was charming country. Plymouth interested me
                    because of the plaques that marked the place where the Pilgrims started on their
                    voyage to America. The flowers, especially daffodils, were everywhere, so
                    beautifully arranged in the lounge of the hotels where we stayed. We passed so
                    many places evoking memories of Sir Walter Raleigh, Turner the writer and the
                    poets Keats and Byron, and, of course, King Arthur, William the Conqueror and
                    King George III. I fell in love with Christ Church. Then we came to the New
                    Forest where we fed the ponies. We spent our last night at Burley Manor, an old
                    Tudor mansion in the heart of the New Forest. It was so quiet, restful and
                    lovely, I could have stayed forever. On the return to London visited the
                    cathedral town of Winchester and saw King Arthur's famous round table.</p>
                <p>It was about 5:30pm when I reached the Cumberland, a new modern hotel run with
                    American efficiency at Marble Arch in London. I quickly changed to have dinner
                    with a friend I had not seen since we were children, Virginia Fairly, who was
                    now on British “Vogue” and married to a distinguished Englishman champion. She
                    had also kindly invited another childhood friend, Blan Tucker, also married to
                    an Englishman, very attractive and amusing. A letter I found was describing him.
                    She said, Selby was awarded the George Cross in 1941 and in 1942 the George
                    Medal in his work in connection with the German magnetic mines. So secret was
                    the work at this time that when he received his decoration from the King at
                    Buckingham Palace, he was obliged to answer the King's inquiries as to the
                    nature of his job with “Sorry, Sire, I am afraid I can't tell you.” I have some
                    photographs taken on that day with Selby's sister and myself present in our
                    quite ridiculous dolly hats that were then the fashion, clutching our gas masks.
                    It all seems a very long time ago.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Elizabeth Keith, a well known English artist, invited me for a delicious luncheon
                    at the Washington Hotel. We had met in Honolulu where she asked if I would like
                    to exhibit her woodblock prints she did while living in Japan and Korea. I did
                    with pleasure and took them to the other islands when on holiday and was very
                    successful. The Queen Mother had bought 20 when they were exhibited in London.
                    After luncheon we went to her apartment for coffee which was filled with English
                    antiques. Before I left she presented me with a 200 year old English cup of bone
                    china, which I treasure to this day, as well as three of her books she
                    autographed while living in Honolulu.</p>
                <p>I have always found great rapport with the English. I fine them so sincere and
                    spiritual and so well read and well breed which is reflected even in the tones
                    of their voices. But the moment I stepped off the plane in Paris, I felt the
                    joie de vivre of France. The appreciation of the varying atmosphere in foreign
                    countries leaves a deep impression.</p>
                <p>Then the days became crowded with preparations for home leave. At last the clouds
                    of packing paper and excelsior disappeared and I was ready to depart with ten
                    pieces of luggage and five bottles of champagne and a wicker hamper, which I was
                    obliged by regulations to hand carry up the gang plank. Marcel, Beris and Fifi
                    saw me off at the boat train. I felt sad to leave my friends in France. After
                    four years I had developed a pontshon for that country.</p>
                <p>Upon the tenure of my duties at the embassy I was pleased to have added to my
                    file two nice letters of commendation.</p>
                <p>I crossed in the United States which remained the pride of the United States
                    Merchant fleet for 17 years having received the blue ribbon for the fastest
                    liner in the world. Only a few days were spent in New York. I wanted to get over
                    to the UN to find out what the representative from Siam was talking about. Most
                    of my friends were out of town. In Washington, I reported for consultation and
                    for arrangements for onward transportation with Becky Sanford, who was my
                    friendly liaison with the Department. I did reach Pasadena, as I so hoped I
                    would, to celebrate my dear father's 85th birthday with him and with the Moul
                    Chando French champagne I had so carefully carried all the way with such loving
                    care. Our partings were becoming more poignant, perhaps because his life span
                    was growing shorter and shorter, and we took our leave of each other with
                    considerable signs of affection. I telephoned him twice before I sailed.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>After a pleasant weekend in Burlingame with my Honolulu friend, Barbara Bowen
                    Nicholas, George, her publisher husband, kindly drove me up to San Francisco to
                    take my ship. I was invited to the Press Club for luncheon and I had dinner with
                    an old friend, Mary Campbell. We talked until after midnight. She had read in
                    the paper that Bob Six, who had married my dear Briar Cliffs school chum, Anriet
                    Earhart, and divorced her and married the actress, Ethel Merman, were divorced.
                    Some years later Anriet confided in me, she just couldn't keep up with Merman.
                    Some other friends took me to the Top of the Mark for luncheon from where I
                    could see my ship, the President Cleveland, laying along side the quay which I
                    later boarded bedecked with orchids Barbara and George sent. The photograph
                    appeared in the Pasadena paper of me beaming because I was going out to my next
                    post with great joy and excitement and determination to do my job as well as
                    could possibly be done.</p>
                <p>On August 5, 1953, it was a gay sailing. Music and serpentine. There appeared to
                    be quite a few orientals aboard and it seemed to me half were Foreign Service
                    and half missionaries, ninety children but few men. Not that I minded, but some
                    women do. My roommate was a civilian employee of the Department of Army going to
                    Japan. A very agreeable girl and I was pleased she didn't smoke. Sitting next to
                    me at the table in the dining room was Pauline Law going to.....</p>
                <p>Across from me were the Corcorans. He was going as a vice consul to the Japanese
                    island of Kyushu. Then there was a White Russian and two elderly ladies on the
                    orient cruise. Mr. Taylor, who is consul general in Tokyo, was also aboard with
                    his wife and daughter. The Captain was the friendliness I have ever encountered
                    on any ship. Life aboard seemed much less formal than on the transatlantic
                    crossings. Perhaps because we were in warmer waters.</p>
                <p>I was up early to see dear old Diamond Head as we approached. Standing at the end
                    of the dock with leis to greet me was Alice Poole of the Art Academy with whom I
                    once lived in her Japanese house, Seiko-So, in Manoa Valley. We embraced with
                    affection. Honolulu was just as everyone said. I would never recognize it since
                    the bombing which I witnessed on that fatal day on December 7, 1941. Tall
                    buildings, hotels, apartments, shops everywhere and much more traffic. I felt
                    like Rip Van Winkle. The day was spent shopping for cottons, cocktailing with
                    Louie and George of Vickers and then dining at the Willows, Polynesian type
                    place where we had mahi mahi fish native to the island beside a lovely pool
                    where we could see the reflection of the plumeria, ginger and willows as they
                    hung gracefully over it. Had a long conversation with Alice Spaulding Bowen and
                    remarked about the lovely Japanese heirlooms she had given to Barbara's home.
                    She was doing so much for the island to beautify it. Afterwards they drove me
                    down to the ship. It had been a heavenly day to see dear friends again and to be
                    on that lovely island once more. There were hundreds to see the ship sail. Again
                    music played while the hula girls danced and passengers and friends held tight
                    to the serpentine. Sailings from Honolulu are never without emotions.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>We lost Friday the 13th by crossing the international date line. A good day to
                    lose. At the costume ball I went as the Statue of Liberty swathed in a sheet
                    with cigarettes adorning my crown, with red paper tucked in a champagne carton
                    turned upside down. Some of the costumes were screamingly funny. The ex-Prince
                    of Japan, Hiroshi Fushi, Hirohito's nephew, who boarded at Honolulu came to sit
                    at our table. He was a very charming young man returning to Japan after four
                    years in the United States. He had been studying at a college in Danville,
                    Kentucky, for the diplomatic service and told me he hoped to be sent to London.
                    When I asked him if he knew my Japanese friends, the Hirookas, his friend spoke
                    up and said Mrs. Hirooka was his aunt and that they were now living in Shukugawa
                    the suburb between Kobe and Osaka where I once lived on the compound with my
                    husband who was an executive at the National City Bank there. They also told me
                    Tom Davis, who was in our wedding party, was now manager of the Bank in
                    Yokohama. So many memories were now sweeping over me as we were approaching the
                    country where I was married 24 years ago.</p>
                <p>We were in a slight typhoon for two or three days and finally an announcement
                    came over the loud speaker, “Due to weather conditions, the port of Yokohama is
                    closed to shipping. Therefore docking time will depend on the improvement of the
                    weather.” We had been up since six to go ashore and it became very tiresome
                    waiting for the storm to subside and tantalizing to see the shoreline with the
                    tall buildings over the white caps through the heavy fog and mist. But it was a
                    beautiful bright warm day after the typhoon which held us up a day and I drove
                    especially to Kamakura to see the centuries old Daibutsu which is so revered by
                    the Japanese and where I first fell in love with Japan nearly a quarter of a
                    century ago. At that time one drove through typical little Japanese villages to
                    get to Kamakura which is beautifully situated on the beach. Since the war it has
                    become more of a suburb than a summer resort for people couldn't find enough
                    houses at Yokohama and Tokyo to live in.</p>
                <p>Due to the typhoon my stay was shortened by a day in Hong Kong but I was still
                    able to make the scheduled flight to Bangkok on August 28. The consulate, which
                    is just across from the Helena Mai where I stayed in 1930 for six months, sent a
                    Mr. and Mrs. McIlory to meet me and take me to my hotel. Again, it was like old
                    times to be back at the Peninsula Hotel on Kowloon and have flowers in the room
                    from the management. It was from my bedroom window in this very hotel in
                    February, 1939 I had watched Richard Halliburton the adventurer, set sail in his
                    colorful Chinese junk, The Sea Dragon and when he later returned for repairs I
                    met him. Then when he set sail again on that ill-fated boat he perished in a
                    storm and was never found. He had died as he always said he wanted to with his
                    seven league boots on. I went around to see if there would be anyone in the
                    National City Bank I might know and found the manager, Mr. Griffith, who had
                    lived with Charlie in Peking in 1928. My last evening in Hong Kong was
                    delightfully spent with Helen Burton who invited me for dinner to her apartment
                    high on the peak with a gorgeous view. It belonged to Mr. McBain, who I remember
                    having my deck chair next to on one of my crossings to Europe. Helen Burton
                    lived for years in Peking and had a shop, the Camel Bell.....</p>

                <p>...when there in 1933 and where she was interned by the Communists and her four
                    adopted Chinese daughters are still here. This had been a nostalgic journey and
                    now I was flying off into another part of the world to my next assignment
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>August 28, 1954.</p>
                <p>It was a wonderful flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok. We took off at 11:30am and
                    soon saw submerged below some of the most exquisite, emerald colored islands
                    looking like distinct volcanoes. Then we flew over Indo-China. Maxim's luncheon
                    was served, but not the champagne, red wine. Sitting next to me was an
                    attractive young man who said his name was Bob Doherty going to Bangkok for the
                    first time to be with Caltech. He mentioned during the course of conversation
                    that his grandfather had been our ambassador to the Balkans during the Second
                    World War. As we approached Bangkok we looked down upon flat, green, flooded
                    rice paddies with borders of trees along the sides of the small box-like
                    plantations. It was raining but just before we landed it cleared as we
                    disembarked. I had traveled almost half way around the world to arrive at the
                    very heart of the East, Siam.</p>
                <p>John Lloyd, III, a scholarly looking young man with glasses, met me at the
                    airport with his wife and little baby and had no trouble going through customs
                    with my special passport. Mr. Lloyd said he was the vice consul and “we” were
                    the consular section and began briefing me as we drove the 16 miles into
                    Bangkok. He said they use the embassy, which actually was raised to an embassy
                    in March, 1947, as a training ground for vice consuls because there are such a
                    varieties of duties. A Thai young man does all the visa work of the office. I
                    will be known as the secretary and citizenship clerk. So on me devolves the task
                    of issuing passports and was grateful I had received that experience for there
                    would be other duties I would need to learn such as clearing with the foreign
                    office for the arrival and departures of the American ships and planes and
                    taking registration of births and some correspondence. The hours were from
                    7:30am to 12:00 noon and from 1:00pm to 4:30pm with Saturday and Sunday free.The
                    Lloyds drove me to the American Club where Jonan Malik, my Persian friend, had
                    suggested staying. And I was so glad he did because a great many of the embassy
                    personnel were staying there and to whom I was introduced at once. It was
                    managed by an American with the name of Herman Siler, who was a former attach�
                    at the embassy. It had originally been the home of a Thai princess built in
                    tropical style with a wide screened in veranda where there were big comfortable
                    cretonne covered wicker chairs and a little bar which looked out upon a long
                    sweeping lawn to lotus filled ponds. About six people sit at one table and are
                    served by Chinese boys as the servants are generally called in the East even if
                    decrepit old men.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>We actually live in small connecting quarters. It does have hot water but not
                    much privacy because there are only screens at the windows. The rooms were
                    furnished with fans, flit guns filled daily to ward off the mosquitoes. There
                    were no telephones in the rooms, only one in the main building. For this and
                    with three meals a day, I paid $6.42. The rate of exchange fluctuates daily, but
                    on arrival the rate was 21.50 baht to the dollar. The only riverside hotel and a
                    favorite established in 1885 was the Oriental which charged $14 per day just for
                    the room and bath.</p>
                <p>The room I was taken to rather stunned me by its moldy spots on the walls. Mrs.
                    Lloyd made a point of seeing that I would be removed to a better room the next
                    day, which I very much appreciated. About four little frogs were about to leap
                    into my room when I returned to it after dinner on Saturday evening making me a
                    bit squeamish. I was really glad to see the light of Sunday morning and was
                    awakened by the shrill shrieks of the priest birds. They say they summon the
                    priest to matins promptly at daylight when the early coolness is an enchanted
                    part of the day, when there is a particular freshness in contrast to the heat
                    and humidity. So I decided to go to my Episcopal church about three miles from
                    here on Convent Road and called a taxi. The church was open on all sides and I
                    enjoyed our service very much and met the padre, The Rev. Folk, afterwards. When
                    I asked someone how to get a taxi, this charming man appeared and said, “I'll
                    take you home. I am Mr. Kent with the British embassy,” and introduced his wife.
                    We both sat in the back seat of his attractive car and he immediately apologized
                    for the appearance of the men in the church for not wearing neckties. “No one
                    does here, “ he explained, “It is just too hot.” I did find it hot and sticky.
                    As this was the rainy season the grounds around the Club were like little swamps
                    and the water dripped languidly from the trees. The congs are awfully smelly,
                    muddy, stagnant and unhealthy looking at this time of year. Snakes crawl out of
                    them onto the grounds. But in the morning they are bright with beautiful colored
                    water lilies which give a charming appearance from a distance.</p>
                <p>It is quiet and peaceful around the Club grounds and I am sure more pleasant than
                    staying in a hotel. The only riverside hotel and a favorite established in 1885
                    is the Oriental but just for a room and bath charge $14. They are trying to
                    arrange it so that the congs will be diverted through pipes and in this way
                    widen the road so there is much construction going on. We passed several small
                    elephants on the road and lots of water buffalos helping in the cultivation of
                    the land. One rides in three-wheeled motorized cabs called “samlars.” When
                    passing the city's main Buddhist monastery, the taxi drivers lift their hands
                    off the wheel to make a prayer like gesture of respect known as the wai with
                    palms flattened against each other before their chin and with deep genuflection
                    it is executed with much grace.</p>
                <p>I decided faced with traffic jams of elephants and samlars and inadequate roads,
                    it was no place for my ponies from Paris. The people, themselves, are their own
                    beast of burden carrying everything on their heads, but so gentle and sweet.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Sunday afternoon I was delighted when one of the men at the Club associated with
                    STEM, military assistance program, asked if I would like to go on a little
                    sightseeing tour. He had his company car and chauffeur, so we drove to the
                    Temple of Dawn, or more properly called Wat Arun. It was of the most amazing
                    type of exquisite decorations and one had to look carefully to fully appreciate
                    the detail. The flowers were all made of colorful broken pieces of china. We
                    climbed as high as we could in the hot sun. A Buddhist priest in his bright
                    yellow saffron robe from India joined us and could speak a little English as
                    well as Burmese, Laotian, Cambodian and Thai. Some other people came along and
                    said that when Douglas Fairbanks was here he climbed all the way to the top
                    which was quite a feat, even for him considering the height and steepness of the
                    temple, but found a fantastic view for across the river was the royal palace. It
                    was a panorama of color like a theatrical extravaganza. The dazzling domed
                    temples and the upsweep of the roofs give a sense of joyousness, a reflection of
                    the country itself, for the Thai are a joyous, smiling people.</p>
                <p>Every Sunday evening there is a buffet supper served on the veranda followed by a
                    film. This Sunday, “Titanic” was shown. It was griping but the reels kept
                    breaking intermittently. Every American with children connected with the embassy
                    and some of the other government agencies are staying at the Club until they
                    find more permanent quarters.</p>
                <p>The breakfast table is always adorned with a bowl of exotic fruits—fresh
                    pineapples, bananas, papayas, mangosteens and mangoes and some I don't yet know
                    the name of.</p>
                <p>Mr. Howard Parsons is charg� d'affaires until the new ambassador, Mr. Puerifoy
                    arrives, who is in Guatemala. I was taken around to meet everyone and so pleased
                    to have the opportunity of working so close with the head of the consular
                    section. The vice consul is only about 24 but I will get a good grounding in all
                    of the work here. I was pleased to receive the periodic increase effective July
                    4. Several Americans have come in from the Services including the Caltech chap
                    who sat next to me on the plane from Hong Kong to here.</p>
                <p>Then, one day a delightful person, Mrs. Berrington came in when she learned
                    Charlie Biddle was with the National City Bank as was her son who had been in
                    Osaka with Tom Davis, now manager there, and who had been in our wedding party,
                    and immediately and most enthusiastically said, “We must get together.” And so
                    we did and became dear friends.</p>
                <p>Mr. Griffith in the Hong Kong branch of the National City Bank of New York had
                    given me a note to Mr. Lewis T. E. Davis, who was the manager of the Bank of
                    America here and who had known Charlie in London on his first assignment with
                    the Bank then known as the International Banking Corporation. The world seem to
                    be getting smaller and smaller.</p>
                <p>I heard my effects had arrived from Paris and were in storage. I particularly
                    wanted my cottons. I had already shed my hose and shoes for sandals.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Carolyn Strong was telling me about a trip to Angkor Wat that was being organized
                    by a group of National Geographic people off the brigantine Yankee that was in
                    port and it aroused my interest. It seemed like a very good opportunity to go
                    for it would it would be less expensive than one of the package tours that go
                    only once a month and cost $80. They planned to go on a Tuesday and return on a
                    Thursday. Mr. Lloyd was very willing for me to take it so I did and wrote my
                    family as follows:</p>
                <p>“Grand Hotel, Angkor, Siem Reap, Cambodia, September 7, 1954.</p>
                <p>I have been up since twenty to four this morning. The embassy car called at
                    4:30am having picked up another girl, Dorothy Moffat, in charge of the files. We
                    were nearly to the airport when the car ran out of gas. There we sat in pitch
                    black darkness. A truck finally came along and the driver suggested we go with
                    him. I said, “No,” not knowing who the driver might be at that hour. So he was
                    sent for gas. When he returned our driver discovered he didn't have the key to
                    the gas tank due probably to the fact that the Thai drivers had been stealing
                    gas from the cars' tanks. So the truck drove on and I locked the doors of the
                    back seat where we were and waved my hand out of the front door window at the
                    next car that came along. Luckily it was a car with two American officers with
                    MAAG who took us safely to the airport.</p>
                <p>The flight over was perfect and we have had beautiful weather. These ruins are
                    too marvelous for words. Dorothy and I had brought sandwiches for lunch so that
                    we all of the others who came along returned to the hotel we stayed out to eat
                    them rather than have to go back to the hotel for the long tiresome French lunch
                    and siesta that lasted until 4:00pm.</p>
                <p>Tonight at dinner we ordered champagne thinking it would be so cheap here, but
                    not so. Twice cats came to my table. A big black one suddenly jumped into my lap
                    and frightened me so I upset my champagne glass and spilled all the precious
                    contents. The smart French put coasters over their wine glasses to keep out the
                    bugs. And the food was not too good. In spite of all this, I was enjoying the
                    trip immensely finding my knowledge of French very useful as I seemed to be the
                    only one speaking French among the Americans. We will spend tomorrow here and
                    leave early Thursday for Phnom Penh and fly back to Bangkok from there. More
                    about the trip when I return.”</p>

                <p>“I sent you a very brief letter from Angkor so you would know I had reached there
                    safely. Do save the stamps for they will be welcomed by some collector. I feel
                    so fortunate to have this opportunity to go over there and for less than the
                    usual trip would cost and saw a lot more. For several years Captain and Mrs.
                    Irving Johnson had been taking the brigantine Yankee, a year and a half to go,
                    around the world. Lecturing and showing pictures like Burton Homes. Also have
                    written three books. Mrs. Johnson will have one ready for the press when they
                    return. Anyone can go by paying $4,680 and they go to all of these fascinating
                    out of the way places. Everyone does something on the ship. One girl said, “I'm
                    the barber.” All of their many interesting experiences..........</p>
                <p>...Mrs. Donovan, sailed today with them as far as Bali. The other passengers were
                    two Frenchmen, one from South America, one English chap and a Mrs. Anderson,
                    friend of Mrs. Donovan, who had taken a similar trip twenty years ago. The round
                    trip from Bangkok to Angkor Wat and to Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia and
                    back to Bangkok was $60. The room at the Grand Hotel was about $20 and our
                    dinner $1. We flew Thai Airways and had the prettiest little Thai hostess. When
                    I asked her if we would see Angkor Wat from the air before landing she said she
                    would speak to the pilot. So we circled it twice, what a thrill. It was cooler
                    there than Bangkok, that is to say, less hot. It took us one hour and a half
                    from Bangkok and found more vegetation there. In fact, a mild jungle. We checked
                    into the hotel upon arrival and then took a bus to see these fabulous temples.
                    We went to Bayon first which is the one with the face on it. Then to Angkor
                    Thom. We had a samlar ride which are like little Victorian carriages drawn by a
                    man pedaling a bicycle and are just large enough for two. We were joined by the
                    others at Angkor Wat and the bas-relief on the walls was the highlight here. But
                    I really preferred some of the other temples showing the enormous trees growing
                    from them, just like it all must have been before the French started restoring
                    them in 1907. I had no idea they would be so extensive. We took several tours to
                    many more than the regular tour go. The guide's French was better than his
                    English so I could follow and use my knowledge of French to good advantage.</p>
                <p>Dad, dear, these amazing temples built by the Khmer people from the 9th, 10th and
                    11th centuries are truly one of the wonders of the world. Nearly everyone had
                    elaborate movie cameras. I felt like such an amateur coming along snapping with
                    my little Brownie.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>We flew to Phnom Penh the early morning of Thursday which took about an hour.
                    There we had a tour through the King's palace and saw some of his priceless
                    possessions in the museum. He is about 36 and a bachelor, but the guide tells me
                    they all want their independence. He is due to come to Bangkok soon. I also
                    heard that it is very easy to have an audience with him, but one would have to
                    stay about a week there to make the necessary arrangements. But as the planes
                    don't usually go there, one probably has to go from Saigon. As I have seven more
                    days I have to take before the end of the year, I must plan another holiday
                    soon. I hear Burma is the place to get rubies so I shall like to go there. I
                    found in Cambodia a pair of bookends, sitting statues of Vishnu in black bronze,
                    and a white silk stole threaded with gold. We arrived in Bangkok about 7:00pm
                    Thursday and was so tired went to bed without dinner.</p>
                <p>The next day Dorothy and I thought we would like to see Irving Johnson's
                    brigantine Yankee sail, but the embassy chauffeur couldn't find the East Asiatic
                    wharf where they were tied up. Traffic, which is terrific here, delayed us.
                    Well, we arrived finally at the dock but the yacht had sailed. I thought I saw
                    in the distance the mast head looming up over the horizon, but that was all. We
                    came tearing back to the embassy in a samlar. This time he rode a motorcycle and
                    I was so relieved when the embassy appeared in sight. We only have an hour at
                    noon for lunch and I had eaten a sandwich at my desk and drank a coke in order
                    to go.</p>
                <p>I had the most delightful day Sunday. Mrs. Barrington called for me and we went
                    to the church service together. Then she took me to the Sports Club. There were
                    a lot of people sitting around the pool to whom she introduced us. Colonel
                    Phelps joined our table and when I was introduced to him he said, “Oh, you are
                    the sparkplug the padre was telling us about.” Not knowing what he could be
                    possibly talking about, I said, “What?” Then he explained how impressed he was
                    that I had been only a day in Bangkok when I searched out the church and came to
                    the 8:00 service. I laughed and thought nothing of it.</p>
                <p>Colonel Phelps is with the Military Assistance program here and very
                    attractive.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Barrington and I swam the full length of the 300 foot pool and back again,
                    then had beer and sandwiches under an umbrella at the side of the pool. It was
                    lovely and I am going to join. There is also a race track there with a golf
                    course on the inside, but the races are not on now due to the rainy season.</p>
                <p>American Embassy, Bangkok, September 20, 1954</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Since I last wrote to you I have been working very hard. I wonder Dad, if there
                    was much in your California papers about a young 19 year old boy from Los
                    Angeles who came out here to Bangkok to be a Buddhist priest. His family wrote
                    us to try to find him as he was about to marry a Thai girl and have him come
                    home as his mother was very ill. So Mr. Lloyd was in charge of locating him. He
                    was out of the office quite a bit. One day he was gone nearly all day for the
                    boy had committed suicide and the girl tried to but did not die. The Bangkok
                    papers were full of it and we are all wondering how the California press played
                    it up. Mr. Lloyd took the Thai clerk from the office with him to interpret which
                    left me there along. Then came ten Thai officers who needed visas immediately.
                    It was not my job, so two vice consuls and two other girls came in to help me
                    out. It was all very hectic.</p>
                <p>Last Saturday I went down town and had my hair done at the Trocadero Hotel. The
                    staff were all Chinese and did very well. A shampoo and set was only 12 baht, a
                    manicure 11 baht, which at the present rate of 22 to the dollar you will see is
                    very cheap. The price to make a dress is about $5.00. Cotton dresses can be made
                    up from the colorful sarong materials and the exquisite Thai silk is beautiful
                    made into dressy dresses.</p>
                <p>After the 8:00 communion service, Sunday, Mrs. Barrington invited me to her home
                    for breakfast, where I met her husband who was a dear. They have a most
                    attractive house where they have been living for four years and have lived a lot
                    in the Orient. The table was set with the typical Thai bronze ware which gives
                    an exotic touch. Next Saturday afternoon she is going to take me to China town
                    and the thieves market. Sunday I have invited them to come to the Club for the
                    buffet supper and film.</p>
                <p>One of the girls at the embassy, Beulah Buck, kindly invited me to the Oriental
                    for luncheon and to introduce me to the housekeeper who is Polish, married to a
                    Thai, and knows a Thai woman who speaks French who may be able to do my
                    alterations and mending. It was lovely sitting there watching the boats go by on
                    the river, muddy though it was.</p>
                <p>I had Dr. Wells and his wife to tea at the Club Saturday. Earl Wilson, connected
                    with the Cultural Attach�'s office is painting some charming Christmas cards for
                    me. The French vice consul at the embassy invited me for dinner the other
                    evening to a little house he had just moved into, which was very nice. I loved
                    the opportunity of keeping up with my French.</p>
                <p>One Sunday after church, Mrs. Barrington and I had a cup of coffee on the
                    Oriental Hotel veranda. There was a boat just taking off for the summer palace
                    where she said the “King and I” was laid. I was longing to go, but promised
                    myself to get my Christmas cards off. And we wouldn't leave until nearly
                    midnight and it was four hours up the river with lunch and Siam dancing
                    aboard.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Mr. Clyde Clark who has just arrived to be in the economic section, and was
                    posted in Madrid knows the Duchess Delasara and my friend Gilly there. Such fun
                    talking to him about these people. I have just heard I have an opportunity to
                    fly to Saigon on Wednesday at 7:00am. I am so excited. The Civil Aeronautics
                    plane goes occasionally and can take passengers, but I never dreamt I would have
                    this chance so soon. It seems it will not be coming back for three weeks, but I
                    don't mind paying my way back for I am too old and may not again have this
                    chance. Must get visa and piastres which are cheaper to get here and then pack,
                    give away my ticket to the benefit performance the Bangkok St. Andrews Society
                    was giving under the royal patronage of Her Majesty, the Queen Grandmother,
                    President of the Thai Red Cross Society, of “Rob Roy”, the premier of the Walt
                    Disney film. The plane takes about four hours and I shall be staying at the
                    Majestic Hotel. I have requested Air France to obtain a reservation back to
                    Bangkok on the plane Sunday morning. We fly over Phnom Penh, but do not stop. I
                    heard Saigon is like a little Paris.</p>
                <p>There were three girls transferred from the Paris embassy there I knew. Mr.
                    Lloyd, my nice young vice consul is such a dear about letting me go on these
                    trips and encourages me to take all the opportunities I have, which I appreciate
                    so much.</p>
                <p>Later, October 4</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Since last week, quite a lot has happened. I didn't get to Saigon after all. The
                    headlines in the newspaper put me off. They read “French Troops Seal Saigon,” so
                    I had a talk with the pilot and decided I had better not go, especially as I was
                    the only passenger and had to get back alone, I might have been stranded. I was
                    disappointed, of course, but it gave me a chance to use the tickets to the
                    benefit performance and took Rosemary Smeltzer, Personnel Assistant at the
                    embassy who lives at the American Club. It proved a very thrilling evening for I
                    saw the King and Queen. We were seated upstairs and not far behind where their
                    blue satin chairs were placed. Everyone rose, of course, when they came in, as
                    the Thai national anthem was played. The Queen is perfectly precious. She is
                    tiny, chic, exquisite, dainty, gracious and very charming. She came in carrying
                    a bouquet of orchids and wore sort of a hyacinth blue dress with a little peplum
                    bordered with a light thread of gold and tiny buttons from the neck down to the
                    peplum. Her hair was fastened with a diamond pin in the back. A charming touch
                    of glamour for those who couldn't see her pretty face. The King looked quite
                    serious and everyone says he wears a mask all the time, no expression at all.
                    Both are quite young. They had several men and women in attendance. The balcony
                    was decorated with orchids and garlands of sweet smelling flowers. When they
                    left some of the attendants carried sort of a gold casket. When I inquired what
                    that might be, it seemed it contained cigarettes. Then another attendant carried
                    in four glasses of an orange drink in glasses with gold tops. It was all very
                    impressive. The audience was made up, of course, of a great many Britishers.
                    Some of the men were in kilts as the St. Andrews Society presented the film.
                    Then there were Thais and several officers from the embassy. I saw Colonel
                    Phelps and his pretty, newly arrived wife, Dinny. It was a real Thai gala and my
                    first evening out in Bangkok. I went up to thank Mr. Parsons the next morning
                    for being so kind to offer me the tickets for it all.</p>
                <p>Florence Barrington came by to take me to communion on Sunday and to their home
                    for breakfast. She was very disappointed to learn via the servants' grapevine
                    that their lovely house is to be taken over after the first of the year for the
                    Cambodian Minister, who now lives next door to them.</p>
                <p>As I have been asked to translate French at the embassy on several occasions to
                    speak to the Cambodian and Vietnam legations, I think it would be more sensible
                    to carry on with French lessons rather than learning the Thai language and may
                    join the Alliance Fran�aise which is near the Club. I may join the Siamese
                    Society too. They have interesting lectures and go on fascinating trips now and
                    then.</p>
                <p>A chap arrived from the Foreign Office in London to be posted at the British
                    embassy in Laos. When he went to the airport, no one knew where the plane was
                    and calmly said, “Oh, well, you can take it next Wednesday.” We are all laughing
                    over the casualness of these people.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The Wells asked me for dinner last Sunday and they had also asked the Rev. Folk
                    of my Episcopal church. But he and his wife had people coming from Singapore and
                    were unable to come. So they had another couple from their mission. After dinner
                    Dr. Wells showed me all around their hospital. They lived just next to it.</p>
                <p>The other day when I went to the ladies' room at the embassy, I had a frightening
                    experience. There coiled around the handle that rolls up the windows was a snake
                    staring at me. A girl ran for the Thai receptionist and when she came she
                    exclaimed, “Oh, it is poisonous, it is not the green kind,” and sent for someone
                    to kill it. I looked on horrified when the Thai used a native type rake and hit
                    it directly on the head. When it uncoiled it must have been five feet long,
                    though quite small in diameter. Fancy, someone might have sat on it. You can
                    imagine how I tip toe in their now, look well around fearing the mate might be
                    somewhere near.</p>
                <p>Herman Seiler, manager of the American Club, said now is the season that snakes
                    wash down from the rivers and crawl out of the klongs. Sue Parish told me her
                    maid broke all the breakfast dishes on the tray when she looked up and saw one
                    looking down on her from the rafters in the dining room as she was serving
                    breakfast. I have never been in a place where I have heard such weird nocturnal
                    sounds. And, even the daytime the caw, caw of the crows is eerie.</p>
                <p>I am getting used to the shabby buildings. In fact, Bangkok has a way of growing
                    on one if you could keep your eyes lifted from the squalid beneath you to the
                    exquisite beauty of the temples above you.</p>
                <p>October 5, 1954</p>
                <p>Next weekend, as Monday is a holiday, I am going with Dinny and Bill Phelps to
                    Hua Hin where I went in February, but this time we are renting the Borneo
                    cottage way up the beach. They have asked a couple of chaps from JUSMAAG so we
                    will drive down in a big station wagon and I plan to take all of my beach
                    equipment. Last Sunday we drove to Ban Saing which is the beach nearest here.
                    There are convenient little cabanas all along the beach where we had our lunch
                    and changed for swimming. I just managed to have a swim before it rained. The
                    only snag to the place is it can only be reached by car, but most people have
                    them here.</p>
                <p>I was kept busy meeting people at the airport last week. The Counselor at the
                    embassy in Korea, Carl Strom, asked me to meet his daughter, Caroline, who was a
                    nice young girl of about 20 who planned to join Lucy Briggs in London where she
                    will be for a while. So, I shall give her the address of my British artist
                    friend, Elizabeth Keith, who had presented me with her autographed book she had
                    written and illustrated with her wonderful woodblock prints of Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Then a brief telegram came saying, “Meet Mrs. Kennedy.” She was due on a Saturday
                    at 2:00pm, so I dashed away from my little sewing woman I always have on that
                    afternoon, in order to be at the airport. The telegram gave no indication which
                    Mrs. Kennedy she was. So, when she arrived I politely asked if she was the Mrs.
                    Kennedy whose husband got a fish hook caught in his eye. She smiled and said,
                    “We are the ones who had all of the nine children.” So, I realized then, that
                    she was Rose Kennedy, wife of Joseph P. Kennedy, who was our former Ambassador
                    to the United Kingdom during the war. She was accompanied by her niece, Mary Jo
                    Goggin. They had booked air-conditioned rooms at the Trocadero, but the PanAm
                    man in Hong Kong thought they would prefer the Oriental, so the rooms were
                    canceled. I took them to the Oriental. I had no more seen them up to their rooms
                    and was talking on the phone to Mrs. Anschutz, arranging the car for them to the
                    Sports Club, when I turned around and they were down again with long faces
                    saying the rooms were too hot (of course it was the hottest time of the year).
                    So, I quickly said, “We will go over to the Troc and see if we can retrieve your
                    original rooms. So we did, but no luck, all of the air-conditioned rooms were
                    taken. So then I suggested that we go around to the Princess Hotel. They said
                    they had to have separate rooms, but they didn't look too inviting. Then I
                    suddenly thought of the Rat Hotel (it really has another name but everybody
                    calls it the Rat). It was quite a distance from the town but near the temples.
                    Meantime, the embassy car wasn't working very well so they suggested taking a
                    taxi and away they went, with them their luggage from the Oriental. I heard from
                    Mr. Anschutz Monday they were back at the Oriental but moving to the Metropole,
                    a hotel no one usually goes to, but could only hope it was quiet and air cooled
                    and pleased them. I saw them again at Mrs. Peurifoy's and Mrs. Kennedy looked
                    very attractive and young in a white dress printed with field flowers and a hat
                    to match and wore magnificent jewels. Mrs. Peurifoy sent me home in an embassy
                    car with them and when I got out at the American Club, Mrs. Kennedy said she was
                    on a strict diet and wondered if the manager, Herman Seiler, would be kind
                    enough to prepare a chicken for her to take on the plane tomorrow. Of course, he
                    gladly acquiesced. She and the chicken flew away off the next day voicing deep
                    appreciation.</p>
                <p>Mr. Anschutz knowing I had given up my entire Saturday afternoon, kindly said I
                    could take some time off on Monday, so I did as I had to arrange the seating for
                    the American Association luncheon when the speaker was to be the German Charg�
                    d'Affaires. Then I went to Jim Thompson's to get the painting Earl Wilson did at
                    the American Club and had framed in a bamboo frame mounted with a white Thai
                    silk mat. When his French assistant, Mrs. Burrows saw me, she said, “You have a
                    present from Mrs. Kennedy.” Well, I nearly fell over. When I opened it I found
                    the most beautiful blue Thai silk stole. Mrs. Kennedy had asked Mrs. Burrows
                    what color I liked and Mrs. Burrows said she suggested blue to match my eyes. I
                    was really quite overcome by her generosity and wrote at once to thank her at
                    the Ritz in Paris where she was going next. Jim Thompson showed me the May 16
                    issue of Life with an interesting article with colored pictures of his Thai silk
                    business. He said Mrs. Kennedy ordered some silk exactly like that in the photo
                    for a dress to wear in Palm Beach.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>In the March 7 issue, there is an interesting article on Rangoon. Mrs. Peurifoy
                    said several months ago there appeared in Time an article about Miss Caulfield
                    and the blind school. I feel I must subscribe to these magazines. One gets
                    starved for such magazines out here.</p>
                <p>October 11, 1954</p>
                <p>Married in Japan just 24 years ago today. Had been wanting to go to the Nelson
                    Hayes library and get some books on this part of the world with Mary Singhouse,
                    the ambassador's secretary. Some people come in for a passport from Saigon and
                    they say it is quite quiet there now.</p>
                <p>American Club, October 16, 1954</p>
                <p>The days are glorious and I plan to go to the Bangkok Sports Club for a swim on
                    my noon hour now as two other girls do for we can ride over in the embassy car
                    and they call to take us back to the embassy. I take a sandwich and eat it after
                    my swim while basking in the sun.</p>
                <p>I have met the Norths, friends of Alice Spaulding Bowen from Honolulu. He is a
                    motion picture producer and she is very clever too in the business that puts
                    bubbles in Coke Cola. Both are extremely attractive and have asked me to come up
                    and watch them shooting scenes some evening at 9:00. It isn't far from here.</p>
                <p>We have been very busy in the embassy lately and I am getting a lot of experience
                    in the consular work for which I am most grateful. It is so pleasant to work for
                    someone who is so nice.</p>
                <p>American Club, October 21, 1954</p>
                <p>I called the Coutons, Thai friends, and my Persian friend Malek. Mr. Couton was
                    most cordial asking if he could come to the Club to see me that very afternoon
                    and bring his wife. They couldn't have been kinder and asked if there was
                    anything at all I wanted. I said I would like to find some silver paper for
                    lining chests to send to my sister. They invited me for dinner at a Chinese
                    place this Tuesday and then to their home. Mrs. Couton is going to Chiang Mai on
                    the fourth of November for ten days.</p>
                <p>Next Sunday I am taking the all day boat trip sponsored by the YWCA, up to the
                    King's summer palace where the “King and I” was filmed. We leave at 7:00am and
                    are supposed to get back at 7:00pm, but it depends on the tide, it may be
                    midnight.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The UN black tie party the other evening was quite interesting. Most of the
                    nations put on a skit of some kind. The French did a wonderful takeoff of the
                    “Frere Jacque,” well known nightclub life in Paris. The Chinese did sort of a
                    drama in their gorgeous costumes and high falsetto voices. I loved the Japanese
                    dances. Mr. Janning and his French wife, had taken Beulah Buck and me and wanted
                    to leave before it was over. So, Miss Cliamous wanted to see the Laos program
                    and Thai dancing.</p>
                <p>The Marines at the embassy are giving a big formal ball and the Ambassador's
                    residence the 10th of November. I got out my green taffeta formal and could
                    hardly zip it up the back, so shall swim at noon all week again and only have a
                    sandwich. I lost a few pounds in the week doing that.</p>
                <p>Florence Barrington took me to see the apartment building going up just across
                    the street from the church that was being put up by a prince, a member of the
                    royal family. I had spoken twice with him about it.</p>
                <p>I went to the library Saturday and got a book called “Land That Smiles,” about
                    Thailand and written by a Mr. Wood, a former British consul, now living in
                    Chiang Mai, where I hope to go over the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. We
                    have a consulate there and Rufus Smith is the consul.</p>
                <p>Everyone carries baskets here. We have bowls of lovely small orchids on our
                    dining table frequently and gardenia bushes grow along the klong. I love the
                    mornings when I get up and look out to see the gay plumaged birds flitting in
                    and out of the palm trees.</p>
                <p>American Club, October 24, 1954</p>
                <p>I finally sent my note of introduction Alice Pool gave me to her friend, Conrad
                    Parkman, who invited me to dinner with a dear Australian girl and a Vietnamese
                    chap, who had just received his visa to go to school in Illinois. He has a
                    brother at the Vietnam legation who I had met at the Club. It was a most amusing
                    evening. Conrad had two beautiful Siamese cats with the names of Cadillac and
                    Quiet. Someone suggested giving the name of Jeep to the offspring. He also had a
                    gibbons for a pet. In case you don't know, it is a small size chimpanzee. Many
                    people have them here but they rather give me the creeps. Conrad, a chap of
                    about 34, was a Fulbright teacher, but now in the police department and lived
                    here about four years near the King. In the film he showed of his trip around
                    the world were pictures of the King's mother who entertained in Lucerne. I
                    understand she is coming soon to visit the King. He mentioned having some lilies
                    planted their by him that were brought from Switzerland. Their house was
                    surrounded by a klong and at the time I thought how romantic it was to sit on
                    his veranda and looking at the lovely fuchsia colored water lilies that bloom at
                    night. But not so. The next day I found my legs and arms covered with mosquito
                    bits. It is the second time I dined in a house with no screens downstairs. You
                    spend the entire evening waving away the bugs and scratching.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>My friend, Florence Barrington, said, “Instead of spraying yourself with Chanel
                    #5, you should have anointed yourself with mosquito preventative.” How true!</p>
                <p>When I arrived, his first remark had been, “Don't you want to take off your
                    shoes?” I'm glad I didn't because my feet would have been covered too.</p>
                <p>American Club, November 14, 1954</p>
                <p>Have just come from having luncheon with my friends, the Barringtons and feel
                    very sad. They have been transferred to Manila. They are pleased because their
                    son, Jack, has just been transferred there from Japan, Branch of the National
                    City Bank, but I shall miss them terribly. Florence has been such a good friend
                    and I have not met anyone like her here.</p>
                <p>Also news came on Friday, while Mr. Lloyd was on holiday, that his home leave
                    orders had come. He is to start immediately on eligibility, January 23, and then
                    be sent to Oslo, Norway. I knew his wife would be anxious to hear the news so
                    after work I took the message to her and we had a long talk together. I have
                    liked them so much and shall be very sorry to see them leave. I understand his
                    replacement will be coming from Trieste, but don't know when.</p>
                <p>The rainy season is over now and the days are slightly cooler. Arthur (Inaudible)
                    and his wife, who were in Paris, arrived and brought my pearl clips from
                    Mikimoto in Japan.</p>
                <p>The Marine Ball given at the residence which is just across the road from the
                    American Club was delightful. When we walked up the drive it was like entering
                    an old plantation house in the deep South. It is quite large and open all
                    around.</p>
                <p>It was Josie, the wife of our first Ambassador to Siam, Edwin F. Stanton, in
                    1946, who discovered the residence. It was set far back off Wireless Road with
                    an avenue of magnificent dark spreading rain trees leading to it. A sprawling,
                    sagging house, painted chocolate brown, with shutters hanging precariously and
                    the whole house listed to one side. The extensive gardens surrounding the house
                    was crammed with rusty junk, remnants of jeeps, trucks, etc., gun carriers and
                    tanks, left there by Japanese troops. The property was encircled by a wide canal
                    containing more rusted junk that jutted out of the water at grotesque angles.
                    Nevertheless, the possibilities of the place kindled Josie's imagination. She
                    found it in shocking repair. The Japanese troops had burned spots on the
                    teakwood floors with their charcoal braziers. Plumbing had been wantonly smashed
                    and ripped out. Not one inch of electric wire remained. The fine tile floor of
                    the enormous patio was stained by motor oil drippings. The property belonged to
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She asked if the Foreign Office would undertake
                    the necessary repairs if the United States government were to rent the place.
                    Taken a back they agreed. An army of workmen was set to the task of cleaning and
                    renovating, a stupendous job that took months, complicated by the lack of
                    material.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>When I arrived, eight years later, 1954, I was enchanted with the place and it
                    was still a sprawling structure but with great charm and atmosphere. The same
                    magnificent shady trees still stood and led to the delightful house. Rooms
                    opened on to the now beautifully cultivated gardens to accommodate guests, where
                    a staggering number of government officials, prominent Thai, visiting VIPs and
                    celebrities were entertained sometimes at small tables where conversation was
                    always scintillating and the atmosphere was always warm and cordial.</p>
                <p>A most horrible thing happened last evening. Mr. Depin, in our embassy general
                    services, called me and said the packing company was getting his boxes out of
                    the Godown warehouse and had gotten mine out by mistake. But it was one of those
                    happy mistakes for they discovered white ants all over it, known in our country
                    as termites and I should come immediately and look at it. So Mr. Alexander came
                    for me and showed it to me by flashlight. I was horrified. He said it should be
                    opened without delay because he didn't know how far the termites may have
                    penetrated. So I was over there at 7:30 this morning having dreamed all night
                    about it. Well, they sprayed it first, then began the grand opening while I
                    waited breathlessly with ten coolies. Fortunately, the termites had not yet
                    gotten into my boxes but, when the paper that lined the van was pulled up the
                    termites were thick and they had already riddled the floor of the wooden van.
                    Luckily it was lined with that oily paper or they would have made a sorry mess
                    of my things. They had been working about a week. I was told this Godown was
                    located near the river in dark low ground and the floor is of wood that the
                    beasts love. So they started on my box which was of pine, which they also love.
                    It was a godsend that it was discovered now. It would not have been long before
                    I might have had a real tragedy. My linen and everything was strewn all over the
                    driveway. The excelsior and boxes in the enormous van were all burned and made
                    such a large flame that the police came for they had seen the smoke from the
                    lookout tower.</p>
                <p>The embassy had started classes in Thai every Monday and Thursday from 8-9:00. I
                    have joined, so now I can say a few words in Thai.</p>
                <p>American Embassy, November 30, 1954</p>
                <p>Just a note to let you know I am safely back from my Thanksgiving weekend in
                    Chiang Mai. I went up by train on Wednesday night which took 24 hours and flew
                    back by plane Sunday afternoon, which took 2 and a half hours, and had a
                    wonderful time. Mrs. Barrington sent her car and chauffeur to take me to the
                    train where the Colsons were waiting for me with a box lunch and a note of
                    introduction to the Prince of Chiang Mai. When I reached there, the First
                    Secretary of our embassy here, Sam Eaton, who was spending a week there, met me
                    at the station with Rufus Smith, the Consul of our Chiang Mai office. Shortly
                    after I was taken to a progressive Thanksgiving dinner party with about 40 other
                    Americans. The last place was the Harold Youngs. He is a famous animal expert
                    who traps rare specimens to send to the National Museum in Washington and showed
                    his zoo which is quite large and filled with bears, monkeys, lynx, etc.,
                    etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Then I browsed in the shops and saw the silk weaving, how they make silver bowls
                    out of Indian rupees and visited the temples. An American artist I had met in
                    Bangkok, Ara Lee Gaul, was staying at the same hotel and I was especially
                    delighted she was there since no one in the hotel spoke English, although it was
                    quite nice and modern and served the best food in Chiang Mai.</p>
                <p>The prince, who had shown me around, said his wife would have taken me to see the
                    elephants in the teak forests if I could stay over a day as they are very far in
                    the jungle, but I felt I should get back to the embassy. Although, when Mr.
                    Lloyd heard this he said I could have stayed on. He is always so
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>Chiang Mai was surrounded by mountains and was so refreshing, not the hectic
                    traffic as here and much cleaner. A quiet, charming place to spend a
                    holiday.</p>
                <p>It has been poignant with excitement here the last few days what with the arrival
                    of the new Ambassador, Peurifoy, and his deputy he had in Greece and Guatemala,
                    who he brought with him, Norbert Anschutz. The King's birthday yesterday and the
                    Cinerama show on Saturday and the opening of the Fair which takes place
                    tomorrow. Also the animal bizarre which was opened by the King's mother, who has
                    just arrived from Switzerland. The Queen was to have opened it but she is
                    pregnant, expecting in April. The King's sister accompanied the Queen Mother as
                    she opened the booths. They are both very attractive. I bought a few odds and
                    ends. It was very international. The wives from each embassy and legation had a
                    booth and sold articles from their own country. I saw a lot of people I knew and
                    chatted with the padre of the church. I was so glad to at last meet Mrs.
                    Yamamoto of the Japanese embassy, whom Mrs. Reisneider had asked me to look up
                    but had not yet done so. I fell into conversation with a charming Japanese woman
                    from whom I had bought a purse and finally said, “I wonder if you know Mrs.
                    Yamamoto?” And so it was a lovely surprise when she said presently, “I am Mrs.
                    Yamamoto.” She said Mrs. Reisneider had written her I was coming and wondered
                    why I had not gotten in touch, which made me feel a bit delinquent. She was
                    adorable.</p>
                <p>When I saw a very pretty woman standing with a little white hat on, which was
                    rare as no one wears even little hats here, I inquired who she was. Florence
                    Barrington said she was Mrs. Peurifoy and introduced me. Florence's son had
                    crossed on the Cleveland with her and the Ambassador as he was going to his next
                    assignment at the National City Bank in Manila and had a pleasant chat. Her
                    husband had been brought around to the various offices at the embassy the day
                    before. He is very good looking and seems like he has a strong character.
                    Florence also introduced me to the daughter of the Premier Priboon.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Saturday night one of the boys at the embassy had a cocktail party and we all
                    went on to the Cinerama show afterwards. It was a big invitational black tie
                    affair given by the Americans. All the dignitaries were there, including the
                    King and his cabinet and all the diplomats. Ambassador Peurifoy gave a wonderful
                    speech, his first. I had never seen Cinerama before. It was terrific. I went
                    with the Paralillies who have been transferred here from Paris and one or two
                    others.</p>
                <p>We went to Two Shay Eye afterwards. It was the nightclub here and was packed. I
                    got home at 3:00am and was up at 7:30am to go to communion. Florence had invited
                    me to lunch with some out of town friends.</p>
                <p>December, 1954</p>
                <p>I felt very honored the other day when the Personnel Officer came to me and said
                    that Ambassador Peurifoy was interested in having the VIPs given special
                    attention and wanted someone who could answer their letters. He was very anxious
                    that the congressmen received every courtesy upon arrival and while here—making
                    hotel and plane reservations, etc. So Mr. Clore, the Administrative Officer,
                    recommended me! As soon as the other girl replaces me in the consular section, I
                    am to go up to the Ambassador's office and assist him. I think it will be very
                    interesting and I am very pleased to be selected.</p>
                <p>December 9, 1954</p>
                <p>I wrote my sister I wished I could have access to her secretarial books and felt
                    I needed “Who's Who,” so I would know more about some of the important people
                    who were coming out here. The Personnel Officer, Mr. Janey, said Mr. Acheson,
                    the Secretary of State, was not very popular with Congress and they are trying
                    to rectify all that now. I would have to contact Marcelle L'Conte of our Paris
                    embassy for a little job description of how she handled her work, but believe
                    she is on route to the US now.</p>
                <p>We have a holiday Friday and thought I should like to go away but decided to stay
                    at home and get thoroughly settled in my room and all set for the new job. Mrs.
                    Peurifoy has invited all of the American ladies to call tomorrow afternoon from
                    4:30 -6:00. Then she will be having a regular at-home every Wednesday.</p>
                <p>We can telephone the US for $9.00. I would like to call you all around Christmas
                    if I can make the proper arrangements.</p>
                <p>December 13, 1954</p>
                <p>Christmas is creeping up all too fast. It is lovely, bright and warm here...</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Today I moved into my new office, one of the few air-conditioned and next to Mr.
                    Anschutz's, who is the Deputy Chief of Mission and who called me to his office
                    and handed me this telegram from the Ambassador at Phnom Penh, Cambodia, saying
                    that his wife, Mrs. McClintock, is arriving tomorrow and he wants me to met her
                    and assist her until her departure on Friday. Also, to make her return plane
                    reservations. This will be the sort of thing I will be doing now. The telephone
                    service is awful and I could not use the phone all morning, so I went down town
                    at noon, ate a sandwich in the car, and made a reservation at all three hotels,
                    the Oriental, Princess and Trocadero, just to be sure she would have one. It has
                    been difficult now due to the Fair that is on.</p>
                <p>Florence introduced me to the person in charge at the Oriental, so I will be sure
                    to get the right attention on these things. Mr. Anschutz outlined a little more
                    of my work. I am to find out first who Ambassador Peurifoy is to make official
                    calls on and who he can just leave cards on. He also asked me to arrange the
                    calls for Mr. Conover, the new man in charge of the economics section who
                    incidentally was at the Paris embassy when I was there. Then eventually I am to
                    write biographical reports. There will be various matters of protocol I shall
                    have to know about. It all sounds very interesting and I am very pleased with
                    the new assignment.</p>
                <p>I saw Mrs. Peurifoy today and told her how much I had enjoyed her party. She is
                    so beautiful and sweet. Everyone has fallen in love with her.</p>
                <p>I spent the long weekend getting settled in my room. I shall put white orchids in
                    my gilt bird cage. They are only 30 cents a spray. I made a Japanese flower
                    arrangement of three rose-colored anthuriums, the three only 75 cents. The
                    manager is going to paint my room after the first of the year. Then I am content
                    to stay here. It is so convenient to the embassy and just across the road from
                    the residence.</p>
                <p>You will probably hear from Mary Singhouse, the Ambassador's secretary who is now
                    on route on home leave and will be transferred to Teheran where she wanted to
                    go, I don't know why. She is bringing you a little gift, Mildred, and will tell
                    you all about my job as she trained me. I will miss her terribly. She is the
                    nicest girl I have ever known in the Foreign Service. The present secretary to
                    the Ambassador, June Acough, and the one to Mr. Anschutz, Georgia Marlow, are
                    newer than I, so we are all feeling our way.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>The Ambassador just gave a reception for 500 people and it was an opportunity for
                    me to meet quite a few. I met Elaine Trimble's neighbor, Mr. Kunjara, and his
                    daughter, Toi, who remembered them. I had a long chat with the Japanese
                    Ambassador and his wife. Others I met were Mr. and Mrs. Peekdip. He is in charge
                    of protocol here, and I shall have a lot of contact with him. Then the Norwegian
                    Minister and his wife, General and Mrs. Hull. He has taken MacArthur's place
                    here in the Pacific. He appeared with six of his officers wearing the new
                    bestowed Order of the White Elephant and very impressive. I also met the French
                    wife of the Minister of Finance and the Chinese wife of the French military air
                    attach�. When I said goodbye to the Ambassador, he introduced me to the Belgian
                    Minister standing beside him and chatted with the wife of the Swedish Minister I
                    had met. Also met several Americans in several organizations I had not known
                    before. There was a very good orchestra and the house and garden lent themselves
                    very nicely for the number of people who came.</p>
                <p>The Peurifoys are beginning to give a lot of dinners now and I am to arrange the
                    seating according to protocol which is quite a job, knowing where to put the
                    royal family and where to put in the diplomatic corps and all the others. It is
                    all very difficult, but interesting and so much to learn. I am enjoying it all
                    immensely.</p>
                <p>January 20, 1955</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred</p>
                <p>You will be interested to hear that I have just come from meeting Mrs. Theodore
                    Roosevelt, Jr. and her daughter, Grace, Mrs. William Macmillian, at the airport,
                    and taken both of them to the Oriental Hotel. I remember that you had written
                    that they were planning to come out here. Then a circular airgram was received
                    from the Department that they were coming, but gave no exact date, until a
                    telegram arrived this afternoon about 2:00pm from Bill Donovan to say they would
                    be here today! I immediately called the Oriental and PanAm and luckily the plane
                    had not yet arrived but due at 4:30pm. Ambassador and Mrs. Peurifoy were
                    relieved to hear that I would go to the airport for I had mentioned having met
                    her son at some of your cocktail parties and her daughter-in-law, Frances, who
                    married her son, Quinton, was an old friend. Mr. Martin Taylor from PanAm had
                    already arrived at the airport and was assisting with their luggage but
                    discovered they had left their passports on the aircraft, but he hastily
                    retrieved them.</p>
                <p>I inquired about Frances who was supposed to meet them here, but Mrs. Roosevelt
                    said that when she spoke over the telephone in Manila with Cornelius, learned
                    that Frances' mother, Mrs. Webb, was still in the hospital waiting to have an
                    operation, but hoped to come soon.</p>
                <p>I remembered how kind your long time friends, the Webbs, had been to me when I
                    was on route to Washington after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Princess Rangsit, invited me over to tea the other afternoon and then she and her
                    husband took me to see the apartment he is building. He had decided to put in a
                    frig and facilities for cooking since I spoke to him some time ago. I think I
                    would be warm on the third floor. Still feel I am better off at the American
                    Club where I am properly feed and safe and I love looking out upon the spacious
                    lawn at beautiful birds and palm trees.</p>
                <p>There are about six VIPs arriving on the Cumshome I have to look after, but will
                    be happy to look for your friends, the Conger Pratts.</p>
                <p>My new job has kept me terribly busy. The Personnel Officer said, “We will try to
                    get you a good grade.” At present I am an FSS-12 and I hope I can become an
                    FSS-11 for it would also mean I would have a better living allowance.</p>
                <p>January 20, 1955, American Club, Bangkok</p>
                <p>We [Roosevelts] had such a pleasant chat driving in from the airport. They said
                    Frances had planned to paint 40 paintings while here. Mrs. Macmillian knew Jim
                    Thompson, of Thai silk fame, who told me later he was so glad I had gone to the
                    airport to meet them for his car broke down at the last minute. He is having
                    them to dinner tonight with Mrs. Peurifoy. The Ambassador is in Chiang Mai.
                    There are also about four royal princesses that are entertaining them.</p>
                <p>I have engaged a car and guide for three hours tomorrow to take us to the marble
                    temple and emerald Buddha. Then luncheon with them at the Oriental Hotel. I have
                    still a photo that was snapped of Mrs. Roosevelt standing beside me as I
                    released a little bird from its cage which had a Thai religious symbolism. I may
                    suggest taking them over to the Sports Club afterwards if they aren't too
                    tired.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Peurifoy gave a small luncheon for them and invited me, but it was on the
                    Friday that I could not go, but appreciated her thinking of me.</p>
                <p>Several weeks after Mrs. Roosevelt had left, Frances did arrive, but
                    unfortunately in the midst of the SEATO conference when there were no hotel
                    rooms available. In fact, PanAm sent cables to al of their passengers not to
                    come for several days and warning them that there would be no rooms. Luckily, I
                    managed to get a room for her at the American Club. She could have gone to the
                    Oriental the next day, but liked the American Club so much she decided to stay
                    here for several days. Then went to Angkor Wat for a week. When she returns, she
                    will probably have to stay at the Park Hotel next to the American Club as there
                    is nothing available at the Club now. Then she hopes to go to Chiang Mai and do
                    some more painting.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I took her on the early morning floating market trip last Sunday with the Phelps.
                    It was, of course, most picturesque and Frances sketched the entire time. Then
                    we all went over to the Phelps for some cold beer.</p>
                <p>The night after she arrived, she was invited to the Ambassador's dinner he gave
                    for Senator Margaret Chase Smith. It was a big affair with so many celebrities
                    that I worked very hard over the seating arrangement. Princess Sawan invited her
                    for dinner Sunday and to see the Thai dancing. She is a dear girl and so like
                    her lovely mother, I always liked so much. She said she stopped off in Kansas
                    City to see her and she looked surprisingly well.</p>
                <p>Frances left me the most precious little pen set with brilliant stones when she
                    went off to Angkor Wat. On April 2, 1955, the day before Palm Sunday, I saw
                    Frances off on the plane at the crack of dawn. I asked Mr. Anschutz if I should
                    engage a car to take her to the airport at 4:30am and he said he didn't think it
                    was necessary as she was not a VIP or great American and had no claim on the
                    embassy, even though he had gone to school with her in Kansas City, Missouri.
                    But, somehow, I couldn't see myself lying in bed while she went off at that
                    early hour alone for I know how I appreciated it when my friends made an effort
                    to get up at such hours to see me off, and said as much to Mr. Anschutz. Then he
                    said, “Of course, if you want to, it would be very nice.” So, I did. And there
                    were a lot of little things I found I could help her with at the last minute.
                    She really is a dear girl and I have not for a long time been so impressed with
                    such a personality. She is truly worthy of the great name she bears. She did
                    quite a few sketches I liked but didn't finish them. She plans to put in the sky
                    and foliage when she got home to Oyster Bay, New York. She was very popular
                    while here and was up at dawn to paint and out nearly every evening. She left
                    presents for everyone. She wanted to leave me her book, Cultural Southeast Asia,
                    a marvelous book with wonderful illustrations on the subject. Costs about $6
                    here, but as she had made so many marginal notes I knew she would really like to
                    keep it and I would feel guilty accepting it. She tried to get it here for me,
                    but was told it would not be here for months. I really did want it very much,
                    but relinquished it with deep appreciation for her very kind thought.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Frances and my sister Mildred had been friends for many years and my heart ached
                    for her ever since I heard of the terrible tragedy that befell her. She was in
                    England during the war working with the Red Cross Club Mobile when she met
                    Quinton and they were married in Bradford, England, April 12, 1944. Quinton had
                    graduated cum laude from Harvard. During the war he took part in the North
                    Africa and Normandy invasions, was severely wounded and decorated three times
                    for gallantry. Soon after he was sent to China. After the war he worked in New
                    York in the office of China National Aviation Corps an affiliate of PanAm, then
                    was sent to Shanghai as its American manager with his wife Frances and their
                    three little girls. Late in December 1948, he flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong.
                    The pilot of the plane apparently blinded by sudden fog over Hong Kong crashed
                    and burned on Basalt Island. None of the 35 passengers and crew survived.
                    Frances and her three little girls came back to the United States and lived at
                    Old Orchard, Oyster Bay, Long Island, with their mother-in-law, Mrs. Theodore
                    Roosevelt, Jr. who wrote in her autobiography, (this book was given me by Mrs.
                    Peurifoy) “Day before yesterday was an incalculable blessing to me,” because she
                    came to live with her.</p>
                <p>Frances, every Christmas sends me a sketch she does of her growing family which
                    touches me deeply.</p>
                <p>March 7, 1955</p>
                <p>My trip to Hua Hin was just what I wanted and had, a real rest on a most heavenly
                    beach and in a very nice hotel. I took the train on Friday so was a day ahead of
                    the crowd, and walked along the divine beach with sandwich so I could stay out
                    all day. I was about the only one on the beach, but the next day it was very
                    crowded. The Ambassador and Mrs. Peurifoy came with little Danny, their nine
                    year old son, and the Norwegian Minister and his wife and several people from
                    our embassy. Mac Hall, second secretary in the political section, drove down
                    with one of the Thais in the Ministry who showed me all around Hua Hin. I
                    decided to return on the train Monday, although the Ambassador said the German
                    Charg� would drive me back and Mac Hall also offered to drive me the next day.
                    But I feared already I had had too much sun. When the Ambassador returned he
                    said I should have stayed over and seemed a little piqued that I didn't. We had
                    had a pleasant chat on the beach where he was heavily guarded and which seemed
                    to annoy him.</p>
                <p>The next night was a reception at the Lewis Davises. He was the manager of the
                    Bank of America and had known Charlie when in London. He had a large house and
                    lovely garden where there were many guests I enjoyed meeting, including Prince
                    Sawan and several other Thais. I chatted with the Charg� from India, Mr. Setti,
                    who was very attractive, and several others from his country. And Prince
                    Rangsit, with whose wife I had had tea. I had gone with the Spinks who invited
                    me for dinner after the reception. He is a great scholar of Japanese and had a
                    fabulous library of books on Japan, many of which were in the Japanese language
                    which he reads fluently. They lived for several years in Japan and their
                    charming home is filled with many Japanese things they collected while there. I
                    love looking at his Japanese prints.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>The other evening the chief of USIS (United States Information Service), Dr.
                    Meagor, and his wife, gave a lovely reception in their garden which was all
                    decorated with Japanese lanterns and artistic flower arrangements. I went with
                    Sam Eaton, Secretary of the embassy and his attractive wife from Chile who spoke
                    with a charming accent. After the reception, I invited them to come back to the
                    American Club with me for dinner. The other night they invited me for dinner
                    with the Conovers. He was in our embassy in Paris and now counselor of the
                    economic section here. Also, the Attach� of the German legation, a German
                    doctor.</p>
                <p>Not long ago, Mac Hall, a most attractive chap in our embassy, whose sweet mother
                    is here with him, thought I might like to look at the house of a departing
                    American belonging to Princess Priboon. So we were invited to tea. But I thought
                    the house was too big, however, I did enjoy having tea with them and meeting
                    Princess Priboon, who was an authority on Buddhism. The departing American was
                    Virginia Hightower, being transferred to Chile to be head of the language center
                    there.</p>
                <p>I went home with the Halls for pot luck dinner with them. I was sorry to hear
                    that Mac was being transferred to Naples and I will miss them. Mrs. Hall lent me
                    a fascinating book on Thailand entitled “Mango Season,” by Grung Hall. The
                    characters in it are disguised by name but actually certain people who used to
                    be in our embassy. Mac and I are going to the Siam Society for dinner this
                    Thursday and I have asked him and the Spinks to come by for a drink before.</p>
                <p>The day the Cumshome arrived was Washington's birthday, but no holiday for me. I
                    had about four couples to look up plus the Conger Pratts and Pearsons, who were
                    not on my list. Mac Hall asked if he could come with me to be of any help and I
                    was most grateful. But when the Ambassador heard they were aboard, he asked me
                    to write them a little note for his signature to say he was sorry he couldn't
                    entertain them but he was having to go to the airport to meet Mr. Robinson, the
                    Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>The Conger Pratts invited me to have luncheon with them, but I was obliged to
                    decline because I had several people to look after, but asked them to have
                    cocktails with Mac Hall and me at the Oriental before they rejoined the
                    Cumshome.</p>
                <p>I would have liked to have seen the ship, but they had to come up the river in a
                    tender that took about three hours. The newspaper said, “It was a millionaire's
                    cruise.” Mrs. Pratt said one passenger had her own masseuse aboard with her. I
                    enjoyed them all so much.</p>
                <p>Last week I was asked to come down to the consular section while the girl had to
                    relieve the secretary of the administrative section, who was on leave. So, I
                    have been carrying on wearing two hats and getting as many inquiries on protocol
                    here as I am on consular work.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>I must be up at 5 tomorrow morning to go to the airport to meet the Ambassador
                    from Canberra and Mrs. Peaslee, and then at 11:00 to the Oriental to help
                    arrange the seating for the American Association luncheon, which is given every
                    other Tuesday with some important man being the speaker. Tomorrow it will be the
                    Austrian Minister.</p>
                <p>Shortly after received a beautiful pen from Martin Taylor, manager of PanAm with
                    note. I received a nice note from my sister's sister-in-law introduction to
                    General Cunjara who lived next to them in Washington, D.C., and planned going to
                    the States soon. And also a note from Mrs. Hubbard and one from Florence
                    Davidson saying she had given Helen Keller, a very old friend, a note to me. But
                    I don't think she is coming to Bangkok from what I read in Time magazine.</p>
                <p>It was such a shock to hear Mrs. Peurifoy's father died on February 14. I
                    immediately wrote her a note of sympathy and she sent such a sweet thank you. It
                    read</p>
                <p>“Dear Mrs. Biddle, Yours was the first note to reach me after the sad news of my
                    father's sudden death and your kindness and thoughtfulness helped me so much.
                    Thank you for your sympathy. Losing a parent is never easy for me, for we are
                    never prepared to part from those we love. Sincerely yours, Betty Jane
                    Peurifoy”</p>
                <p>She is so gracious, everyone loves her.</p>
                <p>I go to help her at home every Wednesday and find it helps me in meeting various
                    people. I met the sister of Ernest Hemingway who said to me, “I met someone in
                    Singapore or Manila, who wanted to be remembered to you, but I couldn't remember
                    who it was or where.”</p>
                <p>March 28, 1955</p>
                <p>Lucy Briggs, the daughter of the Ambassador to Korea, now assigned to Peru, came
                    through a few days ago. I met her at the plane and bought a white skirt from her
                    for $7.</p>
                <p>I plan to go on a holiday to Pinang soon where I hope to find some cottons. I
                    decided to have the Phelps and P.D. Howard, an Englishman, for dinner on the
                    night of my birthday. Will get a couple of bottles of champagne from the
                    Commissary. They are about $3 each. And I will have Herman Seiler, manager of
                    the Club, bake me delicious birthday cakes.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The other day I went to the airport to meet Mrs. McClintock, wife of the
                    Ambassador in Phnom Penh, whom I have met before, and a Mrs. Allen and Lucy
                    Briggs. While we were riding into town discovered Mrs. Allen was in Saigon when
                    her husband was Charlie's boss. I asked them to have cocktails at 6:00 with me
                    at the Oriental and we chatted some more. They flew back to Cambodia the next
                    day. Lucy Briggs is on her way around the world. Mrs. Allen was most delightful
                    and invited me to visit her in Phnom Penh and said, “My husband would like to
                    meet you.” It strikes me very strange that I should keep meeting so many of
                    Charlie's friends, as if that phase of my life is reopening periodically.</p>
                <p>Saturday I went with the Eatons to the Naval Attach�'s reception for Rear Admiral
                    Davis, who arrived on the airplane carrier Essex. I wore my black dress and put
                    up my hair, it is getting so long now and is much cooler. I stuck a little
                    brilliant pin in the back and felt very gay. At the reception I received an
                    unexpected invitation from Lt. Miller, one of the Rear Admiral's aides, to go to
                    dinner at the Prime Minister's guest house where the Admiral and four aides were
                    staying. So, off we went. The guest house is beautiful. It is where Senator
                    Margaret Chase Smith stayed and some of the SEATO and many dignitaries. Others
                    to dinner besides the Rear Admiral were his two aides, the Captain, and Bill
                    McGonigal, our tall and handsome Naval Attach�, his aide and wife, the daughter
                    of JUSMAAG Army Captain Picton and a Thai woman in a most striking dress of Thai
                    silk. They wear some beautiful dresses.</p>
                <p>The dinner was delicious as was the champagne served afterwards. I had a
                    wonderful time. When I got home I was amazed to find it was a quarter to four in
                    the morning!</p>
                <p>The Ambassador is having luncheon on the Essex today and going out by
                    helicopter.</p>
                <p>Palm Sunday, American Club, Bangkok, Thailand, April 3, 1955</p>
                <p>It is getting really hot now and necessary to shower often. I am delighted to
                    hear that the Department has established my position at the embassy. I now have
                    my own air-conditioned office to myself with a little plaque beside the door
                    “Protocol - Mrs. Biddle.” I am enjoying the work so much now that I am getting
                    into the swing of it. It makes me feel very proud to have reached this stage in
                    my career. I am hoping to have some holidays in May, as we have several long
                    weekends. I am awfully anxious to go to that nearby but little heard of country
                    called Laos. Planes do go but it is difficult to find a place to stay. Some go
                    and stay in tents, it is that primitive. But the old capital, Mrs. McClintock
                    tells me, is something out of a fairy tale with temples along the river and very
                    primitive transportation. We have a consulate there and another girl from here
                    and I will go together. I also hope to get to Pinang, I hear it is a little
                    paradise.</p>
                <p>April 11, 1955</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>How I wish you could be here so I could give you a big hug for being so sweet and
                    remembered me so beautifully on my birthday. Wish you could have been here to
                    help me celebrate the 5th. At noon, went as usual to help with the sitting
                    arrangement at the American Association luncheon when they all sang “Happy
                    Birthday” to me. In the evening I had invited Bill and Dinny Phelps and my
                    English friend, P.D. Howard, for dinner but didn't tell them it was my birthday,
                    until the champagne was poured and the cake all decorated with white and pink
                    roses were brought in. Herman Seiler, the manager, has an excellent pastry cook,
                    and he out did himself. When one of the guests discovered it was my birthday
                    played “Happy Birthday” softly on the piano and I cut some cake and sent it into
                    them.</p>
                <p>The next day was a holiday and Bill and Dinny asked me to go with them to see the
                    room that is open only once a year that contains statues of the five kings of
                    the Chakri dynasty. The present king is King Rama IX. Then took some colored
                    photos around the palace grounds and stopped at the Rat Hotel for a cool drink
                    before going on to their house for luncheon. It is so hot now. I find myself
                    lying on the chaise rather limp.</p>
                <p>Sunday we had a mango shower. It cooled things off considerably. It is the season
                    for them and they are delicious.</p>
                <p>The Prime Minister Priboon and a number of his staff, including Cunjara are
                    leaving for the States and Europe on the 14th. Martin Taylor is going part way
                    to see that all goes well. So gave a dinner for the American Association at
                    government house and I was very pleased to be invited. It was a black tie affair
                    and about 125 there. I went with Mrs. Conover. Her husband had not gotten back
                    from Japan in time for it and Mr. and Mrs. Clore went with us. He is the admin
                    officer. The Ambassador and Mrs. Peurifoy and the Anschutzes had gone to the
                    beach for the weekend. It was a wonderful party. The government house is
                    tremendous of Byzantine architecture and looks like one of the chateaux on the
                    Loire, and particularly so on Saturday when it was all illuminated. The Prime
                    Minister does not actually live there, but all of his official entertainment
                    takes place there.</p>
                <p>He greeted us graciously as we entered the magnificent marble hall and were
                    ushered into the reception rooms where cocktails were served. I chatted with the
                    other guests while little rivulets were pouring down my back, front legs and
                    arms. It was so hot, especially after I had a Scotch and soda. I realized then
                    my green taffeta was not to be worn in a hot country!</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Shortly after dinner was announced and as Conrad Parkman happened to be standing
                    beside me, offered me his arm to dinner. It was delicious. Sherry with the soup,
                    sauterne with the turbot, red wine with the pigeon and then curry and champagne
                    with the ice cream. An orchestra made up of old Thai instruments and some modern
                    Western instruments played the entire time, while men and women sang. Young men
                    in sailor suits served us and it was very impressive to see them come in in
                    single file. Of course, there was a speech by the Prime Minister and Martin
                    Taylor and a toast to the King while the Thai national anthem was played and a
                    toast to the President while our national anthem was played.</p>
                <p>There were tiny little corsages of orchids and other flowers for the ladies.
                    After dinner coffee was served on the terrace where colored lights played on the
                    fountain. Then we returned to a grand room where we saw a beautiful performance
                    of Thai dancing in their exquisite costumes. Mrs. Davis, wife of the manager of
                    the Bank of America, sat next to me and said the Bank of America is meeting the
                    Prime Minister in San Francisco and showing them all around that part. Then they
                    go to see the Grand Canyon. Then to Niagara Falls and will be guests at Blair
                    House in Washington. It is the first trip for the Prime Minister in thirty
                    years. His wife appeared in a beautiful purple Thai silk dress with silver
                    threads in it and wore a gorgeous diamond necklace. Their daughter married to a
                    doctor, Roc, also will be on the trip. I got home about midnight and felt it had
                    been a very interesting experience.</p>
                <p>(Inaudible) had written me a birthday letter and was amazed it had reached me on
                    the very day from Paris. I don't feel at all like 51 and only hope I can keep as
                    well and as young as I feel now.</p>
                <p>April 25, 1955, American Embassy</p>
                <p>I am off to Pinang at 7:00am on the 5th and will be gone until the 9th, flying
                    Thai Airways. We have a holiday the 5th and 6th, so I am taking every advantage
                    of this long weekend. I will have a few days, but only one will count against my
                    leave. I will reach Pinang about noon and will spend that night at the Ian Knoll
                    Hotel. I will look around the shops and do a little sightseeing, then go to the
                    Lone Pine Hotel. I hear it is lovely on the water where I will spent Friday,
                    Saturday and Sunday and plan to return to Bangkok early Monday afternoon. The
                    plane also on route, both ways, stops at small places called Phuket and Songkhla
                    in southern Thailand. I hear Songkhla is a lovely spot for swimming, but no
                    hotel there. I am very much looking forward to this little holiday.</p>
                <p>Yesterday there was a lot of trouble in Saigon and no one is traveling there. I
                    wonder if I will ever get there. You will have my letter by now acknowledging
                    your nice birthday check. I may buy one of the little heads here that are
                    collection items.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>So many of our people will now have duty in Washington. The consul in Chiang Mai
                    is to have the Thailand desk in the Department that Kenneth Landen had. His wife
                    wrote “Anna and the King of Siam.” Dinny is expecting her baby in August, so
                    afterwards she won't be able to do very much. We are planning some little
                    excursions.</p>
                <p>Yesterday we drove to Peta Buri, about three and a half hours from here on the
                    road to Hua Hin where there are some famous caves where “Sainte Vinya” was
                    filmed. A blue colored film written by Robert North, who died just a week before
                    it had its grand gala for charity. It was so tragic. He had only been ill a
                    week. He and his wife were friends of Mrs. Alice Spaulding Bowen in Honolulu,
                    she had asked me to look up. It was a rather steep climb up to the caves, but
                    lovely with the frangipani trees in full bloom. Inside the caves were different
                    sized Buddhas. This is where Frances Roosevelt came to paint a couple of times.
                    We had our picnic lunch beside the ocean sitting on the sand under a tall palm
                    with a heavenly breeze blowing while we watched the native fishermen bring in
                    their nets of fish. We were the only ferrangi, as they call us around here.</p>
                <p>There is a new hotel just built near here, but not a tree around it and it looks
                    so uninviting. It is set in a pichi buri which is lovely. The hills are graced
                    with old temples and the King's palace was gleaming white in the sun. We had
                    stopped at Nakorn Pathom on route to see the biggest chedi in Thailand, which
                    was very interesting. It had been a delightful outing. We plan to go to Hua Hin
                    in the end of May and rent the cottage that belongs to the Borneo company. They
                    have a good cook and it won't be expensive.</p>
                <p>This Saturday, Christ Church is having its 50th year jubilee and the Bishop will
                    be here when there will be a big reception at the parsonage. Bill Phelps said
                    the King may come. The Church was given by the previous Kings Mongkut and
                    Chulalongkorn made famous by the plague.</p>
                <p>I saw the film “The Last Time I Saw Paris,” Saturday with the Eatons. The music
                    was so beautiful. I want very much to see the next film, “Beau Brummel” for it
                    is laid, I am sure, near where I visited last Easter, Bath, England where so
                    much of their Edwardian era was depicted in books and plays.</p>
                <p>There was a dance given at the residence last Thursday evening for the Personnel
                    staff of the embassy, including the Thai employs. Mrs. Peurifoy looked exquisite
                    in a long gown made after the fashion of those in “Gone With The Wind,” draped
                    with a pink rose in the back of a full skirt. As the residence looks like an old
                    Southern plantation house with lanterns everywhere and an orchestra playing in a
                    marquee on the lawn, it was a perfect setting for her. The Ambassador came and
                    sat at my table and talked for quite a long time. He is most attractive.</p>

                <p>This is just a line or two before I take off at the crack of dawn tomorrow for
                    Pinang. I must be up at 4:00am when an embassy car will take me to the airport.
                    The plane takes off at 7:00. I had gone with the Phelps to the 10:00am service
                    because of the big jubilee, 50th anniversary of the church. Bill ushered and the
                    church was packed. The Bishop was here from Singapore and the padre's wife, Mrs.
                    Folk, invited us for coffee after the service. Besides the Bishop and his wife
                    and a young British couple, the Normans, the Australian Minister who was the
                    speaker at the American Association on Tuesday, and the Rev. Rayburn and his
                    wife. The Folks are leaving in June and I shall miss them. The new minister will
                    be the Rev. Gilman. The day before at 5:00pm was the tea at the parsonage when
                    the Bishop spoke and others. A letter was read from His Majesty the King.</p>
                <p>...for luncheon. Then we went to the national museum and looked at all kinds of
                    interesting things until it closed at 4:00 when there was a terrific downpour,
                    but finally made it to the car and drove to the thieves market and browsed a
                    bit, but bought nothing. Then, looked at some paintings done by Earl Wilson of
                    our embassy. I bought for $2.50 one he had done of the American Club. Quite
                    charming. I shall have Jim Thompson frame it with a white Thai silk mat in a
                    bamboo frame. Then to the Phelps for hot chocolate and to see the “Egyptian.” A
                    bit disappointing.</p>
                <p>Bill McGonigal, our tall good looking Naval Attach�, gave a big cocktail party at
                    his place prettily situated on a klong where I enjoyed a long chat with Prince
                    Ram, the Foreign Minister, who said he would be leaving soon to attend his
                    daughter's graduation from Wellesley. He said she wanted to be an ambassador.
                    His wife seemed pleased over this, but she is getting wary of traveling with him
                    so his daughter could act as his hostess, I believe was the idea. He was elated
                    over his success with Japan in getting the amount of money Japan owed Thailand.
                    I followed with such interested Prime Minister Phibun's visit to America and so
                    when Ambassador Peurifoy had attended the decoration ceremony at the White
                    House.</p>
                <p>I started Thai lessons again, now after work, from 4:30 to 5:30, Tuesdays and
                    Thursdays and really find use for what I am learning.</p>
                <p>I went to a delightful cocktail party, the retiring Navy Captain in JUSMAAG gave
                    with his daughter the other evening. Then on to the Phelps for dinner they gave
                    for several of their men returning to the States.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>I have enjoyed meeting the James Van Allens who are here from their place in
                    Newport, Rhode Island, and who I have had under my wing and in turn so kind to
                    me. Mrs. Van Allen was first married to Frank (Inaudible), whom I remember had a
                    house near my school, Briar Cliff, and used to come over to the school
                    frequently for he was on the board of directors. They invited me to the Oriental
                    the other evening for dinner in the Bamboo Bar. Had the most delicious wine.
                    They were commissioned to do an article on Angkor Wat for National Geographic
                    and now would like an audience with the King which I had been trying to arrange.
                    They were off tomorrow at 8:30am for Hong Kong, so we planned to have a cup of
                    coffee together at the airport before we go our respective ways. I was leaving
                    on a holiday in Pinang. They will come back if they are lucky enough to have the
                    audience.</p>
                <p>May 10, 1955</p>
                <p>This is to let you know I am safely back in Bangkok from my holiday in Pinang.
                    For years I have been haunted by the uncertain remembrance of that little island
                    I simply could not recall if I stopped there on my way around the world in 1939
                    or not. Now the satisfaction of knowing means more than I could possibly tell
                    you. I do recall very definitely sitting on the terrace of the hotel and looking
                    out to sea. Remembered it reminded me so much of the hotel in Honolulu. Well,
                    now I know that was the Runnymead Hotel. It has since been taken over by the
                    military for officers' quarters. That is the reason no one speaks of it as a
                    hotel anymore.</p>
                <p>Believe I have mentioned the plane stops at Phuket and Songkhla in south
                    Thailand. Well, there was nothing but three little mat huts at Phuket at the
                    so-called airport, but the scenery between Phuket and Songkhla was breath
                    taking. Beautiful little islands covered with trees dotted the sea. Songkhla was
                    a much larger place and had a half hour wait. The only thing I could see to read
                    in English in the little building where we waited was the schedule that amused
                    me. “Daily, except Sunday, Wednesday, Tuesday and Friday.” Everything else was
                    in Thai.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Pinang about 1:15pm and I took a taxi into town where I stayed at
                    the Ian Knoll Hotel, the best hotel there. Situated directly on the water. The
                    food was delicious. I had a lovely big room with a small balcony and for this
                    and breakfast I paid $5. I changed my money before leaving Bangkok and got 3
                    Malayan dollars for 1 American dollar. After freshening up a little I went out
                    to see what I could find in the way of cotton dresses at the English department
                    store that is all over the east.</p>
                <p>I thought I would drop into the consulate and ask a few questions. The nicest
                    little Chinese girl, Betty Yee, was so helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I tried on several things at the department store, but those English dresses did
                    not fit me until I saw the most divine evening dress that had just been
                    unpacked, not even marked yet. When I put it on it just fit me, and absolutely a
                    dream. It was white knit, with a full skirt and wide band of black lace around
                    the bottom, bodice made of black pleaded net and black lace. I just fell in love
                    with it and felt I had to have it, especially as I really did need it. So I
                    bought it for $245—don't faint, that is Malay dollars, although it really looks
                    like a 245 American dollars dress and I am sure it would be that in the states,.
                    it actually came to $81 American. It merely needed trimming off a little at the
                    bottom—five layers, one cotton, one silk, two net and the outside layer.</p>
                <p>Then I ran across the street and bought that book on culture in Southeast Asia
                    that Frances Roosevelt wanted to give me. Took a little samlar, though they are
                    called something else in Pinang, back to the hotel. That night I had a delicious
                    dinner and sat on the terrace in the moonlight and listened to the jet planes
                    darting back and forth in the sky, and watched the ships at sea.</p>
                <p>The next day after a wonderful English breakfast I liked so much, I ordered it
                    twice—the best meals the English serve are their breakfasts and teas. It was so
                    nice to hear the nice quiet refined voices of so many English people around
                    me.</p>
                <p>After the enormous breakfasts I took a drive around the island previously
                    arranged with a smiling Malayan who had brought me in from the airport for $7.50
                    American, almost 40 miles. I asked to go up Pinang Hill, via funicular cable car
                    like in Hong Kong. It was 2300 feet in the air and it did feel so bracing and
                    there was a marvelous view of the island and mainland beyond. Stayed up there
                    about half hour and then continued on around the island stopping at the snake
                    temple which fascinated me though I hate snakes. It is curious how the Chinese
                    worship them. They were everywhere, coiled above and beneath everything, doped
                    by the incense they burn. They are vipers. I was invited to touch one, which I
                    declined, of course. They say at night they all come down on the floor and crawl
                    around.</p>
                <p>We passed a number of military barracks, charming Malayan villagers, and like
                    every other place in the world where Chinese are, the most enterprising, many
                    Chinese villages and small rubber plantations. The hills were covered with lush
                    tropical foliage. A winding drive finally led us along the sea coast and then
                    arrived at my hotel, the Lone Pine. I had heard many people speak of it. It was
                    very simply operated with Chinese. The food, not as good as Ian Knoll, but
                    beautifully situated directly on the water. The palm trees were growing right
                    down to the water's edge. Everyone had a little veranda off his room and could
                    step out onto the terrace in his bathing suit and in a few minutes jump into the
                    heavenly surf for a swim. We lunched and dined under the pine and palm and as it
                    was a full moon weekend, it was most romantic. It is only at times like this
                    that I am sorry that I am alone.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>The next day I spent most of the time in my bathing suit and had several swims
                    and basked in the sun in comfortable chaise lounges. Most of the people were an
                    odd assortment of English with the wrong accents. I didn't speak to anyone the
                    whole time I was there, but was quite content. Wrote one letter to Nicole in
                    Paris so she could have the stamps for her collection.</p>
                <p>Saturday morning, Betty Yee came out and drove me in her little Morris car to
                    waterfall gardens and I knew the moment we started driving through there I had
                    been there before. I remembered the monkeys running across the road. It was
                    lovely and quiet and cool and, like the whole island, refreshingly, green and
                    clean. Then she took me to a Chinese shop she knew where there were the smartest
                    dresses. I found three that fitted and fell in love with.</p>
                <p>May 13th, American embassy</p>
                <p>Dear Aunt Edith,</p>
                <p>I know how interested you will be to hear of my meeting Helen Keller and her
                    companion, Polly Thompson, whom you have admired so much. I thought of you the
                    entire time and wished you could have been here to have experienced the thrill I
                    had and felt it should have been yours. It all happened very suddenly. I was
                    just ready to sit down to lunch on Wednesday when I had a telephone call from
                    Mrs. Anschutz saying, “Did you know Helen Keller was arriving at 12:30pm?” I
                    said, “No,” breathlessly swallowing my last bit of lunch. Although Florence
                    Davidson had written me some time ago she had given her a note of introduction
                    to me, I had read in the paper she was not coming to Bangkok. Well, it happened
                    that the Indonesian legation had been notified of her arrival and telephoned
                    Mrs. Peurifoy, but she was going out and could not be at the residence when they
                    arrived to offer them hospitality. So, I went over, it was just across the road
                    from the American Club. At about 2:15 the third secretary of the Indonesian
                    legation arrived with their luggage and said they would be at the residence in
                    about five minutes. It seems they had been guests of the Indonesian government
                    in Indonesia and had to come this way in order to get a plane to Rangoon the
                    next day. He had also contacted a Miss Caulfield who is head of the blind school
                    here, who shortly arrived with them.</p>
                <p>Meantime, Mrs. Peurifoy had returned to the residence but had several things to
                    do so asked me to receive them. They stepped from the car a few minutes later
                    and, of course, I was delighted to greet them. Helen Keller had a face of an
                    angel and does not look at all her 75 years. Polly Thompson is Scottish with all
                    the charm of the Scottish people. It was terribly hot and they were awfully
                    tired. They declined a dinner invitation at the Indonesian legation and said
                    preferred just a tray in their room. They were put up at the little guest house
                    because Mrs. Peurifoy already had Mrs. Yost and her two children staying with
                    her. Mr. Yost is our ambassador in Laos. I had some cold water for them to
                    drink. But they said they would like to have some Scotch and whiskey, which was
                    a little unexpected, but Miss Thompson told me later that the doctor ordered
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>While the boy was fixing the sheets on the bed, I lost no time in asking about
                    the film, “The Unconquered,” that you have been so anxious to know about. They
                    said they did not know where it was playing just now. It was privately financed
                    but cast in Cornell and Mrs. Levy and others in New York did not want it to be a
                    Hollywood spectacle because it is a true story. Polly Thompson said she thinks
                    it is to be shown in schools and places like that as a documentary and will live
                    forever.</p>
                <p>That afternoon was Mrs. Peurifoy's at home day so I returned at 4:30pm, but they
                    did not appear. They just wanted a quiet rest and didn't want to see anyone. The
                    moment I approached Mrs. Peurifoy I detected on her the most heavenly fragrance
                    and mentioned it. She said, “Well, I thought as Miss Keller couldn't see me, she
                    would be able to smell this fragrance.” I thought, how dear of her. As Mrs.
                    Peurifoy had to make a call the next morning she suggested I take them out to
                    the airport in the private car of the Ambassador's with their six pieces of
                    luggage. So I was at the residence about 9:30am. An Indonesian Minister came a
                    few moments later to pay his respects and we had a cool drink. Then going out to
                    the car I said to him, “Will you be going to the airport, Your Highness?” And he
                    replied, “No, I have to go and give some blood.” When I said, “How patriotic,”
                    he explained that he had been for a long time head of the Indonesian Red Cross
                    here. And then I added, “So you must set the example.”</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>When we got into the cars, just sitting up in front with the driver, Polly
                    Thompson wanted me to sit in the back seat with them so that we could talk
                    together about Florence Davidson. En route to the airport we stopped at the
                    blind school for Ms. Caulfield and a Thai woman who is well known here for her
                    work with the blind. It was interesting to see how Polly Thompson made Helen
                    Keller understand what we were talking about. She holds her hand and spells out
                    the words on it and at the same time speaks aloud repeating the first syllables
                    and some of the words. Helen Keller smiles sweetly and raises her hand
                    frequently as if she had experienced some inner glow about something. When I was
                    sitting along with her in the car, I lowered the window and she said very
                    plainly, “Thanks.” Although it is difficult to understand most of her other
                    words, when she met Mrs. Peurifoy she pronounced the name with a French accent.
                    I hear she speaks French fluently. She mentioned that she smelled the fruit as
                    she drove out to the airport. Polly Thompson said her sense of smell and touch
                    are, of course, highly developed. She thought it was a long drive, as, of
                    course, it is, and was so hot. It seems they are making this trip under the
                    sponsorship of the Foundation for the Blind, but they had not put Bangkok on the
                    itinerary. They felt there was not enough for them to do in Pakistan so they
                    accepted the invitation of the Indonesian government and decided to go there
                    instead. They said they have no time to write but Polly Thompson wanted postals
                    of the water buffalo and klongs. Helen Keller asked if the cattle were sacred.
                    Polly Thompson, said, “No, we are in a Buddhist country.” They will be coming
                    this way again next Thursday on their way to Hong Kong and Manila and I hope to
                    see them at the airport for a couple of hours. Polly Thompson said they were
                    very spoiled having been guests at the homes of presidents and governors, and
                    governments all along the way. I began to get a little nervous at the airport
                    because the third secretary did not turn up with their passports and tickets
                    until about 20 minutes before they were to take off. I naturally felt very
                    responsible for them and drew a sigh of relief when he finally appeared. An
                    American came by to ask if she could be introduced to Helen Keller. She was a
                    newspaper woman but did not want an interview, so I introduced her. I was glad
                    they were driven out to the plane as it was a bit of a walk and so hot. Polly T.
                    kissed me goodbye and said to kiss Helen Keller. So I did. I told her what an
                    admirer you were, Aunt Edith, and she said to send you her love. I longed to
                    have you by my side for I knew what a pleasure it would have been for you, dear
                    Aunt Edith. I am sorry I could not obtain anymore information about the film,
                    but perhaps schools in Pasadena, particularly the blind school, would know about
                    it. Do hope you are keeping well and you and Dad are taking good care of each
                    other. So much love, V.</p>
                <p>American Club, Sunday, May 22, 1955</p>
                <p>Dear Dad and Mildred,</p>
                <p>This is the one day in all the year that our hearts go out to one another in
                    deepest sympathy because of the loss of our precious mother, thirty-one years
                    ago today. The 19th, too, I felt we were thinking of each other. And dear Harold
                    we loss three years ago. May is indeed full of sad memories for me. But I am so
                    grateful we still have each other although we are so far apart. But we always
                    have the thrill of seeing one another again.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Dear Aunt Edith,</p>
                <p>Now I have more to tell you about Helen Keller. I believe I mentioned that she
                    would return through Bangkok on her way to Manila. Well, she did, at 4:30 in the
                    morning. The embassy had a telegram from the consulate in Rangoon to notify Mrs.
                    Peurifoy and Miss Caulfield and so I did. I thought it wonderful of Mrs.
                    Peurifoy to get up at that early hour, but she had bought some Thai silk for
                    them, and for one reason I suppose she wanted to be sure they liked it. She
                    called for me in the embassy car at 4:00am and then we picked up Miss Caulfield.
                    It was raining. I took along an extra umbrella just in case they didn't have
                    one. Also, the morning paper and my letters from Mrs. Joe Davidson, Florence,
                    that I thought would interest them and some postal cards of the water buffalo
                    and klongs they mentioned wanting. We were there to greet them just as they
                    stepped off the plane and had such an interesting visit for about an hour and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>They said the temples in Rangoon were magnificent, the gold leaf on them
                    marvelous. So, now I must see Rangoon. Miss Thompson read a letter from
                    Catherine Cornell regarding the preparations for Helen Keller's 75th birthday on
                    the 27th of June and her request to give to the blind and not to her on that
                    day. Miss Thompson had more news about the film, Aunt Edith. It seems the State
                    Department is going to take it over, so they will know where it is going to be
                    filmed. Helen Keller's new book, “The Unconquered,” will be out in October and
                    she had me give her my card with address and wrote “book” on the corner. So,
                    perhaps I shall receive an autographed copy, which would be wonderful.</p>
                <p>The rubber band on Helen Keller's hat had gotten loosened at one end and Polly
                    was holding it helplessly in one hand, so I thought I would come to the rescue
                    and said, “I have a pin, I will fix it.” Whereupon Mrs. Peurifoy nicely said,
                    “Oh, Mrs. Biddle always has everything.” We chatted together so pleasantly and
                    when we went to the ladies room I led Helen Keller over to the sink to wash her
                    hands. Polly said that the East Asiatic correspondents were reluctant to ask any
                    questions and she had to conduct the interviews simply because they revered old
                    age and infirmity so much they do not like to speak or touch such people. I
                    could well understand it, for I felt the same way. She is really a saint and
                    would not be too surprised someday to hear that she was canonized. Just to look
                    at her is an inspiration. I will never forget her beautiful blue sightless eyes.
                    We stayed until they left and then came home.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Peurifoy is such a dear and I enjoyed being with her so much on this rather
                    long trip back and forth at such an early hour to the airport. She said when we
                    parted, “Now you must take some time off during the day.” It was so
                    characteristically kind of her. But, I didn't because I was much too busy. We
                    both felt it had been a heartwarming experience. As Mrs. Peurifoy said she felt
                    she may never see her again and I was reminded that Florence Davidson wrote that
                    they had said they were going on their last trip around the world. It was
                    announced after, over the radio, that the President of the Philippines honored
                    Helen Keller with an award.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>1955 American Embassy, June 28</p>
                <p>Today I had to arrange the seating of 60 of the diplomatic corps and important
                    Thai for the Prime Minister's welcome home luncheon the American Association
                    gave. He told us of his trip. There were about 500 there and the biggest thing
                    of the year. Mr. Jim Scott gave the important ladies an orchid and I was quite
                    touched when he presented me with one. Now, I have also been trying to get out
                    215 invitations for the Fourth of July reception the Ambassador is giving on
                    that day. Then I was put on the food committee for the Fourth of July picnic
                    which the American Association is giving that day from 11-4. There are a lot of
                    details connected with all of this. I have to get all of the food, that is, hot
                    dogs, beans, and buns for about 800 to 1000 people.</p>
                <p>Then there had been Senator Dirksen and an ambassador visiting for whom the
                    Ambassador and Mrs. Peurifoy have been giving a series of dinners. And, of
                    course, sending the invitations and arranging the seating of them takes time.
                    Then I have to go to the airport to meet some of these people which takes a lot
                    of time from my duties.</p>
                <p>The two inspectors are here now. I have started dance lessons every Monday,
                    Friday from 5-6 but not always able to go. It is the Thai dance which is so
                    pretty and graceful.</p>
                <p>It is raining a lot and sometimes not able to get to the coiffeur and get my hair
                    done so go on my noon hour and eat a sandwich either in the taxi or under the
                    dryer.</p>
                <p>The Symphony of the Air was here and, of course, thrilling. The Ambassador and
                    Mrs. Peurifoy had a summer party for the cast after one of the concerts and
                    kindly invited me. The president, Mr. Gillus, who I had gone into supper with,
                    invited me backstage the second night when the “Rhapsody in Blue” was played. I
                    invited the Phelps, the Landreths, a darling couple from the Naval Attach�'s
                    office, Commander Bill McGonigal, the first night.</p>
                <p>I hear Perle Mesta is coming in July and also (Inaudible) Roosevelt, Cornelius's
                    brother.</p>
                <p>Mildred, your plans for coming out sound wonderful. I should love to see the Taj
                    by moonlight which will be December 28, so let's try to count on that and work
                    out the other plans accordingly. Dad, I shall be thinking of you on July 9 and
                    have happy memories of our reunion last year.</p>
                <p>July 9, 1955</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>I am writing this at the Bangkok airport to say that I am taking off in about one
                    hour on Admiral's Stump's personal plane for Saigon. There are eight others from
                    the embassy having the same free trip. I am so excited to at last be seeing that
                    little Paris of the East. I hope to get a USOM plane back early Monday morning.
                    If not, I will take the next available commercial flight. USOM would not cost me
                    anything. It is the government agency Charlie was in.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, Penny Robinson is secretary to the Naval Attach� there and knew
                    him. She was here visiting last week. I hope she will have made reservations for
                    me there for two nights. All of this came up because of Lt. Colonel Bill
                    Letterer, who is aide-de-camp to the Admiral, was on the Coolidge with me in
                    1939 and we had many pleasant chats together about writing. His “All the Ships
                    at Sea” became a best seller. The American Association picnic was so glad the
                    Fourth was over. I was chairman of the hotdog stand and after counting all of my
                    chits we took in $175. Then I had to look after the 2000 guests who came to the
                    reception that evening when the Star Spangled Banner was played. It was a
                    beautiful party at the residence.</p>
                <p>Looking forward to our Christmas holiday together in India.</p>
                <p>General Powell had paid for decorating the entire place. The gardens are
                    tremendous and little pavilions were put up here and there to keep the guests
                    out of the rain. We never knew when it would pour. All of the members of the
                    diplomatic corps were invited, plus 215 Thai dignitaries, plus all of the
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>The Fifth was a Thai holiday, so went to the Sports Club to relax and swim with
                    Penny Robinson.</p>
                <p>After the Ambassador's party, Commander McGonigal, Bill, asked me to go to dinner
                    with him and Penny. So we went to the Bamboo Bar at the Oriental and danced and
                    danced. She was very attractive.</p>
                <p>American Embassy, July 15, 1955</p>
                <p>As you know Professor Smiley and his party were here to view the eclipse and
                    invited me to the palace at Ban Pang where they were to set up their camp. The
                    Queen and King's sister were there, but I did not receive the message sent by
                    one of the newspaper reporters that I had met them all at Mrs. Peurifoy's at
                    home. It was fascinating. It got quite dark and then a burst of light leaving a
                    beautiful rosy glow over everything just like that rosy glow in the south of
                    France at Province where Renoir and the Impressionists loved to paint. Shortly
                    after, he lectured at the Siam Society. I spoke to him again. The King's mother
                    and sister sat directly in front of me and many in the diplomatic corps were
                    there and Prince and Princess Rangsit, with whom I had had tea, and Prince and
                    Princess Prim, whom I had also met. The princess is very charming.</p>
                <p>July 15, 1955</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>This is to let you know that I arrived back safely from my trip on Admiral
                    Stump's plane to Saigon, but not without very exciting experiences. The plane
                    was beautifully appointed and you could hear no sound of the engines. We arrived
                    at 4:00pm. The Naval Attach� met me and said Penny was waiting for me at the
                    Majestic where she had made reservations for me and that there would be
                    transportation into town for me and my friends. There were a lot of other
                    uniformed men at the airport. The Majestic was very comfortable. The best hotel
                    in town, as a matter of fact. I found it a little cooler in Saigon than in
                    Bangkok. Alice Lukso, the only other girl who stayed over, was put up by a
                    friend she had there. The girls in the embassy had the most attractive living
                    quarters and nicely furnished. Some are air-conditioned. But they should have
                    some compensation for the confused political state they live in, but they all
                    seemed to take it in their stride. Fortunately, the shops stayed open quite late
                    so we were able to shop for the cologne I wanted.</p>
                <p>There were numerous shops all giving different prices. It truly was like a little
                    Paris with its sidewalk cafes and the French language signs. Although all the
                    street signs are now in Vietnamese with French underneath in small letters. It
                    had the stimulating atmosphere of Paris and it was fun to hear and speak again
                    the language I love so. I had got an excellent rate for my dollar in Bangkok
                    which was double what I could get in Saigon so I took back two large bottles of
                    Coty's Le Monde and two of a label just slightly cheaper than Paris. Then I got
                    a large bottle of champagne like I brought back from Paris for Dad's birthday
                    for two dollars and a small bottle that serves about two for 37 cents.</p>
                <p>That evening Penny and I dined together. It was good to have delicious French
                    food again with champagne and watch the dancing. Who should I see but Anita
                    Lauve, the girl I was first assigned to when I went to Paris, who was cultural
                    affairs officer then and now political officer in Saigon. In fact, there were
                    several girls that I had known in the embassy in Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>The next day, Sunday, we shopped again and it was wonderful to have the shops
                    open on Sunday, too. I bought some hairpins which, believe it or not, I could
                    never find in Bangkok. After lunch we went over to the embassy and Penny showed
                    me some photos that had been taken at a benefit party at Charlie's she had
                    attended. Photos of Yeti and her daughter. Yeti looked glamorous in a very tight
                    Chinese dress slit up the side. I thought Charlie looked quite grey. I thought,
                    “What a small world.” Then we went back to the Majestic and met some of her
                    friends sitting on the terrace of the hotel and joined them for a drink. We had
                    not been there long when we noticed a lot of pamphlets being dropped in front.
                    Some students across the street read them and marched across to us and began to
                    rally around, the leader holding the red and yellow Vietnam flag. I had to ask a
                    lot of questions to find out what was going on and finally found out. They were
                    demanding the communists who were staying in the hotel, a delegation of 16 who
                    had come for the elections which are taking place soon. The police arrived
                    shortly after with their Tommy guns to keep order. There was still a lot of
                    milling around and confusion. Just as if a firecracker had been lighted, the
                    shooting started. At this point Penny and I ran into the hotel. The gates to
                    both entrances to the hotel were closed and people began running down the
                    street. When I finally emerged from the Men's room where we had fled, not
                    knowing just where we were going, there were hats and sandals and shoes lying in
                    the middle of the street and I saw those boys piled in the paddy wagon being
                    taken to the police station. Then they came back for their bicycles and piled
                    them in the back end of the truck. So often when things get tragic they get
                    comical. They were all falling out of the back end and they had to come back
                    again and again for them. Then we saw the police searching one of the men, I
                    suppose for a hand grenade. Then someone saw a body with blood streaming from it
                    being thrown in the car and carried away. Then we heard other demonstrations
                    going on in other sections of town. When we finally thought it was safe to get
                    into the cars to drive over to where Alice Lukso was staying, who was trying to
                    see about getting us on the USOM plane, her phone wasn't working. We found a
                    note not giving us much hope. I had already booked on the Air Vietnam plane that
                    morning, just to be on the safe side and lucky I did for it was the last
                    seat.</p>
                <p>Then we went on to the apartment of four boyfriends of Penny's called Open Arms
                    and on the little boy's room it said “guys” so we just knew it would say “dolls”
                    on the little girl's and it did. We were not there long when one of the boys
                    came in to tell us the anti-Americans had put a time bomb on the steps of USIS,
                    our information bureau, but the security officer had found it before it went
                    off. I learned that there are so many factions that the people there are
                    confused about the situation. They are becoming terribly anti-American and there
                    are different factions fighting among themselves. The people who lived there
                    said they had not had such a demonstration for some time or been so near one. I
                    was really interested to see a little excitement and would have felt cheated if
                    I had come to Saigon without seeing something like this.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>The next day I shopped some more and found some adorable clothes. I fell in love
                    with the most precious black lace dress. It had been $79 but the French woman
                    let me have it for $42. By this time I had run out of money, but just as in
                    Pinang she allowed me to take it anyway and send her the piastres.</p>
                <p>The French are all leaving by the boat loads and selling their businesses, etc. I
                    went up to one of the apartments above the USIS building where several of the
                    girls lived, for a drink with one of the girls I had known in Paris. Just next
                    door was another girl I had known in Paris so we had a wonderful chat. Their
                    apartments were most attractive, like little penthouses in New York. They showed
                    me a big hole in the sidewalk where a hand grenade was thrown not long ago. Now
                    I know what goes on in Saigon.</p>
                <p>I was up at four the next morning to take my plane to Bangkok. It was a small
                    plane and certainly not comparable to the admiral's, but it was the first return
                    passage I could get. Alice Lukso was still there when I left, but came back
                    Thursday on the USOM plane. We landed in Phnom Penh, Cambodia somewhere in a
                    field which I thought rather strange. When I asked some one they said the brakes
                    were broken. We were not far from the little wooden airport station so sat down
                    there to wait the takeoff which was supposed to be in a half hour. But it was
                    three hours before we finally left.</p>
                <p>Meantime I wanted so much to call Mrs. Paul Allen, who had invited me to come to
                    Phnom Penh some time, but thought we would be leaving any minute. However, I
                    finally decided to ring the embassy and spoke with her husband, who I had never
                    met. I hardly had time to say hello before I had to say goodbye because I saw my
                    fellow passengers going out to board the plane. I could hear him say, “Can't you
                    stay over? If Mrs. Allen had known she would have been at the airport.” But it
                    was all too late then. It only cost $20 to return on the plane.</p>
                <p>Someday I should like to go to the little resort in the hills they say is so cool
                    and lovely called Da Lat, but I am wondering how much longer Saigon will be an
                    open city. Laos is now the hot spot. Poor Thailand, so quiet and calm and happy
                    and peaceful, but absolutely surrounded by turbulent countries.</p>
                <p>The inspectors have been here and I had an interview with a Mr. Morris. He knew I
                    was very interested in continuing the work I am now doing, but thought the
                    number of posts requiring a person for this type of work were very few. So, he
                    proposed that I spend two years in the Protocol Office in Washington and getting
                    a good background and then could be sent out to one of the bigger embassies
                    fully equipped for a better job of this type and asked if that was what I would
                    like. I said, “Yes. I am very fond of what I am doing and am very happy
                    here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>I went to the French embassy on the occasion of their 14th of July celebration,
                    each embassy gives a reception on their national holiday, and it was something
                    out of a fairy tale. The embassy is an old one situated on the river near the
                    Oriental Hotel. In fact, it used to be call Embassy Row, but now only remains
                    the French and Portuguese. It was so impressive. A long line of French sailors,
                    so picturesque in their little sailor hats with red pompoms on them, stood at
                    attention at either side of the long driveway. I said, “Ma F�licitation” to the
                    French Ambassador and several members of the staff I knew greeted me. One couple
                    said they were so sorry they could not come to the American Association's
                    luncheon on Tuesday and I replied that I was not there myself, I was in Saigon.
                    The Pakistani Charg� introduced me to his wife as the manager of the embassy. We
                    stood beside each other as the national anthems were played and we toasted the
                    President of France and the King of Thailand.</p>
                <p>What was so unusually impressive was the ship, just anchored across from the
                    embassy all decked with flags. Launches went over periodically for people to go
                    over the ship where white wine and more hors d'oeuvres and caviar were
                    served.</p>
                <p>When I happened to see standing beside the Danish Minister and said, “Oh, I
                    believe this must be Danish caviar.” And he said, “I am afraid it is,” thinking
                    he was belittling his native country's delicacy. I quickly added, “But I love
                    Danish caviar.”</p>
                <p>I knew if I waited for the time to write you all, this will be delayed due to the
                    rate my life goes these days, so I am writing to you now at this late hour, even
                    before I remove my pretty black lace I bought in Saigon, to say I have just
                    returned from a dinner party at the Ambassador's in honor of Mrs. Perle Mesta.
                    There were 22 at a table. The guest list included the British Ambassador,
                    recently knighted as he is now Sir Barclay Gage, his wife, Lady Gage; the French
                    Ambassador, his wife stays in Paris; the Netherlands Minister and his wife; the
                    Spanish Minister, Senor Bendez, a good looking bachelor; the Portuguese Charg�,
                    the suavest man in the diplomatic corps; the Pakistani Charg�; and John
                    Marquand, the famous author and his son John, Jr., who was a writer and visiting
                    here. Mrs. Mesta asked all about you Mildred and hoped to see you in Washington.
                    She gave a graphic description of her experiences in Saigon. I had had a preview
                    of it all.</p>
                <p>To Mildred. July 28, 1955 at the office, 5:00pm</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I was just going down the stairs of the embassy last Thursday to meet Mrs. Mesta
                    at the airport when the Marine Guard handed me a telegram saying she would not
                    arrive until the next day. So I went to the snack bar to get a sandwich and
                    there was a man there just up from Saigon who said that the Majestic Hotel,
                    where I had stayed, was completely demolished and Perle Mesta had been staying
                    in it. Of course, I was horrified and understood so well what she must have
                    experienced having so recently seen what was happening there. That evening there
                    were headlines in the paper and an article about Mrs. Mesta having arrived in
                    Singapore with teargas stains on her dress. I at once thought of my friend Penny
                    and was relieved when Bill McGonigal handed me a letter from her saying she was
                    all right. But all her pretty clothes I had so recently admired in her closet
                    had been thrown out of the window. She was not in the hotel at the time. Some
                    American girls found them and they all had to be sent to the cleaners. The hotel
                    has been evacuated and they are all living with friends. She said it was a good
                    thing I was not there. They would have played havoc with all my cologne,
                    champagne to say nothing of my pretty new clothes I had just bought there.</p>
                <p>Telegrams kept coming in to the embassy, each one announcing the arrival, the
                    cancellation of Mrs. Mesta, but she finally arrived on Sunday at 11:00am. The
                    Ambassador had already planned to give a dinner party for her Monday evening and
                    I had already made out the guess list and arranged the seating for 22 people.
                    She had two ladies traveling with her but we didn't know in what capacity. But
                    Mrs. Peurifoy ascertained they were her assistants, one a secretary and the
                    other sort of a maid, and did not accept social invitations. When Mrs. Mesta
                    arrived, the Ambassador brought her over to me and said, “You know Mrs. Biddle,
                    don't you?” He apparently had heard from Mrs. Peurifoy that Mrs. Truman had
                    given a note of introduction to her when you invited me in Paris and was invited
                    to visit her in Luxembourg. I was a trifle embarrassed for a second for thought
                    she would not have remembered me and I would feel so foolish. But, no, and she
                    greeted me most enthusiastically. “Why, of course, I remember you. How is your
                    sister?” Then I mentioned your delightful visit with her in Luxembourg.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Dinner was delicious. Sauterne with the stuffed lobster, red wine with the lamb
                    and champagne with the peppermint ice cream encased in chocolate. As I am low
                    man on the totem pole here, I am usually placed below the salt at their dinners.
                    So, at the very end of the table from Mrs. Mesta who, of course, was at the
                    right of the Ambassador. When she caught my eye she graciously raised her
                    champagne glass to me and, of course, I was very touched and smiled and raised
                    mine in silent toast to her. After dinner I sat chatting with one or two. Mrs.
                    Peurifoy came over and said, “Wouldn't you like to go over and chat with Mr.
                    Marquand. He seemed quite happy with Lady Gage by his side, but I knew I should
                    obey the request. I very much enjoyed our conversation. Then, Mrs. Mesta called
                    me over and I joined the little group around her. She was interested in talking
                    to the Pakistani Charg� because she is going to his country. She is giving up
                    Indonesia because she said the Commies were after her and thought it wise not to
                    go there. She gave a graphic description of her exciting experience in Saigon.
                    While in Bangkok she was a guest of the Thai government and stayed at the
                    government guest house. The next day after the dinner she telephoned me and we
                    had a long talk over the phone. She asked me if you were in the State Department
                    and I said no, that you had married Jim Trimble, son of the Honorable South
                    Trimble who for forty years was Clerk of the House at the Capitol in Washington
                    and after your husband died was given a job decorating the veteran hospitals all
                    over the country. Whereupon she replied, “Bless her heart.” Then she asked me to
                    have you call her because she wanted to tell you that she had seen me. Then
                    mentioned that the wife of the Foreign Minister, had given her a silver compact
                    and wanted to know how to address a thank you note to her. She asked all about
                    my work here and wanted to buy some emeralds here. Frances Roosevelt had bought
                    some here recently. If she was going to India she would find some there. She
                    spoke of having some Thai silk from Jim Thompson's shop. I thought it so nice of
                    her to phone me and couldn't have been more friendly calling me, “darling” a
                    couple of times.</p>
                <p>Mr. Jenkins from our embassy and I called for her and her assistants at the guest
                    house today. Met her secretary, Mrs. Prichard, and the Scottish maid, Mrs.
                    Anderson. Mrs. Mesta and I rode in one car, the two assistants and Mr. Jenkins
                    in the other and all the luggage in the station wagon. Monty Taylor, manager of
                    PanAm, who was at the airport, told me she had pay $163 excess at each place. On
                    the way to the airport she gave me a few commissions to do: a telegram to send
                    to Washington, a note to give to Mrs. Peurifoy, and two autographed photographs
                    to give to the two Peurifoy boys, Danny the little one and Clinton, a spastic in
                    a wheelchair with only two years to live. They opened the VIP room for us at the
                    airport where there were several men from protocol and manager of SAS. She was
                    flying to Karachi. I happened to know one of the men. She told me in the car she
                    mentioned to the ambassador that we were very good friends of the Trumans and he
                    said, “What?” And he said.....</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>...I was so pleased to hear her say the Peurifoys were very fond of me. She plans
                    to stay at the Plaza Athena in Paris, but when she heard I had stayed at the
                    Vouillamont for four years she went into raptures saying she loved it and would
                    go there if she couldn't get in at the Plaza. She is to meet Elsa Maxwell in
                    Athens and will go with her on a cruise through the Mediterranean. There will be
                    a hundred people aboard and a ball is being given by the queen. She was anxious
                    to see the clippings of the press conference she gave last evening to about 40
                    pressmen. When I asked just where she was living now, she said in a Louis XIV
                    house which she wanted you, Mildred, to see. I spoke of her charming collection
                    of mice and birds I remembered so well seeing in her house in Luxembourg. It
                    really was fun being with her. She was so friendly. When she left she kissed me
                    on the cheek and blew a kiss to me from her seat in the plane. The Thais had
                    sent orchids for all three.</p>
                <p>August 11, 1955</p>
                <p>This is a hurried note to catch the mail to say I just had an opportunity to fly
                    to Manila on the Air Attach�'s plane, leaving here next Thursday, the 18th,
                    returning the 26th. I couldn't resist the free ride over and back. And the
                    thought of seeing again my dear friend, Florence Barrington was thrilling. Then,
                    too, I had been wanting to get to the PX over there. I have never been to Baguio
                    and as I have been wanting a holiday in a high cool place, I have written
                    Florence I would like to spend Saturday, Sunday and Monday up there. We fly over
                    North Vietnam and are due to arrive at Clark Field about 5:00pm. It is about 60
                    miles from Manila. It is a good time for me to go for the Ambassador and Mrs.
                    Peurifoy leave this afternoon for Hua Hin to be gone until the 21st so there
                    will be a little less work for me to do, although heaven knows I always have
                    plenty whether they are here or not. Tomorrow, being the Queen's birthday is a
                    holiday, but I may just work a little at the embassy. Fortunately I have a lot
                    of leave so can go away freely. I must take 16 days before the end of the year
                    or lose it, which I am sure will leave me enough for our trip to India at
                    Christmas.</p>
                <p>What tragic news this letter will bring. This is at the embassy, August 14,
                    1955</p>
                <p>Dear Dad and Mildred.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Not news, of course, because I am sure by now you both have read in your papers
                    of the horrible accident our Ambassador had on Friday the 12th. I have been so
                    stunned by the shock. It has been difficult for me to type this letter and to
                    put into words what is weighing so heavily on my heart, but I know how anxious
                    you must be to hear. I had written you that I had been invited to fly to Manila
                    in the Air Attach�'s plane, so I thought I should come to the embassy to get
                    caught up a bit, even though it was a holiday. I had been working all morning.
                    At about 2:00pm I went into the pouch room to post a letter to Mrs. Barrington
                    in Manila. The young girl, Miss Cazille, in there said, “Have you heard the
                    news?” I hadn't and she said, “The Ambassador has been killed and little Danny.”
                    I said, “I don't believe it.” She said that it must be true because they sent a
                    cable to the Department. I was so shaken I simply fell on a diplomatic pouch.
                    When I had slightly recovered I went down stairs and all of the political
                    officers, pressmen and others were looking very concerned. The telephone
                    operators were not on duty as it was a holiday, so the little Thai telephone
                    operator was sent for. They needed someone to translate. Mrs. Spinks and I sat
                    together absolutely shocked. We wanted to do something but, of course, at a time
                    like that we didn't know just what to do. Her husband, who is with USIS, advised
                    her not to ask any questions and sit quietly, so I did the same.</p>
                <p>The first news we had was that the Ambassador was driving a jeep. That kept
                    puzzling me and it was not until some time later that we learned he was driving
                    the Thunderbird, he had actually given to Mrs. Peurifoy but she never drove
                    it.</p>
                <p>The complete details were not clear at first, but we did know that the Ambassador
                    and Danny, who was in the front seat with his father, had been killed and
                    Clinton, the other child who was a spastic, and not expected to live for more
                    than two years, was in the back seat and was badly injured. It was fortunate
                    that there was a plane with a radio to bring Mrs. Peurifoy and the ladies back
                    as there isn't usually plane service there in Hua Hin. So, further news reached
                    us more quickly.</p>
                <p>It seems the Ambassador was driving with his wet Japanese clogs on and couldn't
                    manipulate the brakes fast enough to avoid a truck loaded with heavy lumber
                    coming head on over a narrow bridge. I finally said to Mr. Anschutz, who also
                    looked ruined, “Shouldn't someone go over to the residence?” So, after a while
                    the wife of our Army Attach� was sent over. The Naval Attach� had gone to get
                    Mrs. Anschutz to take her to the airport to meet Mrs. Peurifoy who stayed at the
                    hospital at the airport for a while and then was brought to the Seven Day
                    Adventist Hospital where Clinton is still with both legs and an arm broken. Mrs.
                    Peurifoy is spending most of her time there and only comes to the residence to
                    shower and change and have something to eat and then returns to spend the night
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I had not had any lunch but simply couldn't eat. I waited at the embassy until
                    4:00 in the afternoon and it was decided that Mrs. Spinks and I would go over to
                    the residence at 6:00pm. We were told that Mrs. Peurifoy would be coming shortly
                    but did not want to see anyone. She came in with the Prime Minister and Lady
                    La-iad, who had called at the hospital and insisted upon bringing her home.
                    After she had changed, she came down for a bowl of soup and I was simply amazed
                    at her fortitude. She was dried eyed and never a trace of the horrid tragedy you
                    knew she must be suffering. She did say, “I must hurry back to the hospital.”
                    When she came in I kissed her on the cheek but could not utter a word. I knew
                    she understood. We left her with Mrs. Cowen.</p>
                <p>I have been busy making rosters for ladies to go to the residence and read to
                    Clinton as Mrs. Anschutz said she wants to spend next week packing and wants to
                    leave Bangkok as soon as Clinton is able.</p>
                <p>I went down stairs to select samples of cards to acknowledge all the many, many
                    telegrams, notes and cards that have poured in from all over the world from the
                    President down, but none to be found. Then I suddenly remembered I had kept one
                    I had received from the White House after the death of Mrs. Truman's mother, and
                    sent it to Mrs. Peurifoy for her approval. It was worded very simply. “The
                    President and Mrs. Truman deeply appreciate your condolences in their great
                    loss.” She liked it very much and wanted me to have some made like it. Since the
                    quality of the paper was not very good at the stationeries here, they sent to
                    Hong Kong for some and they were here in a day. PAA rushed the order. In fact,
                    no stone has been left unturned for her. Five hundred were ordered. I have
                    answered over 400 hundred and listed where they were sent for her records.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>Today was cremation service at 9:00am. Only Mr. and Mrs. Anschutz and Mrs. Yost
                    attended. The ashes were brought back to the embassy in two golden urns from the
                    royal household, placed in the Ambassador's office, on his desk. Official
                    mourning will be for two weeks. The men are to wear white suits and black ties
                    and I am distributing black arm bands for which they pay 5 baht. The memorial
                    service is to be held tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 at the International Church. It
                    has always been traditional to have these services at Christ Church for our
                    diplomats, but Mrs. Peurifoy joined the International Church when she arrived.
                    The embassy is closing at noon. I have been trying to find out the protocol
                    regarding the dress for the ladies at the service. Mrs. Peurifoy is wearing a
                    black dress, shoes and stockings. She said the ladies could wear white if they
                    wished. But, I have just spoken to the wife of the director of protocol, and she
                    said all the Thai ladies will be in black, in fact do not consider white to be
                    mourning. They wear no hats but will be wearing stockings. I asked where one
                    would find black stockings in Bangkok and she told me of a little shop near a
                    temple or, she said she had several pairs she would be glad to lend some of the
                    ladies. Thai ladies don't wear hats, but she said, “I presume you ladies will.”
                    When I told this to Mrs. Anschutz, she said, “No, they won't, for the hats we
                    all lent the Thai ladies to wear in the United States had not been returned. I
                    don't possess any hat except for an old green velvet one so probably won't wear
                    one either. I will try to get some black stockings. Haven't had any on at all
                    since I have been here.” Everyone is so horrified and shocked over the great
                    tragedy and are eager to do anything they can for Mrs. Peurifoy has been a real
                    inspiration to us all. Must close.</p>
                <p>It is after 7:00pm and I must get back to the Club for supper which is being
                    served now and go to bed and try to get some much needed rest. Last night I sat
                    up on the edge of my bed all night just staring into the darkness too stunned to
                    sleep.</p>
                <p>August 25, 1955, Thursday, 4:30pm at the embassy.</p>
                <p>Dear Dad and Mildred.</p>
                <p>Yesterday was the saddest day I can ever remember except for the day we lost our
                    dear mother and the day we lost our dear brother, Harold. I had become so very,
                    very fond of dear Mrs. Peurifoy and felt it such a privilege.</p>
                <p>Saturday morning I went to see Clint and took him a little bunch of roses. He
                    was, of course, in traction, his legs both broken and arm in a sling and
                    bandages on his forehead. He also had an injury to his left collarbone. His
                    expression was better than I had expected. It took four nurses to give him a
                    bath. I did not stay at that time, but went back again on Sunday to read to him
                    and he looked better.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>On Monday, Bill phoned me, Dinny had had her baby, so I took a basket of pink
                    anthuriums to her and saw the infant, a girl, adorable. Just like Dinny who was
                    doing very, very well. We chatted for a while. Then I ran up to the next floor
                    to see Clint. Mrs. Peurifoy was sitting in the room quietly reading. Clint was
                    able to hold a book and read to himself and looked even better than the day
                    before. Mrs. Peurifoy offered me a ginger ale, but I thanked her and said I
                    could only stay a minute. I mentioned the clipping you, Mildred, had sent me,
                    and when she said she would like to have an extra copy to send to the
                    Ambassador's family, I gave her all you had sent me from the Washington papers.
                    It had seemed so little I could do for her.</p>
                <p>The service on Monday was beautiful. The little International Church was crowded
                    to capacity. Many seated outside. Of course, the Prime Minister and Lady Priboon
                    were there; the Foreign Minister, Prince Ran and his consort was in a long black
                    dress; the King's emissary, sat alone in a white uniform in a chair in front of
                    all the pews; Mrs. Anschutz came with Mrs. Yost; Mrs. Peurifoy's dear friend,
                    who came down from Laos when she heard the sad news; many Thai dignitaries, and
                    all members of the diplomatic corps. The choir sang beautifully her favorite
                    hymn, “Jesus Calling,” and Reverend Rayburn gave a very comforting service. I
                    could not take my eyes off of Mrs. Peurifoy, not a tear did she shed, not even a
                    handkerchief did she have in her hand. She has been absolutely wonderful
                    throughout this whole tragedy. Everyone has simply marveled at her. The
                    Pakistani Charg� rang me the next day and said he was amazed and wished his
                    women were like that. He didn't even bring his wife, he said, for he knew she
                    would break down.</p>
                <p>The official mourning, which has been for two weeks, ends tomorrow. The entire
                    community has been stunned and grieve beyond words for the Peurifoys have been
                    so popular here and the Ambassador was doing so much for Thailand. It is a most
                    appreciative country and generous. Priboon has given $10,000 for a fund at the
                    hospital to pay Clint's hospital expenses and for a reserve fun. Flowers were
                    asked not to be sent, but a contribution made towards each one's church instead
                    and a book for the little library in memory of Danny, is also desired. Of
                    course, some did send flowers. I took a little basket of orchids over to the
                    residence on the Sunday after the accident with a note. Mr. and Mrs. Anschutz,
                    of course, have been overwhelmed. Poor Mr. Anschutz comes to the office red-eyed
                    every morning but is carrying on wonderfully. Of course, everyone is speculating
                    who will be sent out as ambassador, for he would have the full cooperation and
                    backing of the entire staff. He is so kind and capable.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I went to the airport with some of the members of the staff. Admiral Stump had a
                    special plane equipped to take Clint and Mrs. Peurifoy and the ashes of the
                    Ambassador and Danny to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Again, many of the diplomatic corps and
                    Thai dignitaries were there. A red carpet was spread from the special waiting
                    room out to the plane which was not far from the terminal. There was a very
                    impressive honor guard of soldiers near the plane. The Army Attach�, Colonel
                    Cowen, and Naval Attach�, Commander McGonigal, borne the urns, now encased in
                    blue velvet. I thought, what a sad role my friend Bill McGonigal had to play in
                    this unexpected phase of his Ambassador's career. Following the two attach�s
                    came Mrs. Peurifoy, smiling to everyone in her gracious way. Of course, there
                    was a battery of cameras. She walked between Mr. and Mrs. Anschutz, up the
                    stairs of the plane and joined Clint who had previously been taken on. There was
                    a retinue of nurses and doctors who accompanied him. It was all arranged at the
                    last minute that Mrs. Cowen accompany Mrs. Peurifoy because she had been a nurse
                    and very sweet and would be a nice companion for Mrs. Peurifoy. She may come
                    back from Honolulu, or go all the way.</p>
                <p>The band played the American National Anthem, then the Thai Anthem and then there
                    was a nineteen gun salute. Mrs. Peurifoy stood there bravely, as always. Mrs.
                    Anschutz, who had been with her most of the time, rather broke down after she
                    came off the plane and Mrs. Cowen, the number two lady walked out with her arm
                    around her. I watched the plane out of sight and never felt so forsaken and
                    sad.</p>
                <p>Several spoke to me. The wife of the Counselor of the French embassy, and I spoke
                    together for some time. Then the Italian Charg� came up and Osmad, the Pakistani
                    Charg� came. Her Royal Highness, wife of a dignitary from Vietnam, who was so
                    lovely, and the wife of the deputy Prime Minister, Mrs. Roc, who is the daughter
                    of the Prime Minister. I was almost paralyzed. No words were adequate to express
                    one's feelings. Mrs. Peurifoy certainly showed everyone here what fortitude is.
                    It is the saddest day I can ever remember.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, I went home very tired at night. Then thought about this
                    terrible tragedy. Never have I wanted to understand more the mystery of life and
                    death. When I think how happy and gay we all were surrounding the Ambassador on
                    his birthday, the 9th, when there was a big cake for him in the snack bar. And,
                    of course, we all wished him a happy birthday. Then, again, at the American
                    Association luncheon shortly after. I had tipped off Marty Taylor, the
                    president, that the next meeting would fall on his birthday, so Jimmy Scott got
                    a beautiful silver cigarette box to present to him with appropriate words. Then,
                    to think a few days later his ashes would be resting in a golden urn on his desk
                    beside those of his son, little Danny.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>I completely broke down at my desk after work on Tuesday evening when the thought
                    came over me that she would be leaving the next morning with the ashes of her
                    husband and son, Danny, and Clint on a stretcher. At times like this one does
                    not like to intrude and I knew how (inaudible) she was and it would be
                    impossible to see her to say goodbye. So I wrote her the following note: “Dear
                    Mrs. Peurifoy, As I probably will not be given the opportunity of seeing you
                    again before you depart, I could not have you leave without expressing again to
                    you what is so deep in my heart. The fervent prayer that Clinton will continue
                    to improve and that you will continue to receive the God given strength which
                    thus far carried you so bravely through your sudden and tragic bereavement. You
                    have been a magnificent inspiration to everyone. May I also say how greatly I
                    have appreciated the rare privilege I have felt to be one of the members of your
                    husband's staff. The association I have had and the pleasure to have been with
                    the Ambassador and yourself will always remain one of the most cherished
                    memories in the Foreign Service. I shall especially miss hearing your cherry
                    voice over the telephone, dear Mrs. Peurifoy, for I have regarded you with great
                    affection and esteem. May God bless you and Clinton to be with you on your
                    homeward journey. Most sincerely, Virginia Biddle.”</p>
                <p>I took it to the residence and gave it to the number one boy who said he would
                    take it to her at the hospital in the morning. The residence was absolutely
                    deserted and my heart sank when I saw the lift vans and emptiness of what so
                    recently had been so happy and gay a place.</p>
                <p>I gave up my Manila trip. I just simply couldn't leave at the moment when Mrs.
                    Peurifoy needed me more. I wanted to be here to do all that I possibly could for
                    her. So I sent a cable to Florence Barrington. I am sure she understood for she
                    had already sent a cable to Mrs. Peurifoy when the sad news reached her.</p>
                <p>So, I am taking a different kind of holiday, but one which will be exactly what I
                    need now. I am leaving Saturday noon on the Banseramsy which takes about 12 or
                    13 passengers down to the Gulf of Siam, touching several little places on the
                    coast and some of the picturesque islands in the Gulf. Some of the embassy
                    people have just returned and give it a good recommendation. The first stop will
                    be Songkhla where I stopped on my way to Pinang. When I saw the magnificent
                    scenery from the plane, I was determined I would someday take the boat trip. It
                    is so cheap that I decided I could take the one deluxe cabin alone. It takes
                    about ten days and the regular price is only 600 baht, about $30. I am paying
                    about $63. It will be something like cruising in the south seas and will be
                    restful and relaxing. I am taking some reading and hope to come back
                    refreshed.</p>
                <p>American embassy, September 7, 1955</p>
                <p>Dears,</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Back from my trip through the Gulf of Siam feeling so refreshed after my ten day
                    holiday. We sailed 2:00pm on Saturday, August 27 and I found there were only
                    three other passengers besides myself. A couple from USOM, Mr. and Mrs. Travell
                    and a British civil service chap, Brian, about 25, who had been sent to Thailand
                    to learn the language. So it was like being on our own yacht.</p>
                <p>The native people and their produce had settled themselves neatly below decks on
                    their mats. The decks were filled with bananas, beetle nut and all kinds of
                    baskets. Mr. Travell had brought three cases of beer aboard. I had brought a few
                    snacks but wished I had brought more for our tea. The food was exceptionally
                    good. There was plenty of deck space where white wicker furniture was
                    placed—tables, chairs, chaise lounge—and striped canvas on deck chairs for those
                    wishing to sleep out on deck. I had one placed outside my cabin and slept nearly
                    every night outside.</p>
                <p>We were some time getting out of the muddy river to the Gulf. We passed the
                    French embassy, Portuguese legation and Oriental Hotel. It was interesting to
                    see the places from the river. When we reached Klong Toi I suddenly realized
                    that it was here I met the 400 passengers coming off the boat. The entire Thai
                    fleet was tied up here and Mr. Travell, who was always so informative, explained
                    each type of ship to me. Their one destroyer was sunk in the war with Korea. The
                    Thai captain, who could only speak a few words of English, had been the captain
                    on the (Inaudible). It was lovely to see the little houses on stilts and the
                    napa and mangrove growing right out of the water on the river's edge and all
                    kinds of craft on the water.</p>
                <p>Late in the afternoon we began to see sampans with sails made of matting. The
                    captain said we would pass Hua Hin about midnight and would be about 35 miles
                    from shore. I was just as glad it would be midnight because I don't think I
                    would ever be happy seeing that place again. For now it only holds tragic
                    memories.</p>
                <p>We passed a dredge. Mr. Travell thought it was one where the Prime Minister was
                    kidnapped from in 1951 which caused the unsuccessful coup. I noticed flowered
                    leis and joss sticks on the bow of the ship which I think is a Buddhist custom
                    and reminded me of Halliburton's Chinese junk, similarly decorated, we saw put
                    out to sea when we arrived in Hong Kong. It was good to reach green waters and
                    fun to watch our course on the bridge for never have I had the privilege of
                    spending so much time on a ship's bridge before.</p>
                <p>We reached Songkhla about 4:00 in the afternoon and Brian wanted to go to the
                    British consulate to sign the book. So we took samlars and rowed in the
                    moonlight to the residence. It was suggested that he run in and we would wait.
                    But he called out to us shortly to say they wanted us to come in for a drink.
                    The Consul and his wife were charming. We chatted a bit, and, of course, the
                    Consul's wife spoke of the horrible tragedy to our Ambassador, nor did Brian
                    ever sign the book for there wasn't one. But we enjoyed the little visit very
                    much.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>Back to the ship and I was lulled to sleep by a deck passenger playing softly on
                    a bamboo flute. At 6:00 in the morning I awakened to see the Malayan baydar,
                    those picturesque sailing ships, coming towards us with their cargo. When they
                    reached our ship they lowered their sails and began loading dried salted
                    vegetables in large earthen jars from China. At no port were we able to tie up.
                    Each time we went ashore we went ashore in a different type of boat. This time
                    we got into what looked like an old paddle boat, but much smaller. In fact, the
                    water was so shallow, the boatman got out and pulled us to shore. The Malayans
                    are the seamen in the south of Thailand. It was an hour and a half before we
                    reached the little town of Pattani, which used to be a famous port three or four
                    hundred years ago. When we arrived arrangements were made to hire a car to take
                    us to the points of interests which were the caves and waterfalls. Afterwards a
                    Chinese lunch eaten with chopsticks overlooking the town. I was so fascinated by
                    the women and their colorful native dress and the Malay so prevalent here. The
                    casual nonchalance with which they tossed their gay colored things around their
                    heads and let them fall down so gracefully over their shoulders. And on top of
                    their heads carried trays of tropical fruit. Each are a perfect model for
                    Gauguin. The grace of their carriage reminded me of the Balinese and Javanese
                    women, lovely to behold.</p>
                <p>We started out in this car with a native driver hell bent for heaven and no
                    persuasion could make him slow down so we could see the scenery and people.
                    Small rubber plantations and napa huts. When the driver was not tearing along
                    like mad, he was stopped with the hood up looking into the engine, too frequent
                    for comfort. But, we finally made it to the caves by mounting a long flight of
                    steps similar to the ones we had seen at Pedge Buri, full of Buddha images. I
                    longed to see the birds that were making such unusual sounds in this quiet,
                    peaceful place. It was some distance to the waterfall up in the mountains where
                    we ran into a shower. But, we didn't mind, in fact, loved it for it was a better
                    shower than we could have in the first-class lady's room on the ship.It was fun
                    bathing in the tiny pool under the waterfall, around the rocks. We had
                    sandwiches in the car and I had brought limeade in my thermos.</p>
                <p>We arrived at Tukby early the next morning, the last port in Thailand on the
                    border of Malay. Before we could finish breakfast, a life boat was being lowered
                    to take us ashore. Mrs. Travell and I changed into our bathing suits behind the
                    sand dune. It looked first like a scene on a desert island. Thatched roofed huts
                    where no one seemed to be stirring and typical south sea islands. We browsed
                    through the village after our heavenly swim, but found nothing but an odd
                    assortment of European goods, flashlight, fruit and washing powder and a
                    conglomeration of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Back to the ship and watched them loading smelly shrimp paste. Sailed about
                    8:30pm. The Danish engineer, Mr. Nelson, who had been with the company 36 years
                    and the only European on the ship, came up for tea one day and then frequently
                    thereafter. He arranged for us to have a car the next day to take us to a
                    waterfall that seemed to be the only point of interest. This car, something like
                    a station wagon, had all of its seats removed and, in fact, replaced by rattan
                    chairs. We drove 28 miles over a road like a washboard and our conversation
                    sounded as if we were all losing our front, back and side teeth. There were 28
                    bridges and we came to one where they were putting in some new logs and we
                    couldn't cross it until it was finished. We promptly took out the chairs and
                    thermos bottles and Mr. T. even got out his case of beer and planted ourselves
                    on the edge of the bridge and made ourselves comfortable until it was finished.
                    It was all quite amusing. Mr. Nelson, to add a little zest to the occasion, said
                    there were tigers in the hills.</p>
                <p>The waterfall was lovely and again had a delightful swim and hiked up to the top
                    where there was a little Buddhist shrine. We picnicked on a rock beside the fall
                    and watched a family of black baboons with long tails jumping from tree to tree.
                    We browsed again in the tiny village and I picked up a couple of sarongs.
                    Returning we passed over the most colorful Malayan boats painted bright yellow,
                    blue and orange, near a palm fringed island and the boatmen waved to us
                    gaily.</p>
                <p>Back on the ship we were invited to a Chinese dinner given by the compodore, sort
                    of a high class stevedore, in celebration of the Chinese ancestor worship. We
                    had scotch throughout the dinner followed by cognac. I knew only one word in
                    Thai and it was “delicious,” so I felt I could show my appreciation to these
                    people. Under the captain there was the compodores, assistant and two custom
                    officers who had boarded the ship to watch the rubber we had taken on, to see
                    that we took it to Bangkok and not to Singapore or some place else.</p>
                <p>The ship loaded cargo all night and now I am just beginning to get whiffs of the
                    smell of copra, so reminiscing of the south seas and that sweet sickly odor
                    reminded me of Tahiti. The men had to count each coconut before it was put in
                    the hold or in a rocky...</p>
                <p>All through the night I heard them counting, etc. until I thought I would go
                    nuts, but at least I learned to count up to ten in Thai. It was a beautiful moon
                    light night and the breezes were balmy and we followed gleaming, sandy beaches,
                    tall palms with mountains behind. The simplest things became of enormous
                    interest as the days went by. I read a lot and slept a lot and became very lazy.
                    It was a perfect type of holiday for me at this particular time. I loved to hear
                    the Thai boy singing out the depth of water each time we would stop. They called
                    it the stringing of the lead.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>When we returned to Songkhla, a Thai couple boarded. The gentleman spoke English
                    and when I heard they were from Chiang Mai, I asked him if he knew the Prince of
                    Chiang Mai, who had taken me to see the old temples. He said he did. The next
                    day he produced some photos of the Prince and his wife swimming in the
                    waterfall. I was sorry I did not have with me the one that was taken with him at
                    one of the temples.</p>
                <p>We made several stops at the coconut islands, no road connecting any of the
                    little villages. The only way was to bicycle or go by foot. We were really in an
                    uncivilized part of the world. The people all stared. Some of the babies ran
                    from us in the villages. We were probably not too often seen. The scenery was
                    absolutely magnificent on the homeward run. Something like out of a Wagnerian
                    opera. The dark blue tones over the mountains, the islands gave them a very
                    dramatic appearance. We stopped at several fishing villages and saw a great many
                    fishing traps in the water. But we were never on schedule. In fact, I didn't get
                    back in time for the American Association luncheon. As we passed the Oriental
                    Hotel, I could see the long tables set up as Mrs. Roosevelt had been asked to
                    speak. But, I felt I looked like a weather-beaten lady from the hinterland and
                    had to get my hair done before I could put in an appearance because I knew the
                    entire diplomatic corps would be there, plus a lot of the Thai dignitaries. I
                    had prepared everything for the president in the event I didn't get back.</p>
                <p>When we handed in our chits for the extras aboard, after one coke, an orange
                    drink, etc., it read “How about 24 bob?” I thought it was the final touch of
                    humor until I found I had to disembark through the holds of the ship. They had
                    to move cargo to let me off.</p>
                <p>After I got thoroughly civilized looking again at the Tock Hotel, where I had my
                    hair done and a shower and lunch at the American Club, I went to the embassy to
                    find nearly everyone had gone to the American Association luncheon at the
                    Oriental. I didn't mind too much missing Mrs. Roosevelt this time, because I had
                    remembered hearing her when I was a nurse's aide in Washington during the war
                    and what great charm she had.</p>
                <p>I am bronze and rested and will now have new energy for making arrangements for
                    our trip to India, Mildred.</p>
                <p>Just received from Sheridan Logan a clipping from the New York Times dated August
                    8, of the death of Mrs. John Hubbard in Paris on the 6th. A long article all
                    about her many activities and her photograph. I am crushed beyond words. As you
                    know I adored her and she was so dear to me. The papers did not say what caused
                    her death so I wrote to Marcelle L'Conte to inquire for me. I also sent a note
                    of condolences to her granddaughter, Mrs. Clarence McCaylus at Mrs. Hubbard's
                    address where I had been entertained when in New York.</p>
                <p>September 22, 1955</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I know you have been anxiously waiting to hear from me. Plans are shaping up for
                    our trip to India. After the Pakistani Minister had spoken at the American
                    Association luncheon, Mr. Setti, the Charg� d'Affaires of the Indian embassy,
                    took me to see Dr. Gangi, their press secretary, who Mr. Mennen, their
                    ambassador now in India, had introduced me to, and asked me to see when I got
                    ready to go. He said that Kashmir wouldn't be pretty at that time of year,
                    besides the roads might be impassible. People, if they can get there at all, go
                    to ski. I believe Delhi will be cold enough. He warned me it could be snowing.
                    Please have Sue Parish bring me a warm dress, a nightgown, when you see her.</p>
                <p>Today, an airgram came to my desk and I thought the name rang a bell. It said the
                    Honorable and Mrs. Higley were going to the dedication ceremonies, the opening
                    of the veterans' memorial hospital in Quezon City and would return to the United
                    States via Asia and the Near East and Europe. We were asked to make reservations
                    for them for the night of November 29. They leave the 30th. I shall tell Mr.
                    Anschutz that is your boss and that you decorated his office, for I remember the
                    letter of commendation he had written you after it was done. I will get a room
                    for them at the Oriental and meet them at the airport.</p>
                <p>September 28, 1955</p>
                <p>Just heard we now have APO privileges and hasten to send you the news for now
                    packages can reach me in about six weeks against two and a half months via the
                    diplomatic pouch. But letters come faster by open mail rather than via APO. I
                    get yours in about eight days.</p>
                <p>Susan Frost Parish, our cultural affairs officer, is due back the end of October.
                    She is adorable and everyone here loves her and her house and garden.</p>
                <p>At the Embassy, Saturday, October 8, 1955</p>
                <p>To Dad and Mildred,</p>
                <p>I have been asked to write up my trip on the Gulf of Siam for our little weekly
                    bulletin. So glad you got a map and could follow my trip and so nice of you to
                    be so interested and getting books on the places where I am and found when I
                    come home you are sometimes better informed on the countries than I am,
                    myself.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Now the rains are getting heavier, but it is getting cooler so the fans are used
                    less and the light blankets a little more. I have been trying to ward off a cold
                    by going to bed as soon as I get home every evening in order not to miss a day
                    at the office for I hate to spoil my record of not having had a day's sick leave
                    since I have been here. I probably have been over tired too, for I have been
                    working hard on a list of prominent Thai in Bangkok. It is finished now and will
                    be extremely valuable to everyone. I had to list the office addresses and
                    telephone numbers and their home addresses and telephone numbers, which is not
                    easy, especially when the names can be spelled several different ways. Then,
                    too, I was trying to get out my Christmas cards for the pouch, and a long list I
                    have, too.</p>
                <p>You asked how things were going to be now after the Ambassador's death. In my
                    particular case I find a great deal of the glamour missing from my job. Mrs.
                    Peurifoy, who was so sweet and gracious and charming, required me to do many
                    things for her. Arranging her calls and party lists, and I was there almost
                    every Wednesday for her at-homes, meeting people and assisting her and sending
                    out her invitations. Now, all that is finished until a new ambassador comes. The
                    embassy is in very capable hands as Mr. Anschutz is now Charg� d'Affaires. His
                    wife, Roberta, is very pleasant, too. I arrange her calls, but Mr. Anschutz'
                    secretary, pretty Georgia Marlow, has taken over their social engagements. There
                    is not so much for her to do now, with the Ambassador's secretary, June Acough,
                    still here.</p>
                <p>I find I keep so much healthier in tropical climates and it is so important when
                    one has a job to do.</p>
                <p>Tell Perle Mesta I loved the article you sent me about her impressions of Russia—
                    “They cannot survive because they do not seem to believe in God.”</p>
                <p>Sorry I did not know George Williams was here at the time of the Ambassador's
                    death, but at that time everyone was so distressed they couldn't be normal. I
                    read in the paper the funeral service will be in Arlington on Thursday. I am
                    longing to know if you met Mrs. Peurifoy. I am sure you would try if you
                    possibly could. I read of all the Thai dignitaries who were there.</p>
                <p>I think we should make our hotel reservations at Agra as soon as possible, for I
                    read somewhere, “when the dining room was full, the moon is full.” Mr. Anschutz
                    has approved my leave from December 16 - January 3. Someone has said it would be
                    very nice if we could arrange to stay at the Maharajah's guest house in
                    Jodhpur.</p>
                <p>At home, October 13, 1955, Thursday</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>The doctor has advised that I stay at home for a couple of days because I was
                    feeling so tired. Not really ill in any way, but followed his orders reluctantly
                    for I hated to spoil my record of not having taken any sick leave in over the
                    year I have been here. But, I suppose it is time now, and I am beginning to feel
                    debilitated from the heat. He is giving me B12 shots in the hip and I am taking
                    yeast tablets besides my usual vitamins, so I should be picking up shortly.</p>
                <p>When you see Perle Mesta, ask her if her instructions (inaudible). I spoke with
                    Mr. Setti, the Charg�, personally about it, to contact the embassy in New Delhi
                    to see that she had the interview.</p>
                <p>I planned our itinerary in India to be in New Delhi on December 24-25, as I
                    thought it would be more gay and to put us near the Taj nearer the full moon
                    time. I suggest we leave Banaras one day earlier, more fun than staying in
                    Calcutta, in order to get to Rangoon where you say Malek has a friend who can
                    give us a beautiful party on New Year's Eve.</p>
                <p>I met at the airport one day, Mrs. Satterthwaite's, the wife of the Ambassador,
                    when she was on route to join him in Rangoon. He had just been transferred there
                    from Tangier and we found we had several mutual friends in Morocco.</p>
                <p>I have been reading an excellent book on India called, “This is India,” by Rama
                    Rawl, an Indian woman married to an American, Phelbian Bowers, who writes about
                    the Oriental theater. Then, another book by a Frenchman called, “Diamonds and
                    Dust.” And now, “Lancer at Large,” by Yeats Brown. I am taking notes, and there
                    is so much to know about that vast country.</p>
                <p>I have been asking Herman Seiler, the manager, to fix up the room across from me
                    for your special visit and he promises me he will.</p>
                <p>At the airport, October 16, 1955, Sunday, 12:30pm</p>
                <p>I have come to the airport to meet Penny Robinson, the secretary to the Naval
                    Attach� in Saigon, who was so nice to me there. Bill McGonigal had a letter from
                    her saying she was coming through today on route to the United States via the
                    Middle East and Europe, for home leave. Then she is being transferred to
                    Melbourne. Bill couldn't come because the deputy Prime Minister had invited him
                    somewhere, so he sent his car and chauffeur to pick me up at Dinny Phelps, where
                    I have been spending the weekend. I will take her to lunch and see what she
                    wants to do until 6:00 when Bill hopes to see her.</p>
                <p>When I arrived at Dinny's on Friday, was greeted with the news that her number
                    one servant had gone and only had a new wash amah, so with the new baby needing
                    to be feed every four hours and no servant in the house I was kept busy trying
                    to help her.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Mildred, I was so touched to read the wonderful letter describing the services at
                    Arlington for Ambassador Peurifoy. I wept when I read that you did go and did
                    meet Mrs. Peurifoy, for I know you too would love her.</p>
                <p>October 18, 1955</p>
                <p>Had luncheon with Penny Robinson on Sunday and again on Monday at Bill
                    McGonigal's. She was to see Ambassador and Mrs. Heath in Beirut.</p>
                <p>Charlie wrote me the Ambassador had written such a nice letter when he was let
                    out with him at the embassy in Saigon.</p>
                <p>The padre has invited me to the St. Andrew's Ball the end of November and a
                    buffet at his house.</p>
                <p>Tell Perle Mesta, the dinner the Ambassador gave for her was the last large
                    dinner they had before his tragic, fatal accident. I was checking through his
                    files the other day and it gave me a pang to see the guest list on top of the
                    files and nothing since. I was so pleased I had been invited.</p>
                <p>At the Embassy, October 22, 1955, Saturday, 4:30pm</p>
                <p>I have come over here to the embassy to work on our trip to India. Lady
                    MacFalgher, whose husband, Sir Alexander, is with the United Nations here and
                    lived there for years and invited me over at 6:00 on Thursday to give me some
                    notes. I liked her the minute I met her at one of the American Association
                    luncheons when she reminded me so much of my friend in Paris, Princess Conderov
                    Barris. She gave me a note of introduction to an Indian friend of hers whose
                    sister is the Ambassador for Pakistan at the Hague and whose husband was Prime
                    Minister and assassinated in 1951. She is writing that I am coming.</p>
                <p>I am about to subscribe to Holiday. There is an article in the October issue on
                    Siam by a friend of Mr. Lescher with our USIS here.</p>
                <p>This morning I went over to the church to help decorate it for the harvest
                    festival, and it does look lovely. This is a long weekend as Monday is a
                    holiday, but the rains deter one from making many plans. A group of people had
                    to give up going to Hua Hin for the roads were all under water and also the
                    railroad tracks and even the airport. I was sorry for them, but I have no desire
                    to return there any more.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>I am invited to the Prime Minister's reception on Monday evening, United Nations
                    Day. Then, next Saturday, I am going to a costume party, Halloween. I got out my
                    Japanese bride's kimono, but decided it would be too hot, so decided to wear a
                    red and white sarong I bought in the Fiji Islands in 1939 and make leis of the
                    frangipani that is now in bloom and keep cool. On November 10th the Marines give
                    their annual dance and the 26th is the ball for the benefit of the blind. And,
                    then the St. Andrews Ball, which is quite a social event. This begins the social
                    season here, though it really never ends.</p>
                <p>Bill Phelps tells me P.D. Howard wants to take me to the Masonic Ball where we
                    had such fun together last year.</p>
                <p>October 26, 1955</p>
                <p>Mildred,</p>
                <p>Just a hurried note to ask if you would like to arrange to stay over in Rangoon
                    and take a trip up to Mandalay. I have spoken with several who have been there
                    and I, for my part, would like very much to go if you would. I hear the USIS
                    officer has a lovely house where he puts up guests. I have such poignant
                    memories of reciting as a child Kipling's “On the Road to Mandalay,” and it
                    would be fun to see, “where the flying fishes play and the dawn comes up like
                    thunder out of China across the bay,” although they say it really doesn't.</p>
                <p>November 4, 1955</p>
                <p>I have written to Don Rogers, the vice consul in Rangoon regarding staying in the
                    house of the public affairs officer in Mandalay.</p>
                <p>November 7, 1955</p>
                <p>Glad to hear you talked with Madame Mesta and that she had a one hour interview
                    with Nehru and that a new nurse is coming to the embassy, Joan Carter, and a
                    darling.</p>
                <p>November 8, 1955</p>
                <p>Regarding the rate at the American Club, I pay $6.42 per day and that includes
                    three meals, plus tea and cocktails and sandwiches and a limeade known as a
                    Nominau I have afterwards on the veranda.</p>
                <p>At the Embassy, November 12, 1955, Saturday</p>
                <p>Came to the embassy to continue writing my Christmas cards. Deeply touched to
                    receive such a sweet letter from Mrs. Peurifoy.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>November 14, 1955</p>
                <p>Going to a church committee tonight. Was put on the church council by Bill
                    Phelps. The costume party was fun. Wore my sarong, tucked a flower behind my
                    ear, made anklet of flowers and carried a basket of fruit and flowers. I could
                    have managed to carry it on my head but wouldn't have been able to dance. And
                    went barefooted and kept cool.</p>
                <p>I went to the Marine Ball with some people from the embassy after we had gone to
                    the airport to see the chief of USOM, Mr. Sponiler and his wife off.</p>
                <p>Bill and Dinny are coming to have Thanksgiving dinner with me at the Club, so
                    shall not be going away that long weekend, saving all my pennies for the trip to
                    India.</p>
                <p>November 18, 1955</p>
                <p>I am having dinner with Lea Knot, who used to life in India, and returning there
                    soon, so will glean more information. I am taking the Phelps and Baron von
                    Plason to the Martha Graham dance recital. I have been invited to the Pickerings
                    for supper. He is head of USIS and entertaining the troop after the
                    performance.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Allen asked me to come to Phnom Penh in Cambodia for Thanksgiving but had
                    already invited the Phelps.</p>
                <p>We have a series of Congressmen coming now and lots of invitations to write, so
                    must stop.</p>
                <p>November 21, 1955</p>
                <p>Mildred,</p>
                <p>Just had a nice letter from Betty Purdy, enclosing check for $5 for us to do
                    something on Christmas eve in India. Perhaps we must buy some champagne or have
                    a cocktail to toast her. We must have peds for the temples. I will bring some
                    for you, if you don't have any.</p>
                <p>At Embassy, November 27, 1955</p>
                <p>These days are absolutely heavenly now, cool like California. The fans not going
                    so much and have donned sweaters for going to work.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>About 300 were at the Masonic Ball and P.D. Howard took me with the Phelps. They
                    always have lovely gifts for the ladies. This year they were especially pretty,
                    George Jenson pins. I was so pleased because I have always wanted some George
                    Jenson silver. The ladies were all in long dresses and I wore my new ball gown I
                    bought in Pinang, white net with black lace, and danced nearly every dance and
                    didn't get home until 3:45 in the morning.</p>
                <p>Mildred, the Phelps told me about the dinner they want to give for you while
                    here. They are inviting the Bishop, who will be here to christen their new born
                    baby, the Rev. and Mrs. Gillmore, the Lord Mayor of Bangkok, whose wife is
                    Princess (Inaudible), sister of Prince Sawan, the Thai Foreign Minister, who is
                    now in the United States, and Baron von Plason and P.D. Howard, and the German
                    couple who live next door, Mr. and Mrs. Haft. They have asked me to be the proxy
                    godmother for Susan Elizabeth at the christening on Sunday, January 9 at 4:00pm.
                    I felt very honored and they hoped you would be here for the small christening
                    party after.</p>
                <p>The Higleys are due Tuesday. Mrs. Anschutz and I will meet them and I shall put
                    on an orchid in their room for Mrs. Higley to wear to the Anschutzes' dinner
                    they are giving for them that evening. I will add your name to the card.</p>
                <p>January 9, 1956, Monday</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred</p>
                <p>Have just returned to my room to find your dear sweet note which has touched me
                    very deeply. I have been thinking of you so much since I waved you goodbye this
                    morning. Had a sandwich at the snack bar and went back to my office. Many asked
                    about you and said what a success my party had been. At 4:30 went to the tea at
                    the parsonage and sat at a table with Mr. Mark Jackson and some English girls.
                    The Bishop spoke as did the padre, both with great humor. The British
                    Ambassador, Sir Barclay Gage and Lady Gage, were also there. I went with Dinny
                    and Bill. After to Bill Brownsey's who was the treasurer, but resigning, another
                    English chap who was there and very witty. We laughed and laughed.</p>
                <p>The Phelps are giving a cocktail party for the British Charg� who is leaving.</p>
                <p>I, too, thought we had such a wonderful trip together, Mildred, and do feel so
                    let down, but it will be nice to look forward to rejoining you before too very
                    long.</p>
                <p>January 11, 1956</p>
                <p>Busy now arranging calls for the new ambassador, Max Bishop.</p>
                <p>January 16, 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>The Ambassador is giving four parties this week so had to dash in a hurry then
                    spent all Saturday morning addressing the envelopes with the secretary of Mr.
                    Conover and then requested special messenger to deliver them. He is speaking at
                    the next American Association luncheon, so I have busy times ahead. Went to
                    church as usual at 8:00 and kept thinking of last Sunday when I was so happy to
                    have you by my side.</p>
                <p>January 17, 1956</p>
                <p>After the church council meeting last evening, Bill and Dinny, and Bill Brownsey,
                    the red haired Englishman who was the resigning treasurer and so much fun, and I
                    went to the Jacksons for a drink. Then, to the Phelps for dinner to see the
                    pictures of the christening.</p>
                <p>Official mourning for the Queen Grandmother is over. When you arrived in Bangkok
                    you may have noticed all of the diplomatic corps were wearing black ties and
                    mourning bands due to the death of the 92-year-old Queen Grandmother of the
                    King.</p>
                <p>Dad, dear, I forgot to tell you that I bought with the $5 you were so sweet to
                    send me for Christmas a little silver box in India for my box collection. I love
                    it as it has the Mongol design and the flower on it that is in the Taj Mahal and
                    will be such a pleasant souvenir of that exquisitely beautiful world famous
                    place. How I wish you could have seen it with Mildred and me.</p>
                <p>January 18, 1956</p>
                <p>Last evening Bill Phelps sent their car for me for their cocktail party. When
                    Baron von Plason arrived he said he had also stopped for me. I thought how kind.
                    They had a few people in to say goodbye to the Charg� of the British embassy and
                    sat in the garden. There I met the Blacks. It is he who was lecturing at the
                    Siam Society on 19th century old ruins near the border of Siam and Cambodia.
                    They are said to be older than Angkor Wat and both countries are claiming it. I
                    am taking that nice girl, Shirley Herd from the Australian embassy as my
                    guest.</p>
                <p>January 20, 1956</p>
                <p>Received a letter from Mr. Liper in Mandalay saying he was sorry he could not
                    have been there when we arrived, but was called to Rangoon unexpectedly for
                    consultation, but hoped we enjoyed ourselves. Clem Dillar he said was most
                    pleased to be with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>Mr. Black's lecture was most interesting on a sanctuary now in ruins dating from
                    the 9th century. Prince Donni introduced him and Dr. Spinks, from our USIS, gave
                    him words of thanks after. Marjorie Lescher was there and said her husband had
                    been to this place. I should have loved to see it, but apparently it is
                    frightfully difficult to get to. Must go over rough roads in a jeep and very few
                    have been there. Mr. Black was telling me at the Phelps that now that the French
                    are no longer in that part of the world, they do not know how those temples of
                    Angkor Wat, for instance, will keep preserved for the Cambodians, themselves, do
                    not care about keeping them up.</p>
                <p>My little Austrian friend, Friedel, called and wants me to meet her for a swim at
                    the Sports Club on Sunday. She dashes around Bangkok on a motorbike and shares a
                    house with the secretary of the Danish Minister.</p>
                <p>January 23, 1956</p>
                <p>I was invited to dinner at the Joseph Goulds. They had a young man there who was
                    a pilot on the MATS plane and who pilots all the VIPs. This time he had the
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense, Godell, and his party and will take our
                    Ambassador back to the States to get his wife, who has just had her third child.
                    He is speaking at the American Association luncheon tomorrow. Mr. Scott is
                    planning for 300 so I will be busy arranging the sitting for the VIPs.</p>
                <p>January 25, 1956</p>
                <p>I was rushed off my feet getting the seating arrangements made for the American
                    Association luncheon at the Oriental where our new Ambassador, Max Bishop, was
                    speaking. There were 290 and I had to arrange 50 to be seated according to
                    protocol. The Prime Minister and Madame Priboon came and many members of the
                    Thai cabinet and nearly all of the chiefs of mission. He spoke very well and
                    sounded down to earth.</p>
                <p>After I got everyone seated, I just dropped down in any vacant seat available and
                    who should I fine myself seated across the table from in that enormous crowd of
                    290, but a Mr. Sperry from the National City Bank in Hong Kong. None other than
                    Hank Sperry, who I had heard about for ages. He said he had tried to look me up
                    in the embassy but couldn't find me, not knowing I would be at the Oriental in
                    the throes of seating 50 VIPs for our Ambassador's first appearance at the
                    American Association luncheon. He said Don Keating, an Englishman in their
                    office, had heard from Charlie just a week ago and mentioned that a branch of
                    the Bank had been opened in Beirut.</p>
                <p>After I went back to my office and worked on the Ambassador's list for a dinner
                    he was giving in honor of the Prime Minister and his party of 34 that he had
                    taken with him to the United States. Toi Cunjara was invited with her mother and
                    father, and I thanked her for taking us to the emerald Buddha.</p>

                <p>Prince Sawan, the Foreign Minister, returns the 30th and will be the next speaker
                    on the 7th of February, so that will be another big seating arrangement for me
                    to do.</p>
                <p>January 27, 1956</p>
                <p>Last evening I was invited to dinner at the Rocholtz. Mr. Rocholtz is the manager
                    of Caltech, and acting president of the American Association. There must have
                    been about ten couples there. It was buffet and we ate at small tables. The nice
                    young chap, Mr. Doherty, who was seated next to me on the plane coming to
                    Bangkok, was there.</p>
                <p>We had not seen each other since we had arrived here on August 28, so we compared
                    notes on how we liked Bangkok. Both agreed that we did like it. Also there was
                    the Charg� d'Affaires of the Belgian legation, the former Charg� of the Austrian
                    legation, who sat at my table with his Vietnamese wife who had great charm, as I
                    have found all the Austrians to have. A couple visiting from Stanford University
                    traveling around the world and a Mrs. Conover, whose husband was at a conference
                    in Bangalore.</p>
                <p>January 31, 1956</p>
                <p>The embassy received an airgram the other day that John W. Hauser is arriving
                    February 10 to see about building a Hilton Hotel here. I don't know if it ever
                    materialized.</p>
                <p>Received such a nice note from Mr. Higley. Mr. Anschutz is again Charg� until the
                    Ambassador returns with his wife and three children on February 13. Poor Bill
                    McGonigal is in the hospital with pneumonia.</p>
                <p>There is a lecture at the Siam Society on Burma this Friday, which will interest
                    me more than ever. I am taking June Acough as my guest.</p>
                <p>February 8, 1956</p>
                <p>Prince Sawan spoke at the American Association luncheon yesterday where I had
                    arranged seating for 44 members of the diplomatic corps and important Thai. The
                    popularity of the Americans here is very great and funnily enough this time I
                    again sat across from someone who knew Charlie, a visitor from Singapore. A most
                    attractive Dutchman who has lived years in the Orient and had known Yeti's first
                    husband. It is beginning to be uncanny.</p>
                <p>Dinny Phelps is going to Hong Kong on the JUSMAAG plane Saturday, but we are not
                    allowed to travel on it. Tailors in Hong Kong are like dentists, everyone has
                    his favorite to recommend and you don't know which one to choose.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>February 13, 1956</p>
                <p>Mr. and Mrs. Sistonovich sent out amusing invitations to a costume party to
                    celebrate the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln. They dressed as Abe Lincoln and
                    his wife. I decided to go as Marie Antoinette, for in my long black lace and
                    white net ball gown all I thought I needed would be a wig and a diamond
                    necklace. But, alas, not so easy. I couldn't find a wig, so with Dinny's help
                    piled high rolls of cotton, then tied a black velvet ribbon around it, tucked in
                    a pink French flower and draped it with strands of pearls. The jeweler Ainsley,
                    kindly lent me a brilliant necklace for the occasion. When I started to leave
                    the American Club for the party, I knew I could not get into one of the tiny
                    taxis they have here so I asked a Chinese boy to have a large one sent. When he
                    saw my costume and towering headdress, he politely asked and in all sincerity,
                    “Madame, would you like me to call a truck?” I was so amused and thought the
                    truck might be the appropriate way to arrive, after all—Marie Antoinette on her
                    way to the guillotine.</p>
                <p>When I arrived at the Sistonoviches, they said, “Hello Martha,” thinking I was
                    Martha Washington and also was called Betsy Ross and Dolly Madison, which were
                    more appropriate as they were American historical characters and what I should
                    have called myself. But, I wasn't the only one not recognized quite accurately.
                    The British Ambassador, Sir Barclay Gage said to me, “You wouldn't know I was
                    Clive of India, would you?” He just had a red cummerbund around his waist.
                    Another man was dressed as Caesar, but said very indignantly, “I am not Caesar,
                    I am Brutus!” Sue Parish came as Narcissus wearing bath towels and a mirror tied
                    around her neck and kept looking at herself. Some wit said, “Are you a near
                    sighted chariot driver, or what?” I asked one woman what she was and she said,
                    “Well, I'm off a postage stamp, the woman who fought off all the Burmese.” “The
                    King and I” was represented. A Thai came as the King and his English wife as the
                    governess, Anna.</p>
                <p>The most amusing couple who arrived came as a pink elephant which depicted a real
                    historic episode. The Siamese government had sent Abraham Lincoln two pink
                    elephants when he was in office.</p>
                <p>Even the music was of the time, played on an old clavichord. The host and hostess
                    sounded just as Abe and wife might by saying “Won't you come into the parlor and
                    dance.” Lincoln's picture was hanging on the wall in the parlor and actually
                    bore a striking resemblance to the host. The Sistonoviches had been posted in
                    Italy and Palermo where George Palmer is now. There house, with attractive
                    object d'art reflected their sojourn there. I enjoyed meeting the well-known
                    writer, James Michener, who was a guest there with his attractive
                    Japanese-American bride.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>A few days later, Mrs. Sistonovich rang to ask if I still had my wig I wore to
                    the costume party and when I said yes, she asked if I could come over at 6:30pm,
                    they were going to take some pictures. They were asking as many with interesting
                    costumes as they could. I had returned my diamond necklace to Ainsley, but
                    thought it wouldn't matter too much, as long as I had my wig on. The photo
                    appeared in the Foreign Service Journal.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow I am going to the Phillips for cocktails. He is our administrative
                    officer, and his wife formerly designed clothes for Elizabeth Arden. Then, on
                    Friday invited to the cocktail party the Japanese Ambassador and Mrs. Ota are
                    having to bid farewell to his friends as he is being transferred to Rome. Next
                    Monday there is a party at the Ledekers given in honor of someone off the
                    Cumshome that memorable ship that brought so many celebrities I had to meet last
                    year.</p>
                <p>Our Ambassador is due to arrive this afternoon with his wife and new baby and two
                    other children. Dinny's trip to Hong Kong was postponed due to the SEATO
                    maneuvers.</p>
                <p>February 15, 1956</p>
                <p>Just heard we are to have a holiday tomorrow and Friday because of the SEATO
                    maneuvers. It makes a wonderfully long weekend but at this late date don't know
                    what plans to make. Rang Bill to ask what they were doing. He and Dinny were
                    planning to go out to the airport to see the display and asked me to go with
                    them. The most spectacular was the drop of 600 parachutists. We had a picnic
                    lunch under a nearby wat. Last evening at the Phillips' cocktail party, Sir
                    Alexander MacFalgher, asked if you, Mildred, got home all right. You may recall
                    it was his wife who had given us a note to Mrs. Southernly in Delhi.</p>
                <p>In Dad's last letter, he said, “I am counting the days until I see you,” so I
                    have decided now, that I will leave just as soon as I can after I am due on
                    August 28, rather than wait until October, the more comfortable month to travel,
                    to get to him as soon as I can for I realize so well he is aging.</p>
                <p>February 24, 1956, Monday</p>
                <p>Mrs. Anschutz brought Mrs. Bishop, the new Ambassador's wife, to me with a long
                    list to go over. She is having a series of teas to meet the different groups of
                    American ladies on certain days. Yesterday, I assisted her again when all of our
                    American ladies from our embassy and USIS came. Today will be JUSMAAG and next
                    week USOM and all non-government. Then will begin her regular calling days.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>She is very sweet and her two little girls were all dressed up in blue organdy
                    dresses as she held her new two-month old baby part of the time she was
                    receiving. She and the Ambassador are to be presented to the King and Queen on
                    Monday and I have been inquiring what is protocol for that occasion as the court
                    is still in mourning. I am told she must appear in a black dress, hat, gloves
                    and stockings, and courtesy.</p>
                <p>Gwen Donovan has been here so they have been entertaining them, although he is
                    actually a guest of the Thai government. Meantime, Tom Logan came to see me. He
                    is taking over Mr. Barrington's job here, who's retiring. Had dinner with him at
                    the Oriental, then took him on to a shadow play that had not been given for
                    eight years. Then he came to the Club for a drink and will be leaving for Saigon
                    and Indonesia next day.</p>
                <p>The Ledekers gave a beautiful party at their lovely place with a huge garden.
                    Enormous pink water lilies were floating in the klong with lights in them.
                    Twenty-four Thai dancers performed in their exotic costumes. Mrs. Ota looked
                    lovely in her Japanese kimono at their farewell party the other evening. When I
                    arrived I said “good evening” in Japanese and when I left, I thanked them in
                    Japanese, which brought broad grins. The Japanese lanterns and flower
                    arrangements were so reminiscent of my interesting days in Japan.</p>
                <p>Last evening I had tickets for an Italian film which the Countess Franco, wife of
                    the Italian Minister, had asked me to buy at the Japanese Ambassador's party. I
                    invited a new member of our embassy staff, Mr. Hart, to go with me as he knew
                    Italian and was very pleased to go. He took me to a Chinese dinner before and I
                    sat next to Lady MacFalgher and Lady Gage.</p>
                <p>March, 1956, at the Embassy</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>Our new Ambassador, Max Bishop, has insisted that everyone get to the office on
                    time now, so here I am on the dot of 7:30am. He will be leaving for Karachi
                    tomorrow for about a week. I may be off on that long looked forward to trip to
                    Hong Kong and Manila Monday. I have written to Mrs. Crocum in the Eileen Curshaw
                    shop at the Peninsula Hotel to alert her that I will want a camel hair coat made
                    in two days.</p>
                <p>Sunday I am going with the Siam Society on an all day trip to Ayutthaya, the old
                    capital, and then to Ban Pan Hin, the summer palace, returning by motor launch.
                    It is there those interesting little heads are found.</p>
                <p>Did you see the interesting article Frances Roosevelt wrote for the February
                    Women's Home Companion, illustrated with some of the paintings done here?</p>
                <p>I hear Dulles is coming to Bangkok.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>At the airport, March 5, 1956, 5:30am</p>
                <p>Just a line to say I am taking off in the Air Attach�'s plane for Hong Kong and
                    Manila in a few minutes and will spend two night in Hong Kong and perhaps two in
                    Manila. Due back Friday afternoon. I am writing here in a wool dress and
                    stockings and it is so hot, but expect to be more comfortable when I reach Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>At 9,000 feet on route Manila, March 7</p>
                <p>Will have this ready to post to you from Manila. Had a pleasant flight from
                    Bangkok to Hong Kong. Plane was comfortable and trip very smooth. I sat with
                    Mrs. Garland, the wife of the Air Attach�, Mrs. Anschutz and Mrs. Smith, whose
                    husband is in the political section. Others were a couple from our embassy and
                    two ladies returning to Clark Field where we will land.</p>
                <p>We arrived at Hong Kong about 2:30pm and all stayed at the International Hotel on
                    Kowloon, not far from the Peninsula, operated by Chinese. The Cumshome was in
                    port so everything was packed. I dashed immediately to Eileen Curshaw's shop to
                    see Mrs. Crocum. She had cabled me to bring 12 yards of black Thai silk for
                    men's suits, which I had under my arm. Her shop was full of old ladies off the
                    Cumshome buying things. I selected a lovely shade of half cashmere and half
                    camel hair and a tailor took measurements. I had fitting the next afternoon, but
                    didn't want to rush him by taking it with me, so hoped Dinny, or someone could
                    bring it to me.</p>
                <p>Then I got a black cashmere sweater set, Pringle, for $35. The slipover was $14
                    and cardigan was $21. And, also, a white cashmere slipover. Always thought you
                    were so smart, Mildred, to wear yours next to your skin when traveling in cold
                    countries. Looked at camphor wood chests made of teak but couldn't find any I
                    liked.</p>
                <p>When I saw Hank Sperry, he said they wanted me for dinner Tuesday, but they were
                    all booked up with Cumshome people.</p>
                <p>I got a little box for my collection from Charlotte Hortsman, who had a beautiful
                    shop near the National City Bank. A friend of a friend of mine I knew in Paris
                    is making very chic coats from the big Thai silk stoles, as is Mrs. Crocum,
                    slightly slit up the side. I took my three Cavershawn star rubies, finally
                    bought from Ainsley, to Jack Arkus, who had been highly recommended. A Russian,
                    internationally known as a designer and had been in Shanghai and Paris. He also
                    worked in platinum, which they can not do in Bangkok. He is a naturalized
                    American. He got so excited when he finally hit on a design for earrings and
                    rings of lily of the valley made of the diamonds from mother's bar pin. They
                    will be ready on April 5, a birthday present to myself.</p>
                <p>It was marvelous to be in Hong Kong again, but tantalizing to have so little
                    time. Kept thinking how lucky I was to have been given free transportation.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>Later, Manila, Clark Airbase, Friday, 7:00am, 1956</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>Will take off shortly for return to Bangkok. Florence Barrington met me here when
                    we arrived. I looked around the famous PX but didn't find too much. They were
                    selling the cotton dresses from Japan from the Dynasty shop in Hong Kong for
                    $4-5.00. I loved them so for hot countries and bought one. Then drove to Manila
                    with Florence. It has, of course, all been rebuilt since I was there. All so
                    civilized I felt I was back home again. She has an apartment with a breathtaking
                    view. Shopped a bit and had dinner at the Town Tavern. It was marvelous to be
                    able to eat lettuce, cottage cheese and grapes and drink milk. We drove out to
                    see her daughter and little grandson in Quezon City. She had a precious
                    apartment with an exquisite gold screen from Japan.</p>
                <p>I asked to see your Veteran's Hospital on the return and Mr. T. Smith showed us
                    around. I loved the orange colored walls at the entrance and balustrade made of
                    nara wood and Chinese effect of wrought iron design at the balustrades.</p>
                <p>We lunched at the Army-Navy Club and then returned to the base on the bus at
                    3:00pm. Saw Bill Phelps here, also Commander Bill McGonigal, who returned with
                    us. Florence sent me home with the most enormous delicious avocados which I
                    simply devoured.</p>
                <p>March 20, 1956</p>
                <p>The Ambassador gave me a letter he had received from Fraser Wilkoms in the State
                    Department to look after two friends of his mother's, Mrs. Roland Redman and
                    Mrs. George Nickols, no relation to Barbara Bowen's husband, George, although
                    Mrs. Redman went to school with George's sister. So, on Saturday, I went to the
                    Trocadero to meet them, but Mrs. Nickols had become ill in Honolulu and had
                    remained there. Mrs. Redman invited me to dinner that evening and said she was
                    also a friend of Frances Roosevelt, and her mother-in-law, Mrs. Theodore
                    Roosevelt, Jr. I enjoyed her so much and was told her husband was the president
                    of the board of directors for the Metropolitan Museum. She kindly invited me
                    again for lunch, yesterday, but as the Coronia was in I had to be on the lookout
                    for Mrs. L. L. Marcel, mother of Mrs. Davies, who you wrote me about. I took her
                    shopping at Jim Thompson's shop which was packed with passengers off the ship.
                    There were 500 of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>I went to dinner with Mrs. Marcel and her friend from Kansas City, Missouri, at
                    the Rat Hotel, where they all were staying. It was most amusing to see them come
                    in with their loot under their arms and some wearing those lampshade straw hats
                    the natives wear. I went with them to New Harbor to board the boat that took
                    them to their ship, the Coronia and discovered it was the Banseramsy that I had
                    taken the ten day cruise on in the Gulf of Siam. What a pleasant surprise that
                    was. I saw the Danish engineer and had a chat with him. Then a Mr. Fritchie, who
                    was also seeing friends off, and had been in Japan, came back in a taxi with
                    me.</p>
                <p>Today is the American Association luncheon, but I must write 177 invitations for
                    the Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop's party they are giving for the embassy staff and
                    local employees.</p>
                <p>Sunday, if there are 28 people to fill the plane, they are going to Angkor Wat,
                    including the sightseeing, which is very reasonable, $38 round trip. Dinny and I
                    are going. I want so much to see that seventh wonder of the world again.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Redman, whom I have been seeing a lot of, will go to Angkor Wat, too, over
                    the weekend, so we may see each other there. She has invited me to visit her in
                    Oyster Bay and said she and Frances and Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. would give
                    me a whirl. She is the most charming and interesting person I have met for a
                    very long time.</p>
                <p>I have just finished my article on protocol that I was asked to write for the
                    little magazine published here. My name appeared in the newspaper last evening
                    as having been renominated, with some others, to be on the Christ Church Vestry.
                    We are to raise funds for the repair of the organ by giving a premier of the
                    Walt Disney film, “The Lady and the Tramp,” in May. Saw excerpts of it and
                    thought it will be highly amusing.</p>
                <p>Angkor, Cambodia, March 25, 1956, Sunday</p>
                <p>Will have this ready to post when return to Bangkok this evening about 6:00pm
                    when Bill meets Dinny and me. At the last minute, they sent a guide with us, for
                    $2.50, but he certainly has not been worth it. I have gained far more from my
                    books, “Cultural in Southeast Asia.” I simply had to see these fabulous ruins
                    once again and, of course, appreciated them more this time. It is said, however,
                    to see slight changes occurring due to the departure of the French from this
                    part of the world. The neglect is beginning to set in. I hate to think what will
                    happen in a few year's time if they are not preserved. But, they said it was the
                    jungle that preserved them before, so perhaps history will repeat itself. Dinny
                    and I ate our sandwiches on route into the little village in a samlar.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>Regarding Angkor Wat. It is so true one should never go back to a place they
                    love, for it was pitiful to see the neglect since the French left. That long
                    avenue of the demons on one side and the gods on the other, you may recall
                    Mildred, that was in good condition when I was there before, found all toppled
                    over. And when I asked the guide he said it was because the Cambodians had no
                    interest in keeping it up. So, it will be such a tragedy if it gradually goes
                    back to where it was before the French did their wonderful work of
                    restoration.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon we saw Bayon and the early ones where the enormous banyan trees
                    are growing out of them. Fantastically craved temples. Saw Mrs. Redman and had a
                    brief chat with her. It has been hot and we are all pretty weary.</p>
                <p>March 28, 1956</p>
                <p>Dear Dad and Mildred,</p>
                <p>I know this will reach you too late to wish you both a happy Easter, and I am so
                    sorry, but in this Buddhist country one is not reminded of Christian holy days
                    to be foresighted enough to send you proper greetings earlier. I shall go to
                    communion as usual and Bill Phelps has invited me to have luncheon with him.
                    Then will go to the airport to meet Dinny, who returns from Hong Kong and is
                    kindly bringing my camel hair coat and jewels designed. They have invited me for
                    dinner on my birthday, April 5, and asked the Baron von Plason, which I think is
                    sweet of them.</p>
                <p>I got up at 4:00am yesterday, Tuesday, to take Mrs. Redman to the airport. She
                    left me a most fascinating book by James Michener, I had met at the Sistonovich
                    party entitled, “The Floating World,” about Japanese prints and beautifully
                    illustrated. I am thrilled to have it for I love my study of them under Mr.
                    Haper, considered a well-known authority when Charlie and I were living at the
                    Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. She also left with me a brand new bathing suit, and
                    some cotton lingerie. She is the most interesting, cultivated, charming person I
                    have known for a long time. She wants me to come to Oyster Bay when I return to
                    the United States and said the airport is really nearer to her than New
                    York.</p>
                <p>It has been awful hot and I am getting a bit weary of the heat. We at last have
                    air conditioning at the embassy and feel much better by the end of the day than
                    I did before.</p>
                <p>Last evening there was a big party of JUSMAAG people at the Club and the grounds
                    were all lit up which reminded me of my party I gave for you, Mildred. Perhaps I
                    started something.</p>
                <p>April 3, 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Bill and Dinny have invited the Rev. and Mrs. Gillmore of Christ Church with the
                    Baron von Plason to celebrate my birthday. I am so fond of those people, so it
                    should be a nice little celebration. The Baron is an ex-German diplomat and was
                    at the German embassy in Washington. He is a relation of Bismarck. I remember, I
                    think, the Chancellor's son married his mother's sister. He is a most
                    entertaining person.</p>
                <p>The padre and Mrs. Gillmore are Scottish and very nice.</p>
                <p>When Bill and I met Dinny she said the plane had been held up by bad weather on
                    route to Hong Kong in South Vietnam and stayed the night in a funny little old
                    hotel, but fortunately the weather was delightful in Hong Kong. She brought back
                    my camel hair coat and, of course, all kinds of lovely things for herself.</p>
                <p>April 5, 1956, my birthday</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>June Acough and Georgia Marlow sent me a most amusing card and I was quite
                    touched when I noted Mr. Anschutz had added his initials to it.</p>
                <p>Yes, Mildred, tell Betty Purdy I was at the SEATO maneuvers and saw all that she
                    saw on television that was so exciting. Especially the 600 parachutists jumping
                    without a casualty.</p>
                <p>Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop have been giving a series of dinner parties I have had
                    to arrange.</p>
                <p>April 25, 1956</p>
                <p>Last Thursday was a holiday and I enjoyed a rare moment sitting in my deck chair
                    in the garden, getting caught up on some back reading. When I arrived at my desk
                    the next morning, there was a note to standby. The Ambassador wished me to take
                    the American Ambassador to Ethiopia and his wife, shopping in the afternoon. He
                    was Mr. Simonson, en route on home leave and reassigned there. Mrs. Bishop
                    called me over to the residence where they were staying and I finally got a car
                    and took them to Jim Thompson's and Alex, a jeweler. Then it was time to return
                    them to the residence for luncheon. They wanted so much to see the emerald
                    Buddha but due to rehearsals in the palace grounds for the cremation on Sunday
                    of the Queen Grandmother, I had to get special permission. We went in the
                    afternoon and it was so pleasant not to have crowds roaming around and to hear
                    the tinkling of the temple bells, which was such a sweet sound. The official of
                    the royal household has kindly granted permission for me to come this Saturday
                    at 10:00am to take colored pictures, which I shall do.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>I was to go to a cocktail party Thursday evening at Colonel Hensen's, a very nice
                    Englishman who is on our Church committee and I knew I would probably meet a lot
                    of charming people. But, just as I was about to leave, I received a message from
                    the Ambassador that he and his wife wanted me to come to the residence to fill
                    in at the dinner party they were giving for the Ambassador and Mrs. Simonson as
                    the wife of General Powell couldn't come at the last minute. So, of course, it
                    was a command performance and I was obliged to go, especially as the Bishops
                    were sending a car for me at 7:45.</p>
                <p>The other guests included, General Powell, who is deputy chief of (inaudible),
                    seated to my right and Mrs. Bishop's left. Then across from me at the table was
                    our military attach�, Colonel Cowen, and His Serene Highness Prince Dilecream
                    and Prince Credecron and his wife Princess Credecron. She is the sister to the
                    ranking prince of Thailand. I had a long chat with her after dinner and she was
                    charming. Then Colonel Cowen's guest, Brigadier General Munson, who was military
                    attach� in Paris when I was there and said he remembered me. General
                    Vichitcsonngram was there. He had just given a speech at the last American
                    Association luncheon on Tuesday. And then, John Hart from our embassy. The
                    Portuguese Charg�, who was to my left at dinner, spoke of the last time we had
                    been together at dinner at the residence when Perle Mesta was here.</p>
                <p>I said, “And do you know that was the last dinner party the Peurifoys had before
                    he was killed.” And he said to me, “And do you know that they were at my house
                    for dinner the next evening, which was the last dinner party they attended
                    before he was killed.” I was deeply touched when he added, “And they were very
                    fond of you.” I cannot tell you how I miss them.</p>
                <p>The next evening a most terrible thing happened. A crazy man tried to get into
                    the embassy and the residence to see the Ambassador, but was stopped by the
                    guards. He was on the street in front of the British embassy and was finally
                    shot and killed. Some thought it had some political significance but the
                    Ambassador emphatically denied that. This man had tried this before and was
                    locked up but had escaped.</p>
                <p>The following day was the fantastic procession of the cremation of the Queen
                    Grandmother. We had tickets to sit under the tent along the route and I got some
                    photos of the place in the grounds where she was to be cremated.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>I went to 7:00 communion Sunday and Dinny picked me up at 7:30, even then we were
                    a little late getting down there, there were such crowds although it didn't
                    start for an hour later. Such a procession! It was all so glamorous and
                    fantastic. There were three bands, the Army, Navy and Air Force and, of course,
                    a rather mournful funeral dirge was played. In the distance one could hear the
                    guns booming, one every minute. As she was president of the Red Cross the nurses
                    marched in their uniforms, then school children belonging to the school that she
                    had founded for young princesses. Preceding the golden urn that held her ashes
                    was a monk sitting high in a chariot drawn by men in most colorful costumes.
                    Then came her in a most elaborate chariot, gold leaf and gold umbrella carried
                    by a colorfully dressed men and monks in white and silver dress. Some umbrella's
                    looked as if they had come out of the museum which I am sure they did. I have
                    tried to find out if there was a full description of it in English, but it does
                    not exist, only in Thai, I am told.</p>
                <p>It was very hot sitting under the tent and while I would have liked to have
                    returned at 4 to see the actual lighting of the pyre, I could not face the mob
                    and heat, and now regret that I didn't. I did accept a ride back at 10:00 in the
                    evening to see the fire.</p>
                <p>I have received an invitation from the Ambassador of India and Mrs. Mennen to
                    attend Indian dances and will go with Mr. Mascotti, from our embassy. Toi
                    Cumjara is being married May 1, to a grandson of a British peer.</p>
                <p>I am kept always very busy here in the office for Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop are
                    entertaining a lot and frequently invite me. I went to the Grand Palace Saturday
                    morning and was escorted around by an official in the royal household and got
                    the colored photos. All those colorful temples and palaces. The little
                    magazine...</p>
                <p>I came back to the embassy for the first time after a long siege of flu. I was so
                    weak for so long and it has been very prevalent lately. One Thai doctor
                    diagnosed 90 cases in a week. The doctor is giving me all kinds of medicine to
                    build me up, but the truth of the matter is, he said after one has been here 18
                    months they begin to feel the effects of the heat, the hot climate. As I have
                    been here nearly 24 months, I suppose it could be expected.</p>
                <p>So many are leaving in the next three months. Mr. Anschutz has been chosen for
                    the National War College and they depart next month. The Phelps are off in the
                    morning and Mr. and Mrs. Conover left the other day to be in Washington. They
                    have been perfect dears.</p>
                <p>At present Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop are taking a week's trip to Indonesia on
                    the Air Attach�'s plane.</p>
                <p>June 4, 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>I have been back to work now a week today and am beginning to feel stronger and
                    should for I am taking five kinds of vitamins and get B1 shots every other
                    day.</p>
                <p>June 11, 1956</p>
                <p>Some of the staff here due for home leave are not receiving their orders on time
                    and had to cancel all of their arrangements. I do hope that does not happen to
                    me. I am due August 28 and hope to leave September 3.</p>
                <p>I am having some Thai silk dresses made. Dinny was so pleased with her tailor, so
                    I am having him make a Thai silk dress to match the stole Mrs. Rose Kennedy
                    kindly gave me in a heavenly soft gray blue. Cecil is making shoes to match.</p>
                <p>I went to a cocktail party that Sir Alexander and Lady MacFalgher gave. Colonel
                    Hensen from SEATO took me to the Bamboo Bar at the Oriental for dinner
                    afterwards, with some other people. Then we went on to the Luna Club. I had not
                    been out for over a month, so thoroughly enjoyed myself.</p>
                <p>June 13, 1956</p>
                <p>There are five hundred invitations to get out for the Ambassador's Fourth of July
                    party, from 12-2:00. He is having just the top men of the diplomatic corps and
                    the foreign community. Then, the Americans are invited in the evening to a
                    reception. Then there is the American Association's picnic during the day. Thank
                    goodness they realized I did my stint last year which I appreciated. I turned
                    over all of the American Association luncheon business when I returned to the
                    office, as I am leaving.</p>
                <p>Now more work from Mrs. Bishop. She entertains so much more than Mrs.
                    Peurifoy.</p>
                <p>I am going to my Australian friend, Shirley Herd, for dinner now that she has a
                    house. Then, Wednesday, Bill McConigal is having an enormous party at the Rat
                    Hotel to welcome the new assistant Air Attach� and bid farewell to the present
                    one.</p>
                <p>Saturday is a “going native” party given by the Bakers to bid aloha to the
                    Anschutz. I shall wear my sarong from Fiji. Mrs. Moran from the American Club
                    will help me make a lei with her special needle.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Bishop is giving a big tea for Mrs. Anschutz and her successor, Mrs. George
                    F. Wilson.</p>
                <p>The next dinner the Bishops will give will be for the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    of Foreign Eastern Affairs, Mr. Sebald.</p>

                <p>June 26, 1956, at the embassy</p>
                <p>Yesterday was a Thai holiday, but I spent the entire weekend trying to finish my
                    project of going through all of my papers. Besides, it is too wet now to sit in
                    the garden in my deck chair. The rains are getting heavier, although the sun
                    shines. The lawns are looking like swamps because I suppose we are only three
                    feet above sea level.</p>
                <p>The “going native” party given at the Bakers was a perfect place for such a party
                    with an enormous sheltered patio. The entrance was covered with dry palm fronds,
                    so you feel as if you are entering Trader Vics. The moment we arrived we were
                    offered a rum punch in a bamboo container, which we sipped through a straw. Mats
                    were on the floors with cushions, a la Japanese style. Nearly everyone from the
                    embassy was there. The Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop were invited but did not come.
                    A pity, because it was such a good party. Everyone certainly looked native.
                    Georgia Marlow was priceless. She had put red lipstick on her teeth to represent
                    a beetlenut woman and when she smiled she was too funny looking for words. She
                    wore an enormous straw hat, like the women on the boats wear and a black jacket,
                    and carried on a pole, two little baskets of fruit, and, of course, was
                    barefooted.</p>
                <p>In the middle of the evening they called to the floor about six of the fattest
                    men to do the hula. Cellophane grass skirts were tied to them and some of them
                    were so fat the skirts didn't even meet around their waist. Mr. Anschutz' was
                    marvelous. The prize was a huge clump of bananas growing on the stem. When it
                    went around his neck, he looked like a prize filly that had just run a horse
                    race.</p>
                <p>A little later they asked for six girls. If Bill McGonigal didn't call out my
                    name. I said under my breath, “I will get even with you.” I had never done a
                    hula in my life, although I had lived in Honolulu eight years. Never will I
                    forget, Mildred, when you did a perfect one on a picnic on Waikiki beach and had
                    only been there two days. Well, anyway, they put a white skirt on me, Mrs.
                    Anschutz and a few others, and I just danced around the floor wiggling my hips
                    and waving my hands. The applause was amazing. When Mr. Anschutz danced with me
                    I said how pleased he must be to be appointed to the National War College. He
                    said he was but very glad to leave this place. He, as well as all of us have
                    very sad memories of the lost of our dear Ambassador Peurifoy and his young son
                    Danny in such a sudden tragic accident here.</p>
                <p>I have been assigned cabin S-19 on the sundeck on the October 9th sailing of the
                    United States from Le Havre for New York. I bought a book of the countries I am
                    planning on visiting by Julian Huxley, entitled “From An Antique Land,” which
                    has beautiful illustrations. I am longing to get to Petra, outside of Amman in
                    Jordan. Now I must get to work. The phone keeps ringing and after a long weekend
                    there is much to do and Mr. Anschutz has just come in to ask me to arrange a
                    call for Mrs. Anschutz on the wife of the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>June 28, 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>Mrs. Bishop gave an enormous tea for Mrs. Anschutz and Mrs. Wilson. Mr. Wilson is
                    our new Deputy Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>Florence Barrington wrote me that Athens was a good place to buy Persian lamb. A
                    friend bought a short jacket there for $65.</p>
                <p>I offered to do my part at the Fourth of July picnic from 11-4:00, but Mrs.
                    McGill, who is taking over the job, said I worked so hard last year, she was not
                    asking me to do anything this year. I was just as pleased and appreciative for I
                    could use the holiday to good advantage for going downtown to see about my trip
                    home. I, in any case, will have to be on hand for the reception for the
                    Americans from 6-8:00.</p>
                <p>I went to the airport with Georgia Marlow to see the Anschutzes off on Saturday
                    and, of course, there were many there including Thais. The VIP room was open for
                    them and Mrs. Anschutz had the most beautiful white orchids given her from
                    Princess Nadip wife of the Foreign Minister and gave another lei to Mr.
                    Anschutz. We were all so sorry to see them leave. I do hope to see them in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>People aren't getting their orders on time. Helen Wilson, our Personnel chief
                    said to make my plans and she would see that I would get mine on time. It is
                    difficult to get bookings from this side of the globe at the last minute. I am
                    going to book from here to Beirut, then must write some people I know in the
                    Middle East to see how conditions are there. Just before Mr. Anschutz left, he
                    went over my efficiency report with me. He said I couldn't have possibly have
                    worked any harder than I have. But it is because I have loved my job. I
                    discovered that the Ambassador in Damascus is the former inspector, William S.
                    Moose who I met in Bermuda, Tangier and Paris. So I am writing to ask about the
                    feasibility of motoring from Beirut to Jerusalem and, if possible, to go to that
                    extraordinary city of Petra. The Travells, who were on the Banseramsy going
                    through the Gulf of Siam, have invited me to dinner on Saturday. They have just
                    taken the most interesting trip from Pinang to Rangoon by ship.</p>
                <p>Packing household effects all weekend.</p>
                <p>This weekend Mrs. Bishop said the Prime Minister was expecting Vice President
                    Nixon as he is to be here only four hours and will not have time to be
                    entertained.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Davenport, whose husband is with JUSMAAG, told me at the reception yesterday
                    all about Toi Cumjara's husband. His grandfather was British married to a Thai
                    so he is about a quarter Thai. He had been married before and had a child. Now
                    Toi is pregnant.</p>

                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>Vice President Nixon's plane was late and did not arrive until midnight, so the
                    Prime Minister moved part of the dinner he had planned for him at government
                    house out to the airport. But, instead of 60 guests, there were 30. I did not go
                    out to the airport to see him.</p>
                <p>What do you think of Ambassador Sherman Cooper finally deciding to run for the
                    Senate?</p>
                <p>Friday, July 13, 1956</p>
                <p>Mrs. Bishop asked me to address 80 invitations to an exhibition of paintings by
                    well-known Chinese artists. Some of the proceeds were to go to the school for
                    the blind. They were all lovely, done as only the Chinese can do, with delicate
                    fine strokes. The Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop bought a beautiful kakemona one. To
                    do my bit I selected a set of postal cards all very good reproductions and will
                    send to Helen Keller and Polly Thompson as the proceeds are to go to the
                    blind.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Choinski, whose husband is with JUSMAAG, sent me yesterday a gift all
                    wrapped up in the prettiest bon voyage paper which is rare in this country. It
                    was the book, “Brief Interlude,” written by our first Ambassador to Thailand,
                    otherwise known as Siam, and I am simply thrilled. She is the kindest person and
                    also sent me a lovely plant when I was so ill.</p>
                <p>There is an attractive new girl I have met at the embassy, Josephine Navaro, who
                    was posted in Istanbul and as I am going there on route home, I plan to get into
                    a huddle with her soon.</p>
                <p>I went to the Bangkok warehouse to check the box with my trap in it. I just stuck
                    my hand through the box to be sure it was still there and caress the side of it.
                    And what a thrill it was bringing back my drives in the Bois for four years when
                    posted in Paris. I do hope I will have an opportunity of using it again before
                    very long.</p>
                <p>July 17, 1956</p>
                <p>Dr. and Mrs. Spinks have just received their orders for home leave and will also
                    be posted in Washington.</p>
                <p>Yesterday was a meeting of the Church Council and I verbally announced my
                    resignation as the next meeting will be September 10 when I will probably be
                    gone. All expressed regret at my departure. It has been an interesting
                    experience for me. I have Bill Phelps to thank for that.</p>
                <p>My room now is quite dismantled. I have been invited to the Spanish Minister's
                    reception tomorrow evening at the Rat Hotel on the occasion of the Spanish
                    National Day.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>I received the sweetest letter from Baris in Paris. She is thrilled I am coming
                    through there and is writing Fifi, the Princess of Hesse. She said they had a
                    falling out after 20 years of friendship and thought my visit would bring them
                    together again. I do hope so.</p>
                <p>July 30, 1956</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>Well, the big news that I received today is that my travel orders arrived by
                    telegram—Loose pack effects. So that means I shall be assigned my next post when
                    I reach Washington. I am going to June Acough's for dinner and she will go with
                    me after to the Siam Society to see the film on the cremation of the Queen
                    Grandmother, which should be interesting.</p>
                <p>Yesterday morning I went with the Siam Society to visit a famous Chinese temple.
                    Inside were those lamps like you brought back from Bangkok, burning big fat
                    candles in them.</p>
                <p>Sunday evening I was invited to the Kolwinskis for buffet dinner to celebrate
                    their 27th wedding anniversary. Both of them are perfect dears.</p>
                <p>August 6, 1956</p>
                <p>Dr. and Mrs. Spinks, who have been the most interesting and charming people in
                    our Service here were all booked to sail for the United States when suddenly Dr.
                    Spinks received an assignment to Java. When I saw them just now, they were
                    undecided what they would do. That is life in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>August 8, 1956</p>
                <p>I do hope the trouble in Egypt will not prevent me from continuing with all of my
                    plans, for I want so much to see that part of the world.</p>
                <p>August 10, 1956</p>
                <p>A charming letter came from Helen Keller's secretary thanking me for the postals
                    of the Chinese paintings and said they would be delighted to see me when I came
                    in the Fall.</p>
                <p>August 14, 1956</p>
                <p>Time is flying. I keep packing and packing and never seem to get to the end. If
                    necessary to give up Egypt will plan to go to Athens earlier and spend that time
                    taking some little steamer trips in the Aegean. I feel I should cancel that
                    portion of the itinerary, but will wait for the result of the meeting which
                    takes place in London tomorrow. Both sides sound very drastic.</p>

                <p>August 16, 1956, Embassy, 6:30pm</p>
                <p>Mildred,</p>
                <p>Just a line for the present. I am still at the office having just finished
                    writing 50 invitations for Mrs. Bishop's cocktail party in honor of Mark Evans,
                    TV celebrity, and his party arriving tomorrow. The deluge has started now.</p>
                <p>Have definitely decided to take the five day cruise in the Aegean on the MS
                    Sumarion, which goes to all the little islands. Someone said it would be more
                    pleasant, especially at this time of the year as it would be very hot in Egypt
                    now, and hot in more ways than one.</p>
                <p>August 20, 1956</p>
                <p>The Spanish Minister called me this morning and wishes to give a dinner party for
                    me. The date has been set for next Monday, August 26, at 8:00pm and asked what
                    friends I would like him to invite. I mentioned, the Naval Attach�, Bill
                    McGonigal and Colonel and Mrs. Cowen, our Army Attach� and wife, who also are
                    leaving soon. The Ambassador and Mrs. Bishop and Baron von Plason, who is an old
                    friend of his, as is Bill McGonigal.</p>
                <p>Bill asked me to give him the names of 20 people for a party on his boat about
                    6:30 before the sun sets, if there is a sun. There has been so much rain lately.
                    But, hope the fates will be kind that evening.</p>
                <p>Then Mr. and Mrs. Sistonovich, Deputy Chief of USIS, are giving a dinner for me
                    this Saturday.So, I am getting rather booked up.</p>
                <p>When I saw Jim Thompson was having a 3-day sale on remnants, I got up early on
                    Saturday and was there from 9-12:30 going over all the colors and finally
                    selected some Siamese pink, purple, blue and cerise in as large remnants as I
                    could find for you Mildred.</p>
                <p>Received a letter from Mr. Moore, Ambassador in Damascus today, saying no reason
                    not to carry out my plans to visit the Middle East and hoped I would stop in the
                    embassy while I'm there and would be pleased to see me.</p>
                <p>August 24, 1956</p>
                <p>I received an invitation to our Ambassador's dinner, August 31 they are giving in
                    honor of Ambassador Rankin.</p>
                <p>August 29, 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>I am thrilled that you are going to be in New York on my arrival and do hope we
                    can get tickets for “My Fair Lady.” Mrs. Heath, wife of the Ambassador in
                    Beirut, wrote my visas would be ready for me on my arrival and hope to see me.
                    They remember Charlie who had been posted in Saigon.</p>
                <p>I am so glad Martha Spinks called you.</p>
                <p>The dinner at the Spanish Minister's was delightful. Baron von Plason said he
                    would come to the airport to see me off.</p>
                <p>September 3, 1956, Monday, 4:45pm at the airport, Bangkok</p>
                <p>Just a line before I take off at 5:30pm. The plane was to take off at 4:30 but
                    was delayed. For this reason Baron von Plason, who had come to say goodbye, had
                    to go back to Bangkok, but left a beautiful bouquet of orchids. The Spanish
                    Minister is here and brought me two gorgeous orchids I am wearing now. Received
                    at the Club just before I left official recognition of appreciation for my ten
                    years of Service from the Department of State. What a nice sendoff.</p>
                <p>Hotel St. George, Beirut, September 6, 1956</p>
                <p>While waiting for my breakfast, will write to you. This is a beautiful place, so
                    like Tangier. I finally took off from Bangkok at 6:00pm. Fernando, the Spanish
                    Minister, the Wells and their four children, waved me goodbye.</p>
                <p>I wrote you at the airport that Baron von Plason had come and left me a beautiful
                    bouquet of orchids with a note and a dear little good luck piece that looks like
                    a seal from Mrs. Durem, the delightful wife of the German Charg�.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>I had a berth on the plane and it was really good to stretch out for I was
                    exhausted. Arrive here about 7:00am and delighted to find an invitation to
                    dinner from Ambassador and Mrs. Heath last evening at 8:30pm. Mrs. Heath had
                    sent me a car to take me to the consulate for my visas. Then I went to the
                    National City Bank to see about my various currencies. A Mike Arnold there and a
                    Mr. Simons, regional manager, remembered Charlie. Then to Nawa's tourist agency
                    who is sending a car to drive me back via Galbek. I was so exhausted my first
                    evening when I arrived at 6:00, flung myself on the bed and what a nice soft
                    one, and didn't awaken until 8:00pm. I didn't feel like dressing to go down to
                    dinner so just ordered up some of those marvelous white grapes and then went to
                    bed. I was up at 5:20 this morning and got myself organized and off at 8:00 to
                    see the town museum and university and to Biblos where I met a very nice
                    American, Mrs. Alan Johnson, whose father, Mr. Johnson, was in Congress and knew
                    father Trimble. We had a delicious lunch together at a restaurant called Doyen.
                    It was good to hear and speak a little French again.</p>
                <p>Rested, then donned Betty Purdy's pretty dress and was off to the Ambassador's
                    dinner wearing the orchids Baron von Plason had so kindly brought to me at the
                    airport, which were still fresh. I gave the Heaths a little muddler of Siamese
                    bronze ware. There were 30 guests in honor of the Mexican Minister and his wife.
                    Of course, found mutual friends in chatting with many guests. I was placed to
                    the left of Mr. Emerson, who was deputy chief of mission and friends of the
                    Spinks and knew Sir Alexander and Lady MacFalgher in Pakistan. Also discovered
                    that Mr. Simons, of the National City Bank is married to Mona Gardner Tate who I
                    knew in Japan and who is now a well-known writer. The residence was filled with
                    interesting collections from Indo-China where Mr. Heath was Ambassador. We dined
                    at small tables on the terrace and it was most delightful.</p>
                <p>The weather is pleasant and I am feeling more rested now. Breakfast has just
                    arrived and I am having fresh figs with Devonshire cream and those delicious
                    grapes that I have not had for years.</p>
                <p>September 8, 1956</p>
                <p>I am waiting at the airport to take off for Jerusalem at 2:30pm. I love this area
                    around the Mediterranean and feel so well and happy. In that car from Beirut to
                    Damascus was a Mrs. Chase and her daughter. Pleasant Americans with a company in
                    Dhahran, Arabia. She knew this country well. The daughter was going to Damascus
                    to buy some of that beautiful brocade for her wedding gown. I immediately went
                    to see Mr. Moose, our Ambassador, who said I should try and see Palmyra.</p>
                <p>September 11, 1956</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>Back in Beirut awaiting my plane to Istanbul. Just discovered it also goes to
                    Cyprus and am pleased I will see it from the air.</p>
                <p>How I love the Holy Land. The American Colony Hotel, where I stayed was small
                    with great charm. Mrs. Bertha Spatford, the American manager had lived there
                    about 70 years and I read the book, “Our Jerusalem” she wrote and now out of
                    print. Her daughter, Mrs. Lynn, who will soon come to the United States when she
                    knows how the Egyptian case is going, is beautiful and has been so nice to me. I
                    had an excellent guide, Gabrielle, and it seemed unbelievable that I was
                    standing on the very ground that I had read about in the Bible and studied in
                    Sunday School..</p>
                <p>Jerusalem seemed so peaceful except for the sight of barbed wire and some armed
                    guards here and there. So, I saw all the points of interest including a trip to
                    the Dead Sea. The people are all complaining though that there are so few
                    tourists now. They said I could have gone to Egypt but then I might have been on
                    pins and needles. I sent a passion flower from the Garden of Gethsemane and a
                    little note to Dad.</p>
                <p>Istanbul, Hilton, September 14, 1956</p>
                <p>Mildred,</p>
                <p>I am waiting in the BEA office for the bus to take me to the airport for my plane
                    to Athens. We had a brief stop in Cyprus where the airport was surrounded by
                    armed British guards. They said that all of their leaves had been canceled, but
                    smiled and added, “It is only to bluff Egypt.”</p>
                <p>We flew to Ankara, which I had not expected. No one on the plane spoke English so
                    I didn't know we were to change planes there for Istanbul until my luggage was
                    found in customs and was told, “No customs in Istanbul.” So, didn't take off
                    until quite late.</p>
                <p>When arrived at the Hilton at 11:30pm discovered to my dismay they had given up
                    my room so they put me in one of the cabana's by the swimming pool for the
                    night. Next morning it was pouring and I couldn't even get out to the toilet
                    which was on the other side of the pool and my umbrella was packed in my luggage
                    left in the hotel. But, I was given the next day a room overlooking the
                    Bosporus.</p>
                <p>I received a call from your friend, Mookie, saying they would come to take me out
                    at 3:30pm, so in the morning I took a motor coach tour to the Blue Mosque and
                    St. Sophia, etc. Had luncheon on the terrace of the Hilton. Mookie, her daughter
                    and brother, took me for a delightful drive along the Bosporus and tea later.
                    Then came back to take me to a Turkish restaurant for dinner, but it was closed
                    so had a lobster dinner on the terrace of the Hilton, which first tasted so good
                    but it was windy and chilling and suddenly found I had lost my appetite.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>That night in my room, lost all I had eaten, including all the toasts we had
                    drunk.</p>
                <p>I called Betty Carp at the consulate, who a girl in Bangkok had asked me to look
                    up. A doctor came from the American Hospital and gave me belladonna to stop the
                    nausea and some salts. So, all of yesterday I was in bed. It was cold and rainy
                    so thought not too pleasant to take the ferry trip. Mookie and daughter came to
                    see me yesterday afternoon and I am much better now. Will write more when I
                    reach Athens.</p>
                <p>Hotel Grand Bretagne, Athens. Greece, September 17, 1956</p>
                <p>Here I have met Olga Humona, the excellent guide to visit the Museum of
                    Archeology and the Parthenon, etc. Yesterday, took an all day motor trip to
                    Corinth and last evening heard Orpheus and Euripides in the ruins of an old
                    Roman theater below the Parthenon. What a thrill to sit in that 2,000 year old
                    theater with the moon shining on it and the Parthenon and Temple of Nikki lit up
                    in all their Grecian splendor. I adore Athens and the people here seem so
                    alert.</p>
                <p>This evening I leave for my cruise in the Aegean. Will stop at Crete and Rhodes,
                    etc. The weather is nippy and there is a tinge of Fall in the air. I have donned
                    stockings for the first time after two years.</p>
                <p>Hotel Grand Bretagne, Athens, Greece, September 23, 1956</p>
                <p>My cruise was delightful. About 135 on it and such a m�lange of languages. My
                    French has been useful. We stopped first at Crete. Here the earliest Greek
                    civilization stands. Then to Rhodes which would be a beautiful place to spend a
                    holiday as well as being of historical interest, in this good hotel, DeRhodes,
                    on a lovely beach where we lunched. The next islands were Kos and Patmos. Patmos
                    was charming with little white houses high on a hill surrounding a monastery. It
                    was here in a grotto that St. John was banished by the Romans and wrote the
                    “Apocalypse.” Then we sailed on to Delos which has been excavated by the French
                    mostly and only ruins here. Then to Mikonos where all this interesting material
                    is woven. Picked up some scarves here, cheaper than Athens. It was an adorable
                    place with pretty little streets and gleaming white houses. A haven for
                    artists.</p>
                <p>On the ship was a couple from our embassy in Bangkok, Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe, with
                    whom I had luncheon the other day and found several mutual friends in the
                    Foreign Service. Mr. Metcalfe had taken over Norbert Anschutz' job, when he
                    left.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>I came back from the cruise bronze and rested and Mrs. Humona saw such a
                    difference in my appearance that she thought I had fallen in love. But, I said
                    quite the contrary for I only wished for someone to pal around with, for
                    everyone seemed to have someone. But, I did fall in love with the islands. Mrs.
                    Humona took me to visit the Agora, where the Americans had done so much and to
                    the Benaki museum and thought of you and could well understand how you loved it.
                    Each tiny object selected with such exquisite taste. Now I am off to Paris where
                    I shall be for ten days.</p>
                <p>I dashed out at 11:00 this morning to see the changing of the guard in front of
                    the palace. So interesting with music and all. I love the way these white
                    accordion pleated skirts swished back and forth just below the bottoms of the
                    Greek soldiers when they march. In fact, I have found Greece vastly interesting
                    and glad for the time aboard ship so I can read up on all I have seen.</p>
                <p>Hotel Vouillamont, Paris, September 27, 1956</p>
                <p>How glad I am to be where I am. I can stretch out for a few days. I got some
                    beautiful silk and cotton material in Jerusalem made in Dimashq [Damascus] in 5
                    yard lengths. It is a glazed cotton stripe material used for the men's
                    djellabas.</p>
                <p>The flight from Athens to Paris was very pleasant. I sat next to Lumas Dean,
                    photographer on staff of Life magazine returning from Cairo where he said
                    nothing much was happening, but told of his experiences photographing the Arroyo
                    Dorio. He was on the Ile de France going to Europe when they went back to pick
                    up the survivors. He got off the ship to photograph and left all of his clothes
                    and had to go to Macy's to replenish his wardrobe before he could fly to Europe
                    to join his family. He said the Italian crew were the first off the ship.</p>
                <p>Baris and Dimetri were the first to meet me when we arrived in Paris, Sunday,
                    about 8:30pm. Dear Baris was bearing a bouquet of red roses for me which I
                    thought so sweet. They took me to my hotel, the Vouillamont where I had lived
                    for four years when posted there and invited me for lunch the next day.</p>
                <p>...curtseyed to me in such a gracious little way, then threw her arms around me
                    and hugged me so tight I could have wept. I was so touched. Fifi, Princess of
                    Hesse, is back from Cannes and I hope to see her soon.</p>
                <p>Yvonne Sonlegee, had a beautiful bouquet of dahlias in my room when I arrived
                    with a sweet note inviting me to dine with her Monday evening, and when I
                    arrived there, who should appear but Andre Triolet, so we all had much to talk
                    about. He looked wonderfully well and had come on the 20th when he thought I was
                    due. He said my pony is in Alsace and Gager has left Paris to be a trainer
                    somewhere in France. I hope to see dear old Albert, my groom one day.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>I had luncheon with Florence Davidson and she had staying with her a Mrs. Lucille
                    Swan, who has been everywhere. She stayed with Ambassador and Mrs. Stanton in
                    Bangkok and knew my friend Baron von Plason, etc.</p>
                <p>It rained all yesterday and I am already feeling the cold, so trying to take care
                    of myself. Yvonne went with me to get a hat, I don't possess one. I am lunching
                    with her tomorrow and she is taking me to a collection of John Patue where I
                    hope to see the Odette.</p>
                <p>M. (Inaudible) is no longer at (Inaudible), but have found most of the personnel
                    the same, wherever I have gone. It is so nice to have all the French girls at
                    Grandes where I had my hair done come up and speak to me. It was like coming
                    home to have the same people come out and get my luggage when I arrived at the
                    Vouillamont. The first thing that M. Dumas, the concierge, asked me was, “How is
                    your sister?” Many, of course, have.</p>
                <p>I was delighted to have been given my old room, 217 and to have dear Mary Louise,
                    the same chambermaid, but had forgotten how really shabby this old hotel is, but
                    still retaining its charm about it. The personnel is always so kind.</p>
                <p>I rang the Duchess d'Richelieu yesterday and the maid said she was out of town
                    but expected back today, so hope to see her.</p>
                <p>Robert Javel, my French friend, is taking me to dinner Tuesday evening. Nicole
                    (Inaudible) came to see me Tuesday and I will go there in a few days.</p>
                <p>Everyone looks just the same and they say I haven't changed, in fact, look
                    younger, which, of course, warms my heart.</p>
                <p>Paris, October 1, 1956</p>
                <p>It is bright and sunny now although it poured with rain when I came out this
                    morning. So happy to be back in Paris, which seems like home. I have just
                    finished lunch at Vebers, where one of the maitre d's came up and said, “Why, I
                    haven't seen you for ages,” which pleased me having been missed there.</p>
                <p>I have spoken on the phone with the Countess d'Albaes, my Japanese/French friend.
                    As I passed the Continental Hotel I thought I would inquire if Mrs. Essen would
                    happen to be there, and there she was, but in bed. So, I went up to her room for
                    a chat and she told me all about the Grace Kelly/Prince Rainier wedding in Monte
                    Carlo, where she lives.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>On Friday, I lunched with Yvonne and she took me to a collection of John Pat___.
                    Everything was quite wearable and feminine. To wear those new hats well, though,
                    one should do their hair like you did when in high school, off ears, like mother
                    did, too. When hats were not worn, ostrich feathers were stuck on with a
                    brilliant pin. Hope to go to see Christian Dior and Balman collection before I
                    leave.</p>
                <p>Friday evening had dinner with the Duchess d'Richelieu who was just back from
                    Bruges with Frances Clarity, her companion. She said my friend, Baron von Plason
                    was really fond of her deceased sister, Julie, whom you will remember, Mildred,
                    invited us to lunch when we were in New York. The Duchess was most interested in
                    news of him. And Frances tells me I am sailing home with the Windsors.</p>
                <p>Dined with Baris and Dimetri Conderov last evening. Had tea with Nicole and
                    tonight dinner with Robert Javel. Tomorrow I am going for the day to Jacqueline
                    Cramer's who bought an 18th century house near Chartres. Miss Freeman, the dear
                    little French woman who did my mending, left a bouquet of flowers for me at the
                    hotel and I hope to see her.</p>
                <p>Hotel Vouillamont, October 1, 1956</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>I long for you today as I wrote you Jacqueline Cramer, a Swiss friend from
                    Tangier days invited me down to her precious place in the country. She met me at
                    Chartres at 10:00am and we took a look at the beautiful cathedral, I have, of
                    course, seen several times. But, I am always enthralled by it. Then drove to her
                    adorable house tucked away quite by itself. Part of it is 11th century, so it
                    reeks with antiquity and tradition. Some of the stones were the ones that had
                    gone into the cathedral of Chartres. It is surrounded by a little moat and the
                    house is covered with old ivy. The garden has charming little nooks here and
                    there where some old urns have been dug up, giving it a look of ruins I have
                    seen in some of the Grecian islands. There may be hidden treasures there. She
                    had staying with her a delightful friend from Brazil who knew my friend,
                    Madeline Bounet Culaso, who lives there and I knew in Tangier. We lunched on
                    white wrought iron tables on the terrace in the sun. It was a heavenly day. Her
                    darling house is filled with exquisite antiques you would love. She sent me home
                    with some white cosmos and two frames made of seashells.</p>
                <p>Washington, D.C., November 15, 1956</p>
                <p>Mildred my dear,</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>I just want to say again how awfully grateful I am for everything you have been
                    so very sweet to do for me while I have been here. You have no idea what it
                    means to have a home like this to come home to and I dread to leave it. So,
                    write again. God bless you dear and keep you for my return.</p>
                <p>Pasadena, California, November 23, 1956</p>
                <p>It was so good to hear your voice Thanksgiving and I hope you had a pleasant day.
                    I can't feel like being away longer than necessary from Dad, for I feel every
                    moment with him is precious. The clippings you sent regarding the Travells, who
                    had been with me on the Banseramsy in the Gulf of Siam, being killed somewhere
                    on a cruise was an awful shock.</p>
                <p>Pasadena, November 27, 1956</p>
                <p>Dad looks well. I am so happy to be with him in the wonderful climate. It is
                    heavenly to sit out in the swing or take brief walks in the glorious sunshine
                    without coats on.</p>
                <p>December 10, 1956, 7:00am</p>
                <p>By the time you read this I will be on the sea and thinking of you all. Of the
                    wonderful things you have done for me and missing you very much. You looked so
                    pretty as you always do, waving to me from the dock.</p>
                <p>Aboard the Independence, December 10, 1956</p>
                <p>I do hope you are not completely exhausted from all the parties, shopping, etc.
                    and are now taking a good rest. I have been trying to do the same, but the ship
                    has been rolling for days. Luckily not the type of motion to give you mal de
                    mare, but gets awfully monotonous. I have met a Foreign Service couple and their
                    daughter with deck chairs next to mine. They are going to Ethiopia where Mr.
                    Balance will be administrative officer at our embassy. I mentioned I met his
                    ambassador, Mr. Simonson in Bangkok, but he had not yet met him.</p>
                <p>I have also met Camille Shadic going to our embassy in Rome, and the Jones family
                    going to Belgrade. But the person I have been with most is a Finnish/Swedish
                    woman, Lisa Valesca, who is a naturalized American. She is perfectly beautiful
                    and utterly charming. She has been in films and on television and was Miss
                    Finland in 1930. We have had many long chats together and she told me she had
                    once been proposed to by the now deceased Maharajah of Jodhpur. We plan to take
                    the all-day excursion together when we reach Lisbon and go by car to Sintra,
                    then to Monterat and out to Estoril. She disembarks at Algeciras and plans to
                    stay in Madrid.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>I am so pleased a tour is going to Taormina when we are at Messina. I shall try
                    and present the note of introduction David Ayers gave me to his friend, Culver
                    Sherrill, who lives there. It will be nice to have already seen this much of
                    Sicily.</p>
                <p>The fine lectures, Dr. Minard Owens Williams, has given with colored slides, have
                    been most interesting. He is now employed by Export Lines. They pulled him out
                    of retirement from the Bosporus where he said he was getting too cold.</p>
                <p>The food on the ship cannot compare with that of the United States, but the
                    attitude of the personnel is more courteous. I have not participated in the
                    evening activities because have concentrated in getting off my Christmas
                    cards.</p>
                <p>Tonight is Captain's Dinner and Miss Valesca has been invited to sit at the
                    Captain's table and the poem she wrote some time ago will be read.</p>
                <p>Later.</p>
                <p>At the Captain's Dinner tonight a padre sang songs from “My Fair Lady,”— “I Could
                    Have Danced All Night,” “In the Streets Where You Are.” You may know how I must
                    have felt. I can only relive again the fun and pleasure it was to have seen it
                    with you, and twice.</p>
                <p>Aboard Independence, December 20, 1956</p>
                <p>We are steaming towards Algeciras. It is less rolling now and the sun is out. I
                    sent a cable to Bill Donahide to please send you a poinsettia plant, I wanted
                    you to have it for Christmas, but thought it would please you to have it arrive
                    on the 22nd, your wedding anniversary.</p>
                <p>I am enclosing a little jasmine flower in this letter from the Montserrat garden
                    I visited on a tour yesterday. We were due at 8, but due to fog and lack of
                    space to berth, we were four hours late. Miss Valesca and I occupied a car with
                    another couple and an American Express guide and drove first to see the royal
                    palace at Quelec in the fog. It was truly a miniature Versailles where they were
                    preparing for a visit by Queen Elizabeth in February. It was in the kitchen of
                    the palace where the restaurant was that David Ayers wanted me to have luncheon
                    and only wish we could have for it looked charming. But being on a tour was
                    obliged to go with the others to the Central Hotel in Sintra where I bought in a
                    shop under the hotel a big Majorca plate for your cocktail stuffed eggs.</p>
                <p>After we left Quelec we drove to the Pina Palace, high on a hill of Moorish
                    architecture, reconstruction of a medieval castle. It was so interesting and
                    with a lovely view. By that time the fog had cleared and the sun came out, we
                    had a glorious sunny day, then the day was just nippy. It turned into a charming
                    place with beautiful trees and homes, so much more attractive than Estoril,
                    where we went later.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>We drove on but we didn't see anything of the city of Lisbon. I didn't mind but
                    some did. I didn't mind, all cities are alike to me. I much preferred the
                    country and historical castles.</p>
                <p>I served your Scotch before the Captain's Dinner, to the Balances and invited
                    Miss Valesca, but she drinks only tomato or orange juice, probably why she keeps
                    so beautiful. In turn the Balances asked me to join them for a liquor in the
                    lounge after dinner where we heard the reading of Miss Valesca's poem by a young
                    actor.</p>
                <p>I received a nice letter from the Consul in Palermo, Mr. John Auchincloss, saying
                    that I would be met and assisted through customs when I disembarked at Naples.
                    So my mind is at rest on that score.</p>
                <p>No more news. On Christmas Day I will be cherishing the memory of the beautiful
                    Christmas which prevailed in your apartment when you had the exquisite wreath
                    and tiny tree with Merry Christmas on my dressing table and all of the other gay
                    decorations in your apartment. I hope you really know how much everything has
                    meant to me.</p>
                <p>Aboard Independence, December 21, 1956, 11:25pm</p>
                <p>We are due at Messina at 1:00pm tomorrow. I have shared your Scotch with a Mrs.
                    Lola Walker, who is returning to Rome and has been with the embassy for seven
                    years. She has invited me to stay with her if I came to Rome.</p>
                <p>I finished that book, “Roman Candle,” by Tish Baldridge. You must try to read it,
                    it is so amusing.</p>
                <p>It has been delightful today ever since we left Gib and entered the Mediterranean
                    it has stopped rolling. Had luncheon on deck beside the pool. One brave man
                    actually went into the pool for a swim. I told Dr. Biera, the Portuguese Charg�
                    I knew in Bangkok, how much I enjoyed his country.</p>
                <p>December 22, 1956</p>
                <p>The hairdresser has just set my hair with beer. She said it was better for the
                    sea air and I must not miss seeing Stromboli we see about midnight after leaving
                    Messina.</p>
                <p>December 22, 1956, 9:05am</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>A message came from Max Hall, my friend who was transferred from Bangkok to
                    Naples and happened to be duty officer at the consulate today, inviting me to
                    dinner and to stay until I leave tonight for Palermo.</p>
                <p>I took a motor tour of Messina and Taormina, a divine place. Telephoned Culver
                    Sherrill, the friend of David Ayers to whom he gave me a note of introduction,
                    and he said he was having a cocktail party at 7:00 and invited me over. It was
                    just a five minute walk from the Hotel Dominico where we were to have dinner. So
                    I skipped dinner and walked over. He has a perfectly beautiful house with a
                    swimming pool and terraces on different levels, two butlers in red jackets and
                    two boxer dogs. A Sicilian chap, Johnny Pe, was there from the Palermo consulate
                    and I met several attractive people. I was impressed by Culver, who was the most
                    charming host.</p>
                <p>I returned to the Dominico at 8:00 and rejoined our group going back to the
                    Independence and sailed at 10:00pm.</p>
                <p>Aboard Calabria , December 23, 8:45pm</p>
                <p>I am now bound for Palermo aboard the Calabria. At Naples I was taken to the
                    consulate where Max Hall, his mother and wife, Priscilla, were waiting for me.
                    It was so good to see them again and met his new wife. We chatted a bit and then
                    Mrs. Hall, Priscilla and I went to church.</p>
                <p>I was introduced to the British Consul and his wife, who knew very well the
                    British Ambassador, Sir Barclay Gage in Bangkok. In fact, he had recently stayed
                    with them. I thought the padre looked familiar and discovered he had been at the
                    British embassy church in Paris and I had attended several of his services when
                    I was a regular parishioner there in 1952-54. His name was Mr. Johnson.</p>
                <p>Max met us at church, drove us around a little. There was not much sun and it was
                    misty so could not see Vesuvius or Capri and Naples now is very much like Hong
                    Kong. Then to their apartment which looked gay with its Christmas decorations.
                    We went to luncheon at a very attractive restaurant across the street. Then back
                    to their apartment and sat around the fire and talked. I was requested to bring
                    two turkeys over to Jean Smith and the steward of the Independence sent them to
                    my ship and are now in the frig. Mrs. Hall gave me some Nescafe and
                    chocolate.</p>
                <p>I boarded my ship, the Calabria, about an hour ago and have been watching the
                    Independence, that by curious coincidence has been berthed next to the Calabria,
                    sail all aglow with all her lights on. Now I can visualize how it must have
                    looked to you when I sailed on her and I live that day all over again. The snap
                    of the _________________________ was like the heart string was snapping. We are
                    due to arrive at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
                <p>Palermo, December 1956-December 1958</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Christmas Day.</p>
                <p>Several Italian battleships are lighted up in the harbor. Tomorrow will be
                    Christmas Eve and I shall be in Palermo, my next post for two years.</p>
                <p>(Inaudible), who had come over for the holidays. Mr. Auchincloss took me to my
                    hotel, the Lincoln Hyacthin Metropole and before leaving very kindly asked if I
                    would like to come to dinner tonight or luncheon tomorrow. Remembering it would
                    be Christmas Eve and a family occasion, I thought it would be more polite to
                    accept for luncheon. I had hoped I could have stayed with my own family for
                    Christmas and felt a bit embarrassed to arrive just at this particular time, but
                    my leave was up and my area officer said that if I didn't depart they would give
                    the job to someone else, so naturally I had to go.</p>
                <p>Eddie Pole I had known when we both were posted in Paris, came to the hotel
                    shortly after saying he had received a letter from George Palmer about me. We
                    walked over to the consulate where he showed me around and said I was to be in
                    the visa section. Then he introduced me to the Consul General, Mr. Keeley, who
                    invited me to a reception they were having the 27th.</p>
                <p>A car and chauffeur called for me at 1:00 and we drove to the Auchincloss
                    apartment down a lovely magnolia lined avenue appropriately named Via Magnolia
                    where John and Audrey were just getting settled. They thought I might like an
                    apartment that was for rent on the top floor of their building, but, of course,
                    I didn't know the rent. They were a delightful couple and so kind.</p>
                <p>When I was relaxing in my room after luncheon, the porter knocked on my door
                    bearing the most enormous bouquet of long stemmed red poinsettias and a festive
                    Christmas basket tied with a red ribbon and filled with candies, stuffed dates
                    and tangerines with a card saying, “From Consul General and Mrs. Keeley to bring
                    you a little cheer on your first Sicilian Christmas.” I was deeply touched and
                    telephoned to thank them at once and also sent a note. It helped so much to get
                    through Christmas Eve which I celebrated alone, but glad to retire early for the
                    next day I knew I would be with friends.</p>
                <p>My first letter home was written Christmas Day, 1956</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>I have just come from the most beautiful Christmas service and the most beautiful
                    Anglican church I have ever been in. So beautiful that I brushed a few tears
                    from my cheeks but I am trying not to feel too sorry for myself being away from
                    you this Christmas. The Auchinclosses have taken me to church, also being
                    Episcopalians, where Mr. Auchincloss read one of the lessons. Mr. Barley, the
                    British Consul, apparently always read the first lesson. He introduced me to
                    Mrs. Keeley who sat just behind us and, of course, the padre, the Rev. Hazelton
                    and the British Consul and Mrs. Barley. I stayed on for communion and then
                    walked across the street to the hotel opposite to look at rooms and inquire
                    rates. It is a nice hotel and nearer my visa office which is in a different
                    building from the main consulate.</p>
                <p>I learned the Anglican church with its exquisite gold mosaics had been the chapel
                    to the palace across the street which is now the Palma Hotel and belonged to the
                    English Whittacker family. Joseph Whittacker built the Church of the Holy Cross
                    in 1872-75 on land given by Benjamin Ingham, Jr., an uncle who called out the
                    Whittacker family in 1816. He was formerly a cloth merchant from Leeds and later
                    made his fortunate in Marsala wine, furnishing it to the British fleet during
                    the days of Lord Nelson. Marsala was named for the Arabic port, Mars-el-Allah,
                    harbor of god.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, I was invited for eggnogs at the Poles. She was Joy Little when
                    I knew her at the embassy in Paris. Then later, for Christmas dinner at Jean
                    Smith's for whom I had brought the two turkeys. There I met some interesting
                    people. An Englishman, Ralph Blum, studying anthropology, and David Begley, from
                    the British consulate, soon be transferred to Hanoi, near Saigon, so he is not
                    too pleased about it. But I remembered dancing with the Frenchman who said,
                    “Hanoi, why it is adorable.”</p>
                <p>The weather is not very pleasant, misty and grey and the sun appears only
                    intermittently. But the warmth of welcome I have received makes up for it.</p>
                <p>On New Year's Day, Heather Ridwood gave a cocktail party for her mother, Doris
                    Allen, who was chief of the citizen section at the embassy in Rome and had
                    married a Foreign Service officer posted in Istanbul. I again met several
                    interesting people. Just as I was leaving, Al Griegus, the director of USIS,
                    asked if I would like to go to the Palma Hotel and see the inauguration of the
                    link up of television with Italy. The president of Italy was to give a speech
                    and it was considered a big event. After that, Italy became mad over television.
                    Then he said he was invited to a New Year's Eve party being given by the
                    McKeevers at their place in Mandello and invited me to join him. Mandello was a
                    favorite seaside resort where many people had homes.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>The consulate had been closed until December 27th when I reported for duty in the
                    visa section where I was put in charge of the classified files and helped with
                    the numerous correspondence from congressmen regarding visa cases. My colleague
                    was Ellis Debolto, an energetic �migr� from the old aristocracy of Estonia and
                    was very helpful to me. Robert Slutz was our superior officer.</p>
                <p>I began my first Italian lesson which I continued to have every morning from
                    11-12:00 with an excellent teacher.</p>
                <p>It was the evening that Consul and Mrs. Katy gave a reception for the staff and
                    Ellis and her husband, Alexander Bolto Van Hoehnbach, also from the Balkans and
                    had studied for the diplomatic service, invited me to go with them. They also
                    took me to the cocktail party the Slutzes gave in their home in Mandello and a
                    dance that the consulate gave at the Jolly Hotel.</p>
                <p>As we did not work on Saturday, I decided to find my way around the town and took
                    a bus trip with several others. Our first stop was at a picturesque, unused
                    church called St. John the Hermit, hidden away among the lush tropical foliage
                    and flowers built by Roger II in 1132. Above the ragged leaves of the banana
                    trees rose pink domes giving it the appearance of a mosque, which it was
                    originally and later used by the Normans. The 13th century cloister with double
                    columns was charming.</p>
                <p>Then we stopped to see the cathedral, a beautiful and bewildering m�lange of
                    different types of architecture, Arabic, Norman and Gothic. In this church Roger
                    II was crowned first King of Sicily and here he is entombed with his successors
                    who were creators of 12th century Palermo.</p>
                <p>Down the little side street was the theater where the famous Sicilian puppets
                    performed and hoped one day to see. The gem of the palace we saw next where a
                    wedding was taking place was the Palatine Chapel, a priceless jewel of Arabian
                    art, Byzantine mosaics and Saracenic arches. The painted wooden ceiling was a
                    labyrinth of Arab intricate design known as honey comb. Never have I seen so
                    much beauty concentrated in such a small area. It is, and rightly so,
                    universally regarded as the richest and most exquisite royal chapel in
                    existence.</p>
                <p>We next went down into the catacombs of the Convent of the Cappuccinos, a ghostly
                    and gruesome spectacle of thousands mummified remains of the aristocratic
                    citizens who had been embalmed here in positions they had requested while still
                    alive, either sitting down or standing up. Remnants of splendid garments fitting
                    the body as elegantly in death as in life, still clung to bones like cobwebs
                    fluttering in the breeze that eddied through the dank tunneled corridor. This,
                    however, ceased in 1880. Every day, they say, the crypt is crowded with foreign
                    visitors. I don't know why.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>I was relieved when we drove up to see the famous Cathedral of Monreale and
                    looked back at the rich valley called the Conca d'Oro, Shell of Gold, and to the
                    sea beyond. Here was another gem of Sicily. Saracenic grace and delicacy,
                    Byzantine opulence and elegance and Norman strength and beauty. A wealth of
                    lavish decoration and the general effect was magnificent. Inside we stood
                    bewildered by the glow and glitter. The statue of Christ was surrounded by
                    dazzling mosaics portraying scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Outside
                    cloisters with quiet gardens led to terraces with a breathtaking view of Palermo
                    and the bay. It was a former Benedictine monastery, now a historic monument.</p>
                <p>In the old quarters of town every street and every alley had a wayside shrine. In
                    many of the cases there was only a small picture of a Christ, Madonna or saint
                    protected by glass and illuminated by faint oil lamp and frequently protected by
                    iron bars. Candles as well as oil lamps are lit on the day or days dedicated to
                    whomsoever it represents and may be seen burning every day since scores testify
                    in this way their gratitude for benefits received or plead for benefits to
                    come.</p>
                <p>In the center of Palermo was a conglomeration of 17th century architecture
                    memorials to Sicilian kings and tall columns with holy virgins of Palermo. This
                    strange mixture of Europe and Africa and the mingling of East and West,
                    Christian and Muslim was everywhere. A curious blending that gave Palermo a
                    fascinating character.</p>
                <p>Margaret Hussman, the visa issuing officer, just back from her holiday in England
                    came in and invited me to have dinner with her. She lives at the Mediterranio, a
                    nearby hotel, but does not serve meals. It is raining, but she drives a car. It
                    seems to rain without the slightest provocation, so I always carry my
                    umbrella.</p>
                <p>January 7, 1957</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>Everyone here talks about the Palmers who left about a month ago and were in
                    Bangkok where I liked them so much. I received a card from Charlie saying,
                    “Welcome to Palermo,” which I thought was sweet of him to send. I am studying
                    Italian like mad. Spent the entire weekend on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>Since writing to you last I have seen a place I am quite interested in that David
                    Begley is giving up February 15 as he is being transferred from his consulate to
                    Hanoi and he thought I might like it. When I saw it, I fell in love with it and
                    have taken it. It had been a coachman's house in the earlier days of stabling
                    and was tucked behind the old pink villa, Couchia, the ancestral name of the
                    property belonging to Baroness Potino on Via Liberta, a spacious avenue flanked
                    by handsome palaces and gardens. It was approached through the arch driveway of
                    the villa and so covered with vines it looked like an English cottage outside
                    and inside, because of the gay chintz-covered furniture. But there were touches
                    of Italian ambiance in the ancient tiled walls and floors. The family's private
                    chapel was attached on one side and a unique feature was a tiny opening between
                    the chapel and kitchen where the chalice could be passed through. Also a niche
                    in the kitchen where I eventually placed a gift from my Italian maid, Pena, a
                    statue of Santa Rose Leo, the patron saint of Palermo. There was a fireplace in
                    the salon downstairs, a small kitchen upstairs and a terrace paved with faded
                    tiles. The rent was $72 per month.</p>
                <p>The day I moved, the consulate sent a Jeep and trailer for my stuff, my new
                    Italian maid and me. The Baroness Potino, Jusapina Potino, had flowers in the
                    house and everything tastefully arranged. She presented me with the keys tied up
                    in a green satin ribbon. I thought I would need a special big bag to carry them
                    in. One was for the grill gate for the cars and one to walk through which were
                    locked at 9:30 at night and one for the house.</p>
                <p>The next morning I felt I was really in the country when I was waken by the birds
                    singing and looked out over the tops of the lemon and orange trees. Edna
                    Greenley, a colleague in the consulate, gave me a heater saying it was a
                    housewarming gift. Nothing could have been more appropriate and appreciated. My
                    own effects had been held up in Bangkok due to the Suez situation and didn't
                    arrive until mid-May, when I was unpacking things I hadn't seen for six
                    years.</p>
                <p>Margaret Hussman had just been made consul and chief of the visa section and was
                    trying to promote me. I am doing the best I can, but I am not frightfully
                    interested in this type of work. It seems rather dull after my glamorous job in
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>The Keeleys often entertained, especially when the navy ships were in. Mr. Keeley
                    was a congenial host and always greeted his guests playing with his amber prayer
                    beads, tranquilizing strands wrapped around his wrist. An Oriental habit
                    probably acquired at one of his former Arab posts.</p>
                <p>A lovely party was given aboard the Navy ship, Iowa, when the Auchinclosses
                    received with the Admiral as the Keeleys had gone to Rome to pay their respects
                    to the newly arrived Ambassador, Mr. Zellerbach. When shown over the ship I was
                    interested to see in the Captain's quarters the bathtub that President Roosevelt
                    had especially installed when he was aboard going to Yalta. We had the
                    opportunity of ordering some food stuff from the ship and I stocked up on tinned
                    things and, of course, navy beans.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Margaret Hussman very thoughtfully said to me on April 5th, why don't you go home
                    early, it is your birthday, and so, I did. And to my surprise was delighted to
                    find some lovely little orchids and an Italian green linen tray cloth from
                    Jusapina Potino and her sister Maria. General and Mrs. Thomas Camp, friends of
                    my friends the Jim Purdys in Washington, D.C., had arrived, so came to help me
                    celebrate with Margaret over a bottle of champagne. I later dined with them at
                    the Villa Igea, where the Camps were staying, a hotel beautifully situated in a
                    garden beside the sea on the outskirts of Palermo.</p>
                <p>One afternoon Ellis Debolto invited me to go with her and her husband, the Baron,
                    to see her daughter jump at Fabereta Park. It is a part at the foot of Mt.
                    Pelagreno, the big Gibraltar-like rock, landmark of this island. A Bourbon king
                    lost a bet over a game of Bezique and had to make it good by building a Chinese
                    fantasia there, and he did. So, with a flourish it was a kind of pavilion in
                    Chinese lacquer with pagoda roofs of green, pint and yellow tile and called it
                    La Fabereta.</p>
                <p>Lord Nelson and the notorious Lady Hamilton, whose beauty ravished so many men,
                    once lived there. It is said she painted a series of water colors that hung in
                    the salon.</p>
                <p>I sat with the Deboltos and their friends, Baron and Baroness Canolotti, in whose
                    14th century palace they have an apartment. The riders looked so pretty in their
                    red jackets. One little ten year old boy jumped with great elegance, even more
                    so than the president of the Riding Club. I hope to go more often to these
                    concourses. There is a big international one in October.</p>
                <p>Ellis and I went to see the film, “Anastasia,” one evening and when the Grand
                    Duchess, played by Helen Hayes, was flashed on the screen, she leaned over and
                    whispered to me, “Alex has a very nice letter at home from her.”</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Mrs. Metcalfe and her daughter, Gabrielle, who was with USIS, invited about 50
                    people to see the famous Sicilian puppet show. They thought it would be a more
                    original way of entertaining than the usual cocktail party and it certainly was.
                    The theater was a tiny barn-like place where we sat on wooden benches without
                    backs or arms. And to create the authentic atmosphere, munched melon seeds that
                    had been passed around while waiting for the performance. In one corner a
                    hurdy-gurdy played incessantly. The little play was in Italian, but Gabrielle
                    explained it to us in English. The puppet theater represents the same historic
                    incidents as many of the carvings on the colorful Sicilian carts. The epic
                    struggle between Christians and Saracens. The scenes are enchanting and the
                    quaint charm of the entertainment makes a curious emotional appeal. Everyone
                    follows the story with breathless interest. Such beautiful armor, meticulously
                    worked on, those puppets when they come clanking out on the stage with their
                    shining swords and spears and shields. Death of the Christian warriors brought
                    tears to the stoniest hearts, so nobly and pathetic were their dying speeches
                    and so realistic the languid gestures of their arms and the last twitches of
                    their bodies as the curtain falls. The curtain is grandly and pompously
                    decorated with paintings of battling Crusaders. We all loved it and I never saw
                    Mr. Keeley enjoy himself so much.</p>
                <p>Everyone in our visa section was terribly excited about one of the local staff,
                    Colaresi, going off to Bologna to enter the International Fencing Match. He is
                    the champion for all of Sicily and Southern Italy, so we sent him a telegram
                    wishing him good luck. He later went to the States to enter the World
                    Championship.</p>
                <p>That evening I was sitting to the right of Mr. Auchincloss at his dinner party. I
                    was telling him how I had learned to fence with one of the British officers on a
                    British freighter while zigzagging around the world and during the war in 1939.
                    He said he had fenced while at Yale.</p>
                <p>April 19, 1957</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>I was grateful to be in the haven of my own home when the sad news came of Dad's
                    death where I could be comforted by the dear sisters Jusapina and Maria Potino
                    who were ready to take me in their arms when I hung up the telephone. They
                    sensed what had happened when I wept and hear me say, “Put a red rose in his
                    buttonhole for me.” Then tucked me into bed with a warm drink and a hot water
                    bottle, for I was trembling so as I had rushed out into the night to their
                    telephone in my nighty and dressing gown. I remembered that he had a dream about
                    my house and mentioned this to them in French, they spoke no English. As I
                    looked at his portrait, said, “He was the handsomest man I have ever known and
                    still think so.”</p>
                <p>Saturday, April 20, 1957, at home, 10:30 Am</p>
                <p>My dearest sister,</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>You and I, dear, are now all that are left of our happy family. How I wish we
                    could be together at this sad hour to comfort each other. Bishop Rose called
                    soon after the news reached him and I asked about a requiem service for Dad.
                    Jusapina had said they would have a little memorial service in their family
                    chapel next to me, even though it is Roman Catholic. I was very touched. I feel
                    so helpless not being there to participate in dear Dad's last rites. These
                    services here will help. The news had reached Mrs. Keeley and Mrs. Kyle, who
                    were decorating the church for Easter and came to offer condolences as did the
                    Poles with flowers. When many inquired if I would return to the States, Eddie
                    said I would not be able to get off the island anyway. Everything, air and ship,
                    are booked until the end of the month. Mrs. Kyle spoke up and said, well in this
                    emergency we could arrange something I am sure.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Keeley offered her car and driver and invited me for luncheon tomorrow, but
                    Margaret Hussman and I had already planned to go to Piana de Gregshe. At first I
                    thought I wouldn't go, but Mrs. Keeley thought I should rather than be alone.
                    Everyone was being so dear. Many go up into the hills to see the interesting
                    people of this Albanian colony come down from their village at this time of the
                    year in their colorful costumes as they come out of church. The women wear long
                    dark skirts and brightly colored velvet bodices, opened to show a snowy bosom.
                    They immigrated here as a result of the Turkish subjugation of Albania. They
                    speak the Albanian language, belong to the Orthodox church and have special
                    festivals of their own.</p>
                <p>It was a lovely day and we drove into the country for our picnic lunch. All along
                    the roadside were many of our friends doing the same. Occasionally we stopped to
                    pick wild flowers. I felt it was just what Dad wanted me to do on Easter
                    Day.</p>
                <p>Margaret brought me home along the seaside and we stopped and sat on the terrace
                    of the little pavilion where we had a cool drink. It was there that I decided I
                    would like to get away for a few days.</p>
                <p>The weather is beginning to be pleasant. I feel so sad that I believe it will
                    bring me some little solace. Before I returned last evening, the Auchinclosses
                    had come around and left a note. “Dear Virginia, John and I are so sorry that
                    you have had such sad news. It is dreadful to be too far away to not be able to
                    return home in time to say your last goodbye to your father, but I hope there
                    will be comfort in knowing that he lived fully and in good health for so long
                    and that you did have a chance to enjoy each other again not so very long ago.
                    We are thinking of you a great deal. We wondered if by any chance you would like
                    to spend tonight here with us. We would love to have you here under our roof. We
                    expect to be home from 4:30. We would love to have you for supper, too, a little
                    after 9:00, if you would like that. Don't bother to let us know, we know you
                    have no phone, but please feel free to come anytime you want and don't feel any
                    obligation to us that you must come or call us. This is just that we want you to
                    know we are here. Very sincerely, Audrey” I have quoted it verbatim so you will
                    see how wonderful they are.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>Then Audrey came to see me and asked me to talk about Dad if I wanted to, and I
                    did. Then took me home with her and had supper, but did not spend the night.
                    They were perfect dears and lent me the book, “Wonders of Italy,” when they
                    learned you and I plan to see the hill towns. Love Virginia</p>
                <p>Another wave of sadness sweeps over me as I type this letter knowing that never
                    ever will it again be “Dearest Mildred and Dad.”</p>
                <p>Easter Monday, April 21, 1957, 3:10pm</p>
                <p>Dearest Mildred,</p>
                <p>If I have calculated the time correctly, in just about an hour our dear father
                    will be lying beside our dear mother. It is not easy to bare this great lost at
                    this great distance, but so grateful the Bishop was able to arrange a requiem
                    service at 9:00 this morning in the lovely Anglican church where I often
                    worshiped. It was beautiful. I sat between the Bishop's wife, Mrs. Rose, who has
                    also been most comforting, and Margaret Hussman. Audrey and John Auchincloss
                    were also there and Joy Pole, Ellis Debolto and Jean Smith, who volunteered to
                    play the organ. The visa section had sent some lovely white carnations which I
                    placed on the alter. I felt it was a beautiful time for Dad to go for now he has
                    risen with our Lord. May God comfort you in our great sorrow. With all my love,
                    Virginia</p>
                <p>I had written to Dad, April 15th, my sister's birthday</p>
                <p>“Dearest Dad,</p>
                <p>I have just received your letter written on April 9 and nothing makes me happier
                    to have good news from you. It sounds as if you are so much better and in good
                    spirits. I wait so eagerly to hear from you and do hope by now you will keep as
                    fit as when I last saw you. Oh, how I, too, wish I could be sitting in the swing
                    with you again, basking in the sun. Those were happy days with you.”</p>
                <p>I cherished every moment I spent with him in his declining years and he meant
                    more and more to me each time I was with him on home leave, but this was to be
                    my last letter and never was seen by him because Good Friday, the 19th, the
                    telephone call came from my sister that he had died on Maundy Thursday, the
                    18th.</p>
                <p>I did book a trip around the island with CIT (that's the tourist bureau) and on
                    Sunday, April 28, 1957 I wrote my sister from the Grand Hotel, Catania,
                    Sicily.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>This is a modern deluxe hotel equal to the Waldorf with heated towel racks and
                    telephone in the bathroom. Such a surprise especially after passing through so
                    much that was BC. From my room I have superb view of Mt. Etna through an
                    enormous picture window that makes a perfect frame for Europe's highest volcano.
                    It is soaring in the distance, gently spuming faint plumes of smoke at the
                    moment with a bit of snow still on its sides. The unique feature of the city of
                    Catania is that it has been destroyed eight times and rebuilt almost entirely of
                    lava. The Elephant of Catania, known as the heart of lava, holds up a fountain
                    in the main square, but it is the grandeur of Etna that dominates the scene
                    here. At Siracusa I stayed at the Politi Hotel charming situated where I had a
                    balcony overlooking the blue sea. The weather has been divine now.</p>
                <p>Audrey Auchincloss has sent me a note just before I left saying, “I hope your
                    heart will not be too heavy to really enjoy Sicily in the spring.” My heart is
                    still heavy, but I am greatly solaced by at last finding spring in Sicily. There
                    is so much of historical interest around Siracusa. The Greek theater is
                    indestructible as it is cut out of a stone hill and plays are still performed
                    here. The stone quarries where Athenian prisoners were taken to die of heat and
                    thirst after losing their naval battle, is now a beautiful orange scented garden
                    where Winston Churchill comes to paint. The ear of Dionysus...it was constructed
                    to hear every whisper of his prisoners so extraordinary were the acoustics.
                    Arethusa Fountain, where the fish and geese who float there preserve the water,
                    where weeds and papyrus grow that were imported by the Arabs is famous. In June
                    1798, Admiral Nelson sailed into Siracusa with 14 warships and remained five
                    days. It is said in a letter he wrote to Lord Hamilton that he had taken on
                    provisions and fresh water there since water drawn from the fountain of Arethusa
                    would certainly gain a victory. The prophecy was realized for his warships
                    sailed out from Siracusa to win the battle of Aboukir.</p>
                <p>I was so delighted when I heard we were to include a visit to Piazza Armenia to
                    see those recently discovered mosaics I had read about with such interest in the
                    National Geographic magazine. The Romans, in contrast to the Greeks, who built
                    for views on spectacular sites, chose the sheltered spots and much is preserved
                    intact of the mosaic pavement in this imperial villa depicting the luxurious
                    life of a Roman ruler, including the savage beasts the ancient Romans hunted in
                    Africa, and women who had their own steam baths and gym and wore bikini bathing
                    suits. To see them to advantage, one must climb and look down on them.</p>
                <p>We drove through some quaint 16th century towns. In one little town, Vizzini, the
                    story of the opera “Cavalleria Rusticana,” was written. The sea is bright blue
                    and we have passed some lovely beaches. The fields are full of yellow daisies
                    and lots of purple clover for the cows. The 5th century architecturally was the
                    most dramatic period of Greek history and Sicily enriched it with temples we
                    were most admiring today. It is said a city's statues could be judged by the
                    number of and wealth of temples. They were a talisman of her treasures on the
                    crown of the hill visible to all. Segesta and Selinunte. The main beauty of
                    these ruins is their state of dilapidation. Noble mementoes of antiquity which
                    speak so eloquently of fallen greatness and nothingness of man.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>Given an interest in classical literature, history and mythology, archeologically
                    the sights seen are bound to grow on one.</p>
                <p>Taormina was a paradise and the grandeur of its setting makes it truly one of the
                    most unique among the pleasure resorts of the world. It clings to its own cliffs
                    on Mt. Tauro above the sea. And the majesty of Mt. Etna soars above it all in
                    the distance. Taormina is very proud of their volcano for they claim they can
                    forecast the weather by the smoke signals. I was booked at the Excelsior Hotel,
                    but changed to the Timeo where I could almost touch the ruins of the Greek
                    theater from my bathroom window.</p>
                <p>When I came downstairs the next morning, I was presented with a lovely bouquet of
                    lavender sweet peas and charming from Culver Sherrill saying that he understood
                    I wouldn't want any parties, but asked if I would come in at 7:00 for a drink.
                    Just a few friends would be there and we would be going on for dinner
                    afterwards. So I accepted and met two chaps from Rome on holiday. A Mr. Van
                    Brown from the United States, and a countess, who I had met there before and had
                    admired her sweet bright face. Culver showed me a bit more of his fabulous
                    house, swimming pool and gardens where he picked a white camilla for me. We had
                    interesting conversation and Culver said he always felt so flattered that Clare
                    Booth Luce, our American Ambassador in Rome, told friends the only two things to
                    see in Taormina are the Greek theater and Culver Sherrill. I am writing him a
                    thank you note saying, “Yes, this is true, but one can enjoy seeing the Greek
                    theater once, but Culver Sherrill again and again,” which is a fact for he is
                    delightful, witty and very hospitable. I appreciated so much his kind thought of
                    me.</p>
                <p>The next morning I left Taormina at 8:00 in the morning very reluctantly. I could
                    have remained in that heavenly spot for ever. For many it had served as an
                    escape from reality. Lovers of beauty came here as to an enchanted spring that
                    would quench any thirst. And anyone seeking consolation for their souls from the
                    turbulent progress of life will find it in the voices of the past. It had done
                    just that for me at this time.</p>
                <p>On the drive back to Palermo, we stopped at Chefalu, perched deliciously above
                    the Tyrrhenian Sea and backed by a miniature rock of Gibraltar. Chefalu's chief
                    glory lies in the marvelous mosaics in the Norman cathedral practically as they
                    were when installed in the 12th century. The famous mosaic, Head of Christ,
                    whose eyes follow you through the church, is said to have provided a model for
                    the better known and larger Monde all Cathedral.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>When I returned to the consulate, everyone was busy making our office as
                    presentable as possible for the visit of Ambassador Zellerbach. I rushed out and
                    bought three fuchsia plants for our balcony and was pleased when Mr. Auchincloss
                    and Mr. Memminger, the Supervising Consul at the embassy in Rome, remarked about
                    them. About 300 invitations had been extended to the Italians for the reception
                    held in the garden of the Villa Igea, which had the right note of grandeur. Many
                    of the aristocracy who came bore names of the proudest names of Sicily. Mr.
                    Auchincloss introduced Count Periera, Prince Mirto, and Prince Gangai.</p>
                <p>As we were all standing together speaking French, Mrs. Fenzi came up and said,
                    “Mrs. Biddle is the most charming person in Palermo.” I felt suddenly flattered
                    by such gracious compliment and thought what a charming person she was to pay me
                    such a spontaneous compliment, especially in the presence of Prince Gangai as I
                    had heard the ladies of the Gangai family were reported in every generation
                    among the most ravishing in Palermo. And the palazzo Gangai in Magueda had a
                    long romantic history.</p>
                <p>The Auchinclosses have a great many friends here and are charming and gracious to
                    everyone and so kind to the staff. Ellis Debolto said yesterday that they are so
                    well breed it is a pleasure just to look at them.</p>
                <p>One day, when I was lunching at Lucapres, I recognized the former Japanese
                    Ambassador to Bangkok and his wife, who I remember had been transferred to Rome.
                    We had a brief conversation and I heard the Portuguese Charg� d'Affaires was
                    also posted in Rome, a most attractive diplomat I often sat next to at official
                    dinners because protocol-wise we were both usually placed below the salt as we
                    were low men on the totem pole.</p>
                <p>The Fourth of July was celebrated here by a picnic with the Americans at
                    Mandello.</p>
                <p>My sister was on route to visit me, and in a letter to reach her in London, I
                    wrote, September 13, 1957</p>
                <p>Dear Mildred,</p>
                <p>So glad you saw “The Boyfriend.” I nearly rolled in the aisle laughing. It
                    reminded me so of my boarding days at Briar Cliff in the twenties. No more news
                    except to wish you a pleasant flight over and assure you that I will be at the
                    airport with open arms to welcome you to Palermo.</p>
                <p>But the day I was leaving the consulate to meet Mildred, I got stuck in the
                    elevator and panicky I would not get to the plane in time. All the staff tried
                    to pacify me by calling down the shaft, “Don't worry, we will get you there.”
                    And by some mechanical miracle they did. Then the parties began and a tour
                    around the island.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>We were entertained by Culver Sherrill, the ever hospitable host in Taormina and
                    from there across the Straits of Messina to the mainland of Italy on a marvelous
                    rapido train. We stopped in Sorrento and had fun in Capri giggling like two
                    silly school girls as we lay flat on the boat as we had to do to go in and out
                    of the Blue Grotto. I really preferred Anacapri where we roamed through
                    Axelmonthi's interesting home and museum. We took a motor tour through the hill
                    towns stopping at Assisi to visit a friend, Mrs. Rockwell. In Florence stayed at
                    our favorite pension, the Tornabuoni Biacchi. The charming proprietress knew
                    Mrs. Fenzi, Orlando Biacchi, daughter of the Countess Biacchi, who had died, was
                    a friend of Mrs. Rockwell.</p>
                <p>From here I bid goodbye to Mildred who returned to the States. The next day I
                    booked a tour to Siena and San Gimignano, after passing once more the Baptistery
                    to gaze in admiration at the gold reliefs of Ghiberti's famous doors. San
                    Gimignano's imposing towers of nobility are unique in Italy and all of Europe.
                    Only noble families were permitted to build a tower near their palaces. In the
                    16th century there were 65, but time and wars have reduced this number and some
                    were dangerous and had to be topped. Each noble contrived to build his tower
                    just a little higher than his rivals. Finally an end was put to this foolishness
                    by having a limitation, although some nobles tried to get around the law by
                    embellishing their towers with a Pisan-like lean just to advertise the
                    virtuosity of their architects. I heard that an American woman bought one and is
                    living in it.Like many painters and writers, I felt the charm of the place
                    deeply.</p>
                <p>Siena was more interesting than I had remembered. The cathedral, older than the
                    one in Florence, built from bricks with the breathtaking red color, “terra
                    d'siena.”</p>
                <p>When my plane from Rome landed at Palermo, the Auchinclosses were at the airport
                    to meet some friends and very kindly drove me home, bringing me up to date on
                    the news. I had not heard, however, that the office hours had been changed and
                    arrived a half hour early to find a note of thanks from Culver Sherrill for the
                    chocolates Mildred and I had sent from Perushia.</p>
                <p>My French friend, Andre Triolet, wrote he was finding the life in Tangier, “very
                    boring.” His English was amusing at times. And Yvonne Sonleshe wrote, “What
                    would you think if I paid you a visit?” So, the two came. Andre, by the
                    Independence and stayed at the Palma Hotel, and Yvonne by train and stayed with
                    me. I gave a cocktail party of 15 for them and when Mr. Keeley arrived without
                    Mrs. Keeley, when I asked where she was he said, “Oh, she is in bed with that
                    Greek.” When I exclaimed, “What?” He added, with a twinkle in his eye,
                    “laryngitis.”</p>
                <p>I showed Andre and Yvonne the usual sights I had seen. On Sunday we visited St.
                    John the Hermit and Monreale and the Palatine Chapel, where Mr. Cheli, the Chief
                    of Protocol, who had given me a little Sicilian card and sent a couple of cards
                    to me from the Scandinavian countries, rushed out and kissed my hand and said
                    the German President had just preceded us into the Chapel.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>The Baroness Jusapina Potino invited us for luncheon and as she spoke only
                    French, it was enjoyable.</p>
                <p>The consular staff had been invited on board the Julius Caesar an Italian liner
                    going to South America, so Yvonne and I joined the grand tour of the ship with
                    Mr. Keeley, the Auchinclosses and Lottie and Joe Kyle. When the Prefect with his
                    chic wife, the Captain of the ship and the Captain of the Port joined us for
                    cocktails, there was an explosion of flashbulbs. After the champagne and this
                    excitement, Yvonne and I were in high spirit when we met Andre for dinner at
                    Lucapres and had a gay time. They left for Taormina the next day with a note of
                    introduction to Culver Sherrill.</p>
                <p>One evening there was a costume party at the Beach Club in Mandello for benefit
                    of the poor. I thought I would wear my Japanese bride's kimono, but regretted I
                    did not have a black wig. My French hairdresser, Pierre, said he could dye my
                    hair black for one night, but I didn't think it was quite that necessary. So
                    just tucked a white chrysanthemum on each side of my head. Pena helped me get
                    into the complicated obi. When the Kyles called for me, people must have
                    wondered where we escaped from. Joe got out of the car dressed as Napoleon with
                    the proverbial hat and suit shining with gold braid and gold epaulets, all much
                    too big for him. But he was as handsome as Lottie was ugly, as a witch. She had
                    on a sleazy black satin dress, black stringy wig with horn rimmed glasses on to
                    which was attached a nose, what a nose. It was enormous and hooked and had a
                    slight off-center look to it. And she carried, of course, a broomstick.</p>
                <p>Don Herdick, where we went for cocktails, accentuated his tallness by wearing a
                    white fur Cossack hat with his Russian costume, rented as most were, from the
                    Nasomo Theater. His wife came as a 15th century Desdemona. The Slutzes were in
                    Spanish costumes. Bob said his costume was big enough for the bull and himself.
                    Rose was pretty with a black mantilla covering a big comb and a rose over one
                    ear. We all commented on each other's costumes and everyone said to me, “You are
                    really authentic, aren't you.”</p>
                <p>After a few drinks we were ready to leave and Don, to be hospitable asked if
                    anyone wanted to go to the bathroom. Looking at everyone else and thinking about
                    my own tight costume, I couldn't help but say, “Oh, it is too difficult.” For a
                    brief moment there was embarrassed silence and then a roar of laughter.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>The Club was prettily decorated with balloons and a great array of costumes. It
                    was amusing to see three musketeers doing the rock and roll, a priest the
                    jitterbug. Gradually people began to take off bits of their costumes and wigs,
                    hats, swords and veils to be more comfortable while dancing. Later an
                    announcement was made there would be a parade for judging the costumes and a
                    half hour is allowed to get back into their bits and pieces. We all marched
                    around to be judged and I can hardly believe my ears when I heard the master of
                    ceremonies say, “The first prize for the most beautiful lady's costume goes to
                    the little lady in Japanese costume.” After I recovered from my surprise I
                    walked up and made a low bow in true Japanese fashion and Don Herdick waltzed me
                    off with the prize.</p>
                <p>The next day I went with Margaret Hussman to the Deboltos for tea and met their
                    very good friends the Duke Deboltos and his Danish wife. He was the Swedish and
                    Danish Consul and he knew Alf Herdom, my Norwegian friend from Honolulu, who was
                    first a composer of music, then an artistic when he found Honolulu more
                    conducive to painting than composing. I related the time I had attended a
                    concert with him when Kirsten Flagstaff sang some of his songs and she announced
                    that the composer was in the audience and how proud I felt to be with him when
                    he rose and bowed.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately I caught a cold over the holidays and was in bed on Christmas Day.
                    But matters could always be worse. Poor Lora, a local in our office, fell and
                    broke her leg at Margaret Hussman's party jitterbugging with her husband.</p>
                <p>As I had to use four days of my leave before January 11 or lose them, I made an
                    effort to recover sufficiently to go to Tunis. At the airport, two Americans
                    introduced themselves, a Mr. McCann and a Mr. Hughes, studying at the University
                    in Cambridge, England. They apparently were going to the same hotel I was, the
                    Majestic, so we all piled in a tiny Renault, that looked like a baby carriage,
                    with our luggage. I was most fortunate to find such heavenly sunshine which
                    quickly baked out my cold. It was good to see again the men in the red fez and
                    the women in their white veils against the gleaming white flat top houses. With
                    a guide I went through the souks, Medina and Casbah and after lunch engaged him
                    again to go out to the El Bardo museum, considered, and rightly so, the best
                    archeological museum in French North Africa. It was formerly a harem of the
                    Turkish dynasty and turned into a museum in 1888. Actually, it is four museums
                    in one. A Punic, a Roman, Byzantine, Christian and Arab, each with many items of
                    significance. The collection of mosaics are the most extensive in the world.
                    Colorfully dressed guards were standing at the entrance of the Palace of the
                    Bey, adjunct to the museum, where the Bey of Tunis, under French protection,
                    visits three times a year. The guide was excellent so I engaged him again the
                    next day.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>We took the train to Sidi-bou-Said passing small villages along the Gulf on one
                    side and the Lake of Tunis on the other. After about half an hour we reached
                    this adorable native village perched on the side of the hill. I followed my
                    guide in his flowing robes which seemed to float in the air, up the narrow
                    street with pretty Moorish houses all painted with the traditional blue-trim to
                    keep the evil spirits away. At the end rose an elegant minaret. We lunched on a
                    delicious sole at a perfectly charming restaurant, Dar Zarrouk, situated on
                    tiered terraces overlooking the calm, shimmering Gulf. All the tables, chairs,
                    and even pots of flowers were painted the same shade of blue as the sea beyond
                    and gave it a most lovely effect. Inside the restaurant the pillars and walls
                    were draped with the carpet so well made, all knotted by hand in this part of
                    the world. The hotel, just a few steps up the hill was a dream place. It was
                    warm, peaceful and quiet and I vowed I must return again one day. I even thought
                    I might like to retire here. A small house, I was told would cost about $25 a
                    month. Greta Garbo had a hideaway beyond the cafe where she left her signature
                    on the shutters. This village has since been made an historical monument. I did
                    return here once again and brought back a bird cage so artistically made, and
                    made only here, in Sidi-Bou-Said by certain families. We looked over toward the
                    beautiful and magnificently situated home of the late Baron d'Erlanger. He was a
                    well-known Arab student who translated ancient works of Arab music and founded a
                    conservatory for the renovation of Tunisian music.</p>
                <p>Cartage laid beyond which we next visited. It was not only of great historical
                    interest, but many Americans and other diplomats have homes there as well as
                    Gustave Flaubert, who wrote “Salambo,” there in a villa of the same name. From
                    the train window I could see the American flag flying from our Ambassador's
                    residence, Mr. G. Lewis Jones, who I had met in Paris and with whom I had a very
                    pleasant chat at the embassy when I arrived in Tunis. We drove around Cartage in
                    a carriage. It was beautifully situated on the sea and the reason it rose again
                    and again after being so often destroyed. It was at one time second to Rome in
                    greatness. In the Arabic Byzantine cathedral were fragments of the mortal
                    remains of King Louis IX of France, the Crusading St. Louis, who died in the
                    siege of his attack when it was a Muslim center. Above the alter is a very
                    handsome reliquary in gilt bronze representing the Sanchapelle of Paris, built
                    by Louis IX with relics of the royal saint from the church of Monreale in
                    Sicily.</p>
                <p>Sidi-Bou-Said bares its name in Arabic disguise.</p>
                <p>The following day with my same guide in a taxi with three others, drove to Nabuel
                    where the pottery was made, also embroidery, grass mats and lampshades. Then on
                    to Hamamet where we had an excellent lunch of enormous shrimps with a mayonnaise
                    made with a wonderful olive oil. I saw how they made the oil later. They use the
                    tiny olives for this. My guide got a special permit for me to visit the Casbah,
                    where an armed soldier showed us around. I must come back here in May and go
                    down to the lovely, lotus eating island Gjerba. (I did several years later.)</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>When I arrived at the Palermo airport from Tunis Mr. Keeley was there with Joe
                    Kyle and many others to bid goodbye to the ex-president of the region who was
                    going to the United States, and drove me home. The surprising news I had
                    received was that Mr. Auchincloss was being transferred to Trieste as principal
                    officer. His job here was abolished. Apparently Audrey is quite enthused about
                    going there. They will live in splendor in an enormous house with swimming pool
                    and any number of servants, and of course it will be wonderful for Mr.
                    Auchincloss to have his own post. But we all will miss them terribly.</p>
                <p>When we all saw the Auchinclosses off, I certainly had a lump in my throat when I
                    waved goodbye. They left me a lot of wood for my fireplace that was delivered in
                    one of those colorful wonderful little Sicilian carts. Everything is carried in
                    these two wheeled donkey carts and are seen here in all their glory. Intricate
                    carvings of scenes from the islands, fiery history, battle conquest and
                    religious furor painted in flamboyant colors, red, yellow, blue and green, to
                    symbolize Sicily's oranges, sun, sea and grass, are all done by hand. The
                    trappings of the donkey are glittering with sequence, flowers and ribbons and
                    studded with tiny mirrors to divert the evil eye. Builders, carvers and painters
                    hand on historical episodes from father to son. There are copies in all sizes
                    and make charming souvenirs from Sicily.</p>
                <p>I invited the Auchinclosses for lunch one day with the padre and Baroness
                    Jusapina Potino, and Felipo from the consulate served. Pena preferred not to as
                    she lost her brother while I was in Tunis and said it was too soon to even put
                    on a white apron over her black uniform. The day she returned she looked so sad
                    in deep mourning with the black shawl on. Her brother accompanied her, and
                    apologized for his beard, explaining it was the custom for men to grow beards
                    when there has been a death in the family.</p>
                <p>Upon returning from Tunis I found among my mail a charming letter from Baron von
                    Plason, saying, “Had I known you were in Capri, we might have seen each other
                    last summer for before leaving Naples for Bangkok on September 11 on board of
                    Celandia , I spent a delightful week in Capri with my cousin, Eddie Bismarck and
                    his very rich American wife, formerly Mrs. Harrison Williams, known as the best
                    dressed woman in the world.” Of course, I too was very sorry that we did not see
                    each other.</p>
                <p>Also came a gift of a book from Helen Keller just the sort to keep on the bedside
                    table to dip into now and then. Her thoughts are like spiritual vitamins. When
                    we do the best we can we never know what miracle is brought into our lives or
                    into the life of another. And a letter from my Swiss friend, Jacqueline Cramer,
                    asking for rates of hotels here and about the weather. She wants to come and do
                    some painting. But, best of all was an efficiency report from Margaret
                    Hussman.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>Then came an amusing invitation from Culver Sherrill to a carnivali party. The
                    note at the bottom read, “Come lose your head, and beg, barrow, or steal another
                    for the occasion.” As implied just a head dress was required. I was so glad I
                    had bought a white wig I saw in a shop window on Saturday. Pena helped me
                    decorate it with a black velvet ribbon wound with pearls and pretty pink rose.
                    And, I found a black mask edged with lace to complete the disguise.</p>
                <p>A letter to my sister Mildred written from Hotel Timeo, Taormina, Sicily,
                    Saturday, February 15, 1968</p>
                <p>I left Palermo in a London fog and since arriving here it has been coming and
                    going ever since. From the balcony of my room this morning I had a thrill seeing
                    Mt. Etna covered with snow and fuming with smoke. Then the mist came and hid it
                    all from view. It has been like a veil, raising itself to give one a glimpse of
                    beauty, like a Chinese print.</p>
                <p>When I arrived yesterday afternoon, I said to the nice manager, Mr. Berndt, that
                    I wanted to see the historical monuments this time and he very kindly sent his
                    English speaking German secretary with me. On the Corso I happened to see Culver
                    Sherrill and said that I was seeing all the old ruins. And he replied in his
                    characteristic way, “and you will see another tomorrow night.” I suppose he
                    meant his house after the party is over.</p>
                <p>The hotel is filled. Mrs. Fenzi from Palermo is here to see her cousins, the
                    Copelands. Mrs. Copeland had been a former Member of Parliament and a great
                    friend of Winston Churchill. She is quite elderly and her husband nearly blind.
                    We all piled into a tiny taxi and went together to Culver Sherrill's party,
                    which was very gay. Mr. Keeley was there as a sheik with some pearls hanging
                    over his forehead.</p>
                <p>I met quite a few interesting people, including Eugene Bonner, whose book,
                    “Sicily Roundabout,” I had just bought the day before and was told it was
                    completely sold out in America. We met at the piazza for tomato juice the next
                    morning where he autographed it for me. It is the place where some how or other
                    everybody manages to find themselves between 12-1:00 to pass the time of day,
                    make engagements or amuse themselves in general.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Fenzi asked me to sit with them at an excellent place to watch the floral
                    parade. The streets were strung with lights. There was a treasure hunt by car
                    and people were dashing all over, the treasure being 60,000 Lira. From our
                    balcony we could watch the crowds of people from all over the country parading
                    the streets, throwing confetti at one another, blowing trumpets, clowning,
                    joking, laughing and shouting. The carnival spirit was contagious so we joined
                    in the fun by throwing down paper streamers at the passing flood of
                    participants.</p>
                <p>The Keeleys came back on the same train with me and Culver came to the station to
                    see us off and kissed me goodbye. We didn't reach Palermo until after midnight
                    and shared a taxi. I had dropped them off first.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>The next morning Mr. Keeley telephoned to ask if I got home all right. He said he
                    was worried about me and had looked up my number in the directory but when he
                    saw it was just an emergency number, the Potinos, he didn't call, but thought a
                    lot about it afterwards. I felt deeply touched that he was so concerned about
                    me.</p>
                <p>Everyone was going to the festival at Agrigento to see the lovely almond
                    blossoms, so one Sunday I went up at 7:00 in the morning, stayed on for the
                    illumination of the temples and fireworks and returned to Palermo at 11:30pm.
                    While there I met a delightful Englishman, Mr. Byers, who had been a guest of
                    the British Ambassador, Sir Barclay Gage in Bangkok when I was posted there. But
                    it was during the Queen Grandmother cremation when the Court was in mourning, so
                    they did not go out but drank their whisky sodas behind drawn blinds.</p>
                <p>The next day the inspectors arrived, Mr. Rice and Mr. Hart, with their wives.
                    When I met Mr. Hart he said, “I hear you are an expert on hotels in Paris.” As
                    he had never been there and they go in August, I gave him a list, but regretted
                    the Vouillamont, where I loved living for four years, was no longer there. I
                    heard it is now a school.</p>
                <p>I invited them to my little house for cocktails one Sunday, but unfortunately it
                    turned out to be a cold, rainy evening. Poor Mr. Keeley came but with a cold and
                    when I said how kind of him to come out, he said, “Well, I remember that nice
                    fire.” My fireplace did emanate a nice welcome of real flames. The first thing
                    he said to the inspectors was, “You should have seen this house when Mrs.
                    Biddle's predecessor had it. He even had chickens up on the terrace.” I was
                    amused, but pleased he pointed this out. Mr. Hart wanted to see the whole house,
                    so I gave him a private inspection tour. He was interested in knowing what I
                    paid for everything and seemed to find it very charming.</p>
                <p>Margaret Hussman and I received an airgram from the Department regarding our home
                    leaves. We are the only ones due this fiscal year. We must also fill in our post
                    preference reports. I requested leave December 24, exactly two years from the
                    date I arrived and preferred my next assignment to be in a warm climate where I
                    could do protocol work again. It depends where my post is, but if at all
                    possible I should like to have Pena with me. She said, “Senora, I will follow
                    you anyplace but darkest Africa.” She didn't like hot countries. She was excited
                    about coming to the States and when I told her my sister was inquiring about a
                    visa for her, with tears in her eyes she picked up Dad's photo from my dressing
                    table and said, “I will pray to your dear departed Father for the dead know what
                    is in one's heart.”</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>One Sunday after lunching with the Fenzis at Mondello at their lovely villa by
                    the sea, they took me with them to have tea at Miss Delia Whittacker's. She was
                    a very classical maiden lady in mourning for her mother who died at the age of
                    99. I was told when she was a child she sat on the lap of Garibaldi, the great
                    general whose conquest of Sicily in 1860 with his thousands, was a famous
                    expedition and proclaimed a great epic. Their fabulous home, Malfitano, was
                    filled with precious collections. A pair of cloisonn� elephants came from the
                    summer palace in Peking and on one table was an autographed photograph of the
                    former king of Italy. When I said goodbye she asked to come to my little house
                    sometime.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Fenzi and I went to see the film, “Sayonara,” together and she was a
                    wonderful person to see it with for she told me she had visited Japan in 1921
                    when her Italian brother-in-law was Naval Attach� at the Italian legation. It
                    was at the time the then Prince of Wales made his first visit and she attended
                    all of the elaborate functions given in his honor. Ernestino, her daughter, was
                    then only four years old with flaming red hair which was such a curiosity that
                    the Emperor turned and stared and stared at her when passing in a
                    procession.</p>
                <p>I also went to see “The Ten Commandments.” It is such a thrill to see the name of
                    Leroy Prines who arranged the dances in both films flash across the screen in a
                    foreign country, who was the son of my old dancing master, Prof Prines, I had as
                    a child in St. Joseph, Missouri.</p>
                <p>I received a long letter from Sarah Redman, telling me her husband Roland,
                    obtained his Florida divorce and married the Princess Lydia d'Fonstino Bodrero,
                    half Italian, half American, and one time wife of Ballentine Macy. So she moved
                    out of White Elephant and found an old ranch type house right on the way to
                    Sagamore Hill with a charming little brook running across the end of the front
                    lawn, complete with a small waterfall and has a nice guest room. Frances
                    Roosevelt is teaching in the university about four miles from where she lives.
                    Her interesting neighbors were Horst, leading German photographer for Vogue and
                    Nicholas Lawford, English and erstwhile British Foreign Service and secretary to
                    Anthony Eden, just writing his memories in three volumes. She has already
                    established a sherry/biscuit before lunch get-together which she find popular.
                    She hopes to get to Sicily during my tour of duty.</p>
                <p>April 5, 1958, at home</p>
                <p>I am just up from my breakfast and preparing to arrange the flowers for my
                    birthday party tonight. Pena brought me some lovely yellow tulips which I shall
                    arrange in Japanese flower arrangement in the green Peking glass bowl for the
                    center of the dining table. And the gardener brought some sprays of white
                    climbing roses for the two 17th century pots on the console tables. Miss
                    Whittacker had sent some gorgeous birds of paradise from her garden, so you see
                    my little house was like a bower of flowers. I did not tell anyone that it was
                    my birthday, but word does get around.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>The Poles invited me to dinner the 18th, remembering it would be a sad day for
                    me, the day we lost our dear father just a year ago. I was very touched that
                    they would think of me on this sad day.</p>
                <p>Such a charming handwritten letter was received from Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy,
                    dated April 1, 1958. “Dear Mrs. Biddle,</p>
                <p>It was a joy to receive news of you at Christmas time and to know that you were
                    well and happy. It must be wonderful to travel around like you and see so many
                    different countries. We have been in Florida the entire winter and the season
                    has been most disappointing, cold, rainy, blustering. After Easter we go north
                    and then I am going to go to California to visit my daughter, Patricia, who is
                    married to the movie actor, Peter Lawford. All my family are very well and my
                    two sons are working hard in Washington. I do hope to meet you again on some of
                    my travels. My best wishes to you always, Very sincerely, Rose Kennedy.”</p>
                <p>Then a typewritten letter came in the same mail dated April 18, 1958.</p>
                <p>“Dear Mrs. Biddle,</p>
                <p>In answering your Christmas card I noticed on the decorating map a picture of a
                    small Sicilian donkey cart. I recall such a cart as a decoration at Ambassador
                    Luce's when I was in Rome. I would appreciate it so much if you would send me
                    one of these carts as I think it would be wonderful with a doll collection which
                    my daughter is making. I know that it can be sent duty free and am enclosing a
                    check for $10. Will you address the package to me at Hyannis Port,
                    Massachusetts, and please mark it Attention: Wobert Marsh. If the cart exceeds
                    $10, please let me know, and if less, please drop the money into a box for the
                    poor in one of the churches. I am most grateful to you for your cooperation.
                    Very sincerely, Rose Kennedy”</p>
                <p>Of course I wrote and acknowledged both letters and said I would be very pleased
                    to select one for her this Saturday when I go down town.</p>
                <p>I often went on picnics with the Fenzis. I loved being with them. One Sunday we
                    drove along the beach and picnicked among the wild flowers which we picked
                    later. On that day Mrs. Fenzi had on a stunning Shetland wool suit. She said she
                    had bought the material in Scotland and had Mussolini's tailor make it. He
                    admitted he never tailors for women, but as his son went to school with her
                    husband's nephew, he did it as a favor.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>I invited them to luncheon the following Saturday with Miss Whittacker who
                    stepped out of her liveried, chauffeur driven car bearing the most gorgeous
                    bouquet of amaryllis lilies from her enormous garden, which I appreciated so
                    much. After lunch she wanted Mr. Fenzi to take her to the botanical gardens,
                    which I understood was the finest in Europe, where Mr. Fenzi's father was a
                    great horticulturalist. In fact, he had written books on the subject. Mr. Fenzi
                    had planted an avocado tree there six years ago and we were all amazed how it
                    had grown.</p>
                <p>One evening I was invited to the Sullivan's for cocktails. Mr. Sullivan is the
                    British vice consul here and utterly charming, married to a chic Italian. Miss
                    Whittacker invited me to tea one afternoon when the other guests were the
                    British Consul's wife, Mrs. Barley, Mrs. Sullivan, Mrs. Fenzi, the padre and
                    later Princess Niscemi arrived with her two daughters. I had met her some time
                    ago but she had in the meantime been in America. She was of the wealthy Hersh
                    family of Philadelphia, very intelligent. When I said goodbye, she invited me to
                    cocktails Saturday evening saying she had some American guests come. A cousin of
                    Miss Whittacker, Manfred Whittacker, was also there having just returned from
                    India and brought back 65 paintings he had done there. He lives most of the time
                    in Rome.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Fenzi, who knows everybody, told me an interesting little anecdote about the
                    Niscemi family. Prince Niscemi's mother was lady-in-waiting to the Queen of
                    Italy at one time (she is now the Queen Mother). When the Prince was a young man
                    the Queen of Romania had been invited to stay with them. She did not want to be
                    entertained by the nobility but asked to have the mafia invited. They were
                    invited, but all came heavily armed and were asked to leave their arms below
                    stairs. Then they danced and had a wonderful time.</p>
                <p>The evening of this cocktail party, Lottie and Joe Kyle called to take me to
                    their palace. It was like evoking the times of princely splendor in Sicily as we
                    ascended the long winding marble staircase laid with red carpet. The dining room
                    was decorated with coats of honor and all around the upper walls were paintings
                    of the various kings of Italy. One of the daughters, who was showing us around,
                    pointed out two kings and then added, “and that is the bust of Grandpa Hersh, in
                    the center.” Then we were shown the bed where Lord Nelson had slept and a few
                    more rooms where there were treasures worthy of the Louvre. And then came out
                    onto the terrace where Prince and Princess Niscemi were receiving. When I said,
                    “Good evening Prince Niscemi,” he quickly said in a friendly way, “Call me
                    Conrad,” as he was apparently known to his friends, as a naturalized
                    American.</p>
                <p>Their American guests were Mr. and Mrs. Greenfield from Philadelphia. The Kyles,
                    Slutzes and I were the only ones from the consulate among the 80 guests. The
                    others were mostly titled Italians. I knew a few. I immediately tried to think
                    who I might know in Philadelphia and mentioned my artist friend, Ara Lee Gaul,
                    who had done the sketch for me in Bangkok and Mr. Greenfield said he had known
                    her for a long time and even named the street, Spruce, where she lived.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>One of the Niscemi daughters wore a dress with the new potato sack look and
                    looked like something out of Vogue. I hadn't seen shows for over a year, but
                    here this is the height of fashion. She designs exquisite jewelry and Mrs. Fenzi
                    tells me her mother is furious that she didn't accept a job with Tiffany. Her
                    father took my hand and admiringly showed her the Cavershawn star ruby ring I
                    was wearing that had been made by a Russian and designed with fleur-de-lis and
                    diamonds from my deceased mother's bar pin.</p>
                <p>I read in the Foreign Service Journal, the Norbert Anschutzes had been assigned
                    to Cairo.</p>
                <p>On May 28th I left Palermo by non-stop plane for Rome, then took an express train
                    to the little midget port of Piombino and thence by ferry to Portoferraio, Elba
                    where I went to stay at a small guest house Picchiale, belonging to Colonel
                    Powell West and his wife and recommended by Matilda Sinclair, the social
                    secretary to our Ambassador in Rome. A letter to my sister describes the
                    holiday.</p>
                <p>Elba, May 29, 1958</p>
                <p>Dearest Mildred,</p>
                <p>Well, here I am on this lovely quiet peaceful island of Elba and I love it as I
                    knew I would. When I was at the airport in Palermo, I saw the British vice
                    consul, Mr. Sullivan, who introduced me to Archdean (Inaudible), he was seeing
                    off on my plane. We sat together and had a very pleasant chat. He had come to
                    Palermo at the request of Miss Whittacker to discuss turning the Whittacker
                    chapel over to the diocese as she is the only remaining member of that famous
                    family. He knew, of course, Bishop Rose who was such a comfort to me when Dad
                    died and also old Bishop Chambers at the British embassy church in Paris. He has
                    lived in Florence for years and was returning there. He knew the Countess Biachi
                    where we stayed and Mr. and Mrs. Sutro, friends of Jacqueline Cramer, where I
                    had lunch many years ago. Mr. Sutro had a large key collection and is dead now.
                    Marguerite, his wife, lives in New York.</p>
                <p>I made perfect connections on train and ferry and Colonel West was at
                    Portoferraio to meet me. He looked more English than American, although from
                    Nantucket, and was perfectly delightful, as was his wife. His house was
                    renovated with beautiful taste from a 200 year old farm house set in 30 acres of
                    ground the Germans had left in ruins when they were there to work the iron mines
                    in 1943. I am the only guest at the moment, but today will arrive Matilda
                    Sinclair to see about converting the Norman peasant house above the Wests' and
                    her cousin, Mrs. Arnold, from Brazil, whose house in Trieste, the Auchinclosses
                    by coincidence now occupy. It once belonged to her and was bought by our State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>We had the most interesting conversation over dinner. The Wests are the only
                    Americans living here, but they mentioned Mrs. Simons, American wife of a banker
                    in Beirut and New York, who has bought property here. It is probably Ralph
                    Simons, who was in our National City Bank when we were living in Japan. Others
                    he mentioned were Lord Hastings, who had bought some land from him and will
                    eventually build near. The Duchess of Kent is said to be interested. Also
                    Winston Churchill. They hope, of course, the island will not become too
                    touristy. It is such a quiet charm now. They had staying with them recently
                    Herbert Kubley, author of “Eastern Sicily,” the book you so kindly left for me
                    and is going to have an article on Elba published in Holiday in the fall. Then a
                    Mr. Alexander was there writing an article for the Saturday Evening Post.</p>
                <p>Colonel West has a very brilliant record. His second wife was the daughter of our
                    Ambassador to England, Mr. Davies. Mrs. West had been married to a Darrell from
                    Bermuda. I knew the name well, a great sailing family. And her daughter had gone
                    to Briar Cliff, my alma mater.</p>
                <p>Last evening, when I was asked to sign the guest book, my eyes were immediately
                    attracted to a familiar handwriting, although I had not seen it since my
                    boarding school days. What a thrill to read, Henrietta E. Six. None other than
                    Henrietta Earhart my own Briar Cliff school chum. Her former husband is now
                    married to Ethel Merman. They said that Henrietta was there just a few days ago
                    and had been staying at the Biacchi and now had gone to London. I hope to
                    contact her soon.</p>
                <p>This afternoon going to visit Napoleon's two homes and museum. More later.</p>

                <p>I have nearly 45 minutes to wait for the train so will tell you more about Elba.
                    It really is the loveliest, quietest, more peaceful place. I most certainly
                    could spend a week there. The island spreads out a lot and there are some
                    beautiful beaches with villas clustered around them, with picturesque towns
                    higher on the mountains. I have become delirious about the scenery and steeped
                    in Napoleonic lore. You know I have always been especially fascinated by the
                    Napoleonic isles. I will be off to St. Helena, next. Napoleon's brief visit to
                    Elba was one moment of historical glory. He ruled for little less than 10 months
                    with a hundred grenadiers and a naval force consisting of one brig. He
                    captivated everyone with his knowledge of his exile kingdom and lavished his
                    administrative genius which had previously organized a huge empire. He accepted
                    his exile on one condition, that his wife and son would join him, but he waited
                    in vain. Empress Marie Louise was busy with General Neipperg, who she later
                    married and the Emperor of Austria held his son, his own grandson, King of Rome,
                    a prisoner in Vienna. The only women who did come were his mother, Letizia, and
                    the young Countess Waluwaska. Other visitors were Napoleon's illegitimate son
                    who left after two days and his beautiful and scandalous sister, Pauline
                    Borghesia, who arrived to head his court in the modest Villa Mulini. On the
                    night she was to give one of her gay parties, her brief apology was, “canceled
                    by destiny.” It was in February, 1815 when Napoleon slipped away on the
                    Inconstant, passed the British warship, went to Paris to be crowned the second
                    time.</p>
                <p>On this island of Elba one became conscious of golden bees, imperial eagles and
                    the letter N. His country villa at San Martino, 2 miles from Portoferraio, is
                    simple, small, infinitely touching like his birth place in Ajaccio, Corsica, the
                    island one could see lying on the horizon. On the ceiling of the salon were
                    painted sentimental symbols of the Empress and himself, a pair of doves tying
                    lover's knots with blue ribbons in their beaks. I learned for the first time
                    that Napoleon's only novel was Clissona et Eugenie, an autobiographical love
                    story. The occasional pieces of original furniture were covered in the same blue
                    he loved. A little Egyptian room tenderly intended, one supposed, to be a
                    comforting memory of passed glories to a repenting tyrant. After a visit to
                    Napoleon's houses there were no more monuments to see to nag one into activity.
                    It was just like Napoleon once referred to it, “his isle of rest.”</p>
                <p>Delia Whittacker had given me a note of introduction to her cousin, Hugh
                    Whittacker, an elderly man I was told imbued with spiritualism. He was not at
                    home when I called, but I met his administrator who invited me in to his tiny
                    apartment for a drink near the Whittacker's famous hotel Fonte Napoleone in
                    Poggio, where the guest book included signatures of the Duke and Duchess of
                    Windsor. I regretted I did not have time to look up the British Consul's wartime
                    friend, Major Robinson.</p>
                <p>When I sailed from Portoferraio this morning at 7:00, I could see for many miles
                    out to sea the Wests' precious pink house perched on the side of the hill. It
                    really had been an ideal place for a peaceful holiday. The train is leaving now
                    so must close.</p>
                <p>Love Virginia</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>As soon as I returned from Elba, I plunged in for preparations for a cocktail
                    party I was having on my upstairs terrace. The dim colored lights from my
                    Moroccan hanging lamps cast a soft glow on the faded ancient tiles and the
                    Bangkok temple bells tingled in the breeze. Princess Niscemi was the first to
                    arrive and raved about the ambiance. I felt very flattered as it was such a far
                    cry from her own palatial home.</p>
                <p>A few nights later the Duke d'Belsito and his wife called to take me to the
                    Niscemis for dinner. It was in honor of a Mr. Mund from Seattle, Washington, and
                    his pretty new bride, who were returning to the States aboard the Ile de France.
                    As we entered that romantic old palace, the Duke looked around and said to me,
                    “You know my mother was born in this palace. She was the sister of Prince
                    Niscemi's father.</p>
                <p>Among the other guests was the charming Italian, Mr. De Lucce, director of the
                    American Express. At dinner I was seated to the left of Prince Niscemi and
                    during the course of conversation he mentioned his place in Hyannis Port. So I
                    ask if he knew the Joseph P. Kennedys and, of course, he did, very well. I told
                    him how fascinated Mrs. Kennedy was with the little Sicilian carts and had asked
                    me to send her one for her grandchildren's collection. He said he was going
                    there in September and kindly offered to take it to her. But I thanked him and
                    said it had already been posted. He also knew my brother-in-law's relative,
                    Edgar (Inaudible).</p>
                <p>It was a beautiful dinner, but unfortunately, during one of the courses, the
                    pasta slipped from my fork and fell on the front of my blue Thai silk dress.
                    When the Prince saw me struggling to wipe it off, with typical Italian gallantry
                    he reached for his white carnation, that had also been given to all the men for
                    their buttonholes, and gently tucked it in my bodice covering this spot and my
                    embarrassment. Needless to say, I was touched and grateful.</p>
                <p>When we left all of the ladies were presented with tiny bouquets of pink roses
                    and jasmine. It had been an unforgettable evening.</p>
                <p>A note from London arrived from Henrietta Earhart, my dear Briar Cliff boarding
                    school friend. I had lost touch with her over the years and really didn't know
                    if she was still alive.</p>
                <p>“I can't tell you how completely amazed and delighted I was to receive your
                    letter a few days ago. Leora Biachi forwarded it on here where I have taken a
                    tiny flat for a couple of months. I think you were so clever to notice my name
                    in the West book. That is a charming place, isn't it. What an interesting career
                    you have chosen for yourself and how I wish I could have done such a thing
                    instead of wasting my time in such an aimless way. If you find that a trip to
                    London is in the offing, do try and make it before I leave here. We can spend a
                    lot of time catching up for the last 25 years.”</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>What a wave of memories washed over me as I read it, of the happy times we had
                    together at Briar Cliff and vacations spent with her delightful mother and
                    father in their beautiful 5th Avenue apartment. She was an elegant little girl
                    of privilege.</p>
                <p>Also came a card from Audrey Auchincloss saying that they are going on home leave
                    in October and booked on the Saturnia leaving Trieste on October 3 and will come
                    via Palermo and hope to have a glimpse of me there. I was, of course, thrilled
                    at the thought of seeing them again.</p>
                <p>Also came a charming letter from Mrs. Kennedy thanking me for the Sicilian cart
                    dated June 11, 1958 from Hyannis Port.</p>
                <p>“Dear Mrs. Biddle,</p>
                <p>The little donkey cart arrived Mary 23 and was greeted with exclamations of
                    delight and admiration on every side. Thank you very much for your efforts in
                    selecting the adorable toy. I do hope that all goes well with you. We shall be
                    at Eden Rock on the French Riviera during the month of August, and if you are
                    near, please contact us. My deepest appreciation always. Very sincerely yours,
                    Rose Kennedy.”</p>
                <p>On July 9, I wrote my sister from Sardinia where I had gone for the July 4th
                    weekend. Jolly Hotel, Cagliari, Sardinia, July 9, 1958.</p>
                <p>From the moment I stepped off the ship last Friday we have been on the move, but
                    I could not go to bed tonight knowing the date, our dear Father's birthday,
                    without writing to you for I know what must be in your heart too, today, my
                    dear.</p>
                <p>The weather has been pleasant, sometimes hot, but not unbearable. There are six
                    Italians and one other American in the group taking the tour around the island.
                    This is an island of primitive, unspoiled beauty. The scenery is most dramatic.
                    Tall, spiny, reddish mauve rocks rise above green valleys, undiscovered beaches,
                    deserted, rugged, solitude. Some of it peopled only by shepherds. Eagles glide
                    silently above the mountains. Human life is glimpsed only briefly. It certainly
                    looks like bandit country. As D.H. Lawrence wrote in his book, “Sea and
                    Sardinia,” “After spending six days here, from February 4-10, 1921, Sardinia is
                    an island lost between Europe and Africa belonging to nowhere.”</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>It is indeed like nowhere. It is a blessed wilderness. The people are essentially
                    reserved and introspective and seem becalmed in the past. The women are
                    ferociously beautiful with straight queenly backs. Then their pleated skirts
                    flap at their ankles and their heads are tied with kerchiefs, one end drawn
                    across the mouth. They weave baskets from the tall stalks of the asphodel plant
                    whose blossom are like pale stars and dot the hillside. And they make rugs on
                    hand looms from wool of their own sheep, must sort after. Then saddlebags of
                    beautifully woven and patterns of the characteristic Sardinian colors, rust
                    brown, lemon yellow and pink. They say the Sardinians are probably the most
                    skilled peasant artisans in the Mediterranean. The men, the few and old that are
                    left, are dressed all in black and white like magpies. White drawers, great
                    white sleeves, black waistcoats and gaiters and black stocking cap whose hanging
                    ends bobs like a top. A tassel in the back is called a berrette. With their
                    remote stares, mounted on the tiniest donkeys I have ever seen, and believe
                    exist in the world, they look like Cyclops.</p>
                <p>What appealed to me most were the Pisan Romanesque churches, black and white
                    basilicas which we came across all over the island. How wonderfully the Pisans
                    made use of the romantic wildness of the landscape by building on remote crags
                    completely isolated and their austere beauty so perfectly suited the Sardinian
                    characters. Few countries have an ecclesiastical architecture which blends so
                    strikingly into the landscape. What intrigued me most were the “nuraghi,”
                    curious remains in various stages of ruins, overgrown with weeds and briars
                    scattered about the island. They were crumbling cone shaped forts rising like
                    derelict castles from the prehistoric period. There is no evidence of mortar so
                    they were supported heaven knows how. They could have served as a refuge for
                    tribes and chieftains, shelter for herds, used as granaries or any number of
                    other things. Nobody seems to agree about their meaning for few reference works
                    exist and authorities are constantly contradicting one another. But it is their
                    unfathomable mystery that is one of their great charms.</p>
                <p>As we drove around the island we noticed every house we passed bore its DDT spray
                    date in scrolled in black letters like a vaccination, a joyful attestation of
                    immunity from malaria. For centuries throughout the whole of Sardinia, malaria
                    worked its way through generations of Sardinians leaving them sick and inert
                    until 1945 when American doctors subsidized by the Rockefeller Foundation set to
                    work and completely eradicated it by 1952.</p>
                <p>We spent a night in the Jolly Hotel in the hill village of Nuoro and heard we
                    were the first Americans that had come there. A stupendous view could be had of
                    Mt. Ortoben</p>
                <p>which towered above Nuoro. Saved by tourism by its inaccessibleness it was the
                    birth place of Grazia Deledda, who won a Nobel Prize in 1926. She wrote
                    fictional romances and her novels were interwoven with unusual anecdotes and a
                    great deal of untapped and fascinating local history which gave Sardinia a place
                    in literary.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>Cagliare, the capital, had a museum housing a most important collection of
                    bronzes, skillfully wrought and designed with artistry showing how highly
                    developed was their civilization. It was in the prehistoric period Sardinia
                    gained its greatest influence.</p>
                <p>Alghero, the walled harbor, with its towers and bastions, looking like a
                    transplanted port of Morocco or Spain, was a popular bathing resort on the sea,
                    and the most cosmopolitan town we visited. I learned that the coral that Naples
                    sells comes from this place and is bought there. Here we stayed in a CSIT hotel,
                    a group of these unpretentious, yet attractive government hotels, like the
                    Jolly, made remote, wonderful stopovers possible.</p>
                <p>We took a small boat from Palau, little more than a stone jetty, to the island of
                    Maddalena, where we stayed two night and from there drove across the stone
                    causeway to the tiny island of Caprera, where we visited Garibaldi's home, now a
                    museum. Maddalena, lying between Corsica and Sardinia had a scrubbed look that
                    comes from being a naval base and is responsible for the beautiful upkeep of the
                    museum and the gardens of the island estate, Casa Bionca. Giuseppe Garibaldi,
                    the hero of Italian unification, was born July 4, 1807 at Nice, which was then
                    Italian. He retired here in 1955 at the age of 48 after his fighting days were
                    over and tortured by rheumatism to write a novel. The high point in his career
                    came in May, 1860 when he landed with his red-skirted army of a thousand to
                    liberate all of Sicily, Southern Italy and defeated the Napoleon force. A
                    daughter, 94, still lives in a part of the original home. The rooms are kept
                    just as he left them, with revered objects even the saddle of his horse,
                    Marsala, named after the landing place of the thousand. Hanging on the wall was
                    a calendar bearing the date, June 2, 1882, the day of his death. We walked down
                    a neat gravel drive to his granite tomb flanked by those of his wife and
                    children, under olive trees and among rich clusters of geraniums. It all had
                    great charm and dignity. For an intelligent traveler it is a rewarding island.
                    Love Virginia</p>
                <p>Twenty years later, while writing this chapter in Bendenot on the island of
                    Majorca, I met one person, Prince Gilles di Poliolo, cousin of the former King
                    of Italy, who did not agree that Garibaldi was a hero because he told me that
                    his grandfather and many of the nobility preferred Sicily to remain an
                    independent kingdom and did not want to become part of Italy. But, when they
                    rebelled, Garibaldi confiscated their land and striped them of their titles so
                    they fled to France, where he was born.</p>
                <p>After I arrived back from Sardinia, things began to happen. The minute I got home
                    a note came from Lottie Kyle saying they were giving a dinner that evening for
                    the Memmingers, who had just arrived from Naples. He is the Supervising Consul
                    General at the embassy in Rome. So went to the hairdresser and had my hair cut
                    and permed and felt marvelous. Margaret Hussman gave a cocktail party for them
                    and included the new German Consul and his wife, British Consul and vice consul,
                    and wives, and new Panamanian Consul and Prince and Princess Niscemi, and some
                    others. And I am entertaining them on Sunday evening.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>Mr. Memminger and I began to talk about Bangkok and he told me he had relieved
                    Norbert Anschutz in Athens when he went there and was a great friend of
                    Ambassador Peurifoy. So I told him all about his terrible tragedy and showed him
                    photos of the funeral and of the Anschutzes when they departed Bangkok. Then he
                    noticed my autographed photograph of President Truman and exclaimed, “Oh, I see
                    you have a photo of Harry.” I explained the Trumans had been friends of the
                    family for some time and they had always been very nice to me.</p>
                <p>I was terribly happy to have the good news that I had been promoted to class
                    FSS-11 and had waited so long for this decided to celebrate by giving a party
                    for the entire visa section, locals and Americans, about 50, including spouses.
                    They all came, even the Consul's chauffeur, Luigi and his dear little wife.
                    Marcelle L'Conte sent me a congratulatory note from the Embassy in Paris which
                    was a pleasant surprise.</p>
                <p>At a cocktail party at the Niscemis I met Miss Jebb, whose father was British
                    Ambassador at Paris. A sweet young girl who said she was on French Vogue.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Kennedy wrote on June 6, 1958 that the grandchildren were all so delighted
                    with the little Sicilian cart, would I please sent another addressed to her
                    daughter, Mrs. Sargent Shriver in Chicago. So, I did with pleasure.</p>
                <p>On July 22 there was a staff meeting announcing that all local leaves had been
                    canceled until further notice. Three hundred people were being evacuated to Rome
                    from the Near East, due to the Suez situation. A few days later on a Saturday
                    afternoon, Joe Kyle came to see me to say he had just received a call from Mr.
                    Waterman in the personnel section in the embassy in Rome requesting that one
                    American be sent over to assist them with the evacuation. So, I was the one
                    selected to go and must leave Sunday evening by plane in order to report for
                    work on Monday morning. The maximum time there would be for two months. So I
                    hurriedly packed. “Flying Rome Sunday evening, detailed embassy two months,
                    assist Near East evacuation, inform Charlie, writing, Love V.” was my cable to
                    my sister.</p>
                <p>Our embassy in Rome fronts the famous Via Veneto, a historic building on a
                    historic site, once known as Palaco Margarette for Margarette Disaboiy, the
                    first Queen of Italy who once owned it. When I approached it Monday morning it
                    looked like a day nursery. There masses of children of all ages, sizes and sex
                    and their fond Mommies swarming around, the newly setup evacuation office to the
                    right. I thought, “Well, this is it.” I was assigned to Mr. Rosenthal and my
                    particular job was to type messages, run them off on the hecto and route them.
                    The code room was air-conditioned and all were on continuous alert duty. Code
                    clerks stayed at post 24 hours at a time undertaking the arduous, delicate task
                    of decoding urgent, Top Secret telegrams, long and complicated. My hours were
                    from 4:00 to midnight.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>At first the hours were a bit of a shock, but really didn't mind because it gave
                    me the day free to look for a place to stay. All the hotels around the embassy
                    were fully booked with tourists and evacuees. Rome was seething with Americans
                    and one heard more English than Italian and one wondered who was at home.
                    Matilda Sinclair very kindly suggested going out to Pairoli, the lovely
                    residential section where she lived. And, I did see a charming little hotel, the
                    Rivioli. Each room with a terrace and they had an excellent lunch there. But
                    they were fully booked. I finally found the perfect place, a pension just a few
                    minutes from the embassy called La Residenza. It was beautifully furnished and
                    the bathroom covered with 16th century tiles. It had been recommended by the
                    embassy and the guide I had in Rome several years ago, Lea Lelli, who had
                    invited me to dinner one evening. Eleanor Roosevelt had written in her column,
                    “Eleanor Roosevelt Day,” headed “The Countess Knows Her Home. On Friday, March
                    13, in Rome, my granddaughter, Nina, and I went out at 9:00 with Countess Lea
                    Lelli, the most interesting guide one could have. She describes the history of
                    Rome as if she had lived through each century and experienced each conquest and
                    I can think of no one who could have given me a more interesting bird's eye view
                    of the city as a group on different hills.” This is all too true.</p>
                <p>In the evening I dined with her and she gave me a list of recent archaeological
                    discoveries to see here and I would have loved chatting with her longer, but had
                    to get on to the Memmingers' party. She introduced me to her secretary, a young
                    attractive American girl, Miss Rippel. It was the only evening she could see me
                    because she was leaving for the Dolomites and would be gone a month, and gave me
                    her address if I should come that way.</p>
                <p>Just as I went into the Memmingers' party, Mrs. Jernigan arrived and said she had
                    just seen the Ambassador off to the airport for his month's holiday. So that
                    meant that her husband was now Charg�. I was delighted to see Margaret Hussman
                    who had come over from Palermo for the visa conference and returning early the
                    next morning. I was so pleased to see Mrs. Fritzlan, the nice English wife of
                    David. They had been so nice to me when I had arrived at the legation in
                    Tangier. But the poor dear said she was on holiday in Jerusalem with her
                    two-year old son and now pregnant with another child and English nurse, when she
                    received the news from her husband, who is now Charg� in Baghdad, to evacuate
                    and left from Jerusalem and never returned to Baghdad again to see him.</p>
                <p>I was beginning to gather bits of news here and there from various people about
                    their experiences. When I thanked Mr. Memminger for the lovely party on leaving
                    and mentioned what an attractive apartment they had, he said, “I will trade it
                    for your little house any day.” “All right, that would suit me beautifully,” I
                    said.</p>
                <p>Margaret asked me to go to dinner afterwards and we went to a trattoria in a
                    pretty little piazza where a fountain was playing and the moon rose over an old
                    church.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>My hours were eventually changed. I was now working from 8:30am to any old hour,
                    but get paid for overtime, and was pleased because I was now on the heart of
                    things. My job was to go out to the airport when flights came in, check the
                    passports of the evacuees, assign them to their respective hotels, then come
                    back to the embassy and type the list of arrivals to send to the Department.
                    Among the refugees were many pregnant women who had to be sent on to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>It is quite exciting watching the planes soaring in and out bringing the evacuees
                    to safe haven Rome as it is called here. The chartered flights had been doing an
                    airlift surpassing that of the Berlin one. Mr. Rosenthal gives a briefing in the
                    embassy theater to every plane load that arrives. And when I listened I marveled
                    at the wonderful organization, coordination of everything. Facilities were made
                    for the children to play at the playgrounds of the embassy while the American
                    officers' wives took their Mums to look for apartments. Always there were
                    enormous buses drawn up in front of the embassy loaded with children to take
                    them to a beach club. There was a wonderful cartoon in nearly every office in
                    the embassy of an American family showing films to their friends of a
                    demonstration abroad and the caption underneath it read, “An we took refuge in
                    so many embassies our savings and hotel bills were simply fantastic!”</p>
                <p>I kept meeting people I had known before. One day a woman came into the office to
                    see Mr. Rosenthal, the evacuation officer, who was young, very nice and easy to
                    work for. We both stared at each other and finally realized we knew each other
                    in Bangkok where her husband had been with USIS and later transferred to
                    Baghdad. She then asked me to come to her hotel for a drink that evening and I
                    was eager to hear all about what happened in Iraq. She told me haltingly,
                    looking away with tears nearly coming to her eyes, about the panicky exodus. She
                    said it all happened quite suddenly, but felt a coup would come some time. They
                    attacked the British embassy first and then burned their USIS. The Iraqis seemed
                    to want to keep friends with the Americans and have cooperated very well. She
                    planned to go to a resort on the Adriatic coast.</p>
                <p>The next hot spot mentioned is Tripoli. Then they expect to evacuee Amman and
                    Beirut.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>Staying in my hotel was Mrs. Gallman, the wife to our Ambassador to Baghdad with
                    her two sons, the older one from Yale, the younger one from Berkshires. They had
                    just come out in June to be with their parents for the summer holidays and only
                    there a month when evacuated. They asked me to join them for dinner one evening
                    and we had a very interesting conversation. A telegram was received from her
                    husband in the embassy so touching I showed it to Mrs. Gallman and could see
                    tears in her eyes as she read it, as they were in mine when I first read it, for
                    it was such a tribute. “Messages are now coming back to us from our evacuees.
                    Overtone of all is one of highest regard and friendly reception on arrival Rome
                    and for smooth, intelligent handling of hotel accommodations followed by
                    availability of all essential means to facilitate adjustment to temporary life
                    in Italy. As I put these messages from our evacuees together, I get a clear
                    picture not only about staffing, planning, administrative and executive skills,
                    but the warm understanding appreciation of the hundred and one things that would
                    trouble and preoccupy our wives and dependents. From their husbands and fathers
                    in Baghdad, deepest gratitude. Gallman.” He later became Director of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>On August 1 it was so frightfully hot one became almost stupefied and the embassy
                    closed in the afternoon. I stayed in the office to allow Mr. Rosenthal to take
                    the afternoon off. He had been at this since June 26 and was doing a very good
                    job on this evacuation program, but was beginning to get awfully tired, and the
                    heat, of course, has been most debilitating. It was just like Bangkok weather,
                    but one cannot dress exactly like Bangkok, unfortunately, because Rome is a
                    sophisticated city. I only hope they continue to keep me busy so I can stay on
                    here. I feel I have been given a wonderful opportunity and I am making the most
                    of it in every way.</p>
                <p>The Jernigans gave a cocktail party in their garden for 500 of the evacuees. I
                    recalled under these gardens were once catacombs where Christians took refugee
                    from the Romans, and heard that Ambassador Zellerbach, a wine connoisseur, tried
                    to keep his wine there but it didn't work. It was too cold and too damp.</p>
                <p>In chatting with the Memmingers, I like so much, Mr. Memminger said if I could
                    not get home for Christmas I could spend Christmas with them in Rome. Then Mrs.
                    Memminger said, “I think you should get transferred to Rome.” Of course, that
                    was what I was trying to do. I overheard Mr. Rosenthal tell Mr. Memminger that I
                    was doing a wonderful job, which was music to my ears.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the evening I met a Mrs. Simmons, whose husband was with MAAG,
                    who invited me to their place for a swim and supper Sunday evening. They lived
                    some distance from Rome in a new section of enormous modern apartments which
                    surrounded a beautiful swimming pool and tennis courts. From the terrace of
                    their fifth floor apartment we had a gorgeous view of Rome with St. Peters
                    towering above all.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>One of the other guests was an American, Miss McFarland, who lived in Chevy
                    Chase, just outside Washington and whose father was in the Navy. Mr. Waterman,
                    chief of personnel at the embassy, who lived just below, joined us for a drink.
                    They spoke of the famous Palio in Siena that was being held this Saturday. It
                    takes place twice a year and attracts thousands from all over the world and
                    something I had always wanted to see. Although it was late to get tickets I
                    began to try for Ruth Clark, Mr. Memminger's secretary, said she would go with
                    me.</p>
                <p>Mr. Martelli who had been so obliging at the CIAT office in Palermo called their
                    office in Florence and got two very good seats for us. It had seemed hopeless
                    because the embassy said they were all sold out in Rome. But, I waited until the
                    last minute to pick them up because if something came in on the evacuees I
                    couldn't have gone. But luckily nothing came in.</p>
                <p>We took the most marvelous, deluxe, all air-conditioned, supper rapido for
                    Florence. Then taxied to a pension for which I had the greatest affection and it
                    was nice to have (Inaudible) at the desk say, “Yes, I remember you,” having been
                    there just last September with my sister. We had been given the most enormous
                    room with a beautiful view over the campanile and Duomo from our window. Later
                    in the cool of the evening walked up to see the Duomo and thrilled to see that
                    the scaffolding, Mildred and I had seen around the campanile had been removed
                    and it had been beautifully cleaned. Then we walked down to the Arno and stood
                    on the San Trinita bridge and looked over towards the Ponte Vecchio. I remember
                    so well when here in 1947, everyone lamented that the Trinita, the most
                    beautiful bridge of all had been bombed. Then they planned to rebuild it just as
                    it was and to see that it had been accomplished was another thrill. We had a
                    delicious dinner at Santini.</p>
                <p>The bus picked us up early the next morning to take us to Siena via San Gimignano
                    where we had lunch after seeing the little town with its many towers rising into
                    the glorious sky of Tuscany. We arrived in Siena in the heart of Italy's
                    Chianti's country and one of Europe's perfectly preserved medieval towns, about
                    2:30pm. It was just about an hour's drive from San Gimignano.</p>
                <p>We had perfectly wonderful seats right in the second row in front of the starting
                    place where they let the ropes down for that made race. The race lasts less than
                    two minutes but the parade goes on for two hours. The setting alone was enough
                    to thrill one. The beautiful Piazza de Campo where the Palio is performed looked
                    like an immense basket of flowers. Ancient mansions stand all around it and most
                    beautiful of all is the town hall with its graceful lofty tower called Tour del
                    Mangia. Byron said it was “the noblest town in Italy.” The balconies were
                    decorated with red velvet bunting and flags of all colors were flapping
                    everywhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>The bell in the tower tolled out to announce the procession. A historical
                    pageant, an allegorical parade. Silver bugles and drums played the traditional
                    march of the Palio. Bells tolled from all of the churches and the Mangia tower.
                    The participants are dressed in colorful medieval costumes. One of the
                    highlights of the Palio are the expert manipulators of the contrade (district
                    banners), a flag twirling game. Two men stop just in front of our box and to the
                    beat of the drum, cleverly twisted and turned their large banners around their
                    bodies and between their legs. Then toss them high in the air. As each flag
                    starts to descend the folds gracefully unfurl against the blue sky and before it
                    touches the ground it is skillfully caught only with the left hand while he
                    salutes with his right to the delight and applause of the crowd.</p>
                <p>Then came the horseback riders bearing the colors of the contrade. Each group
                    seems to have been selected from the animal kingdom. Paradoxically enough, the
                    snail contrade was winner of a recent Palio. The wildly excited horses unleashed
                    extraordinary emotion in the race. The rider who started off first kept ahead
                    the entire time until he made the last difficult turn when he fell off, but his
                    horse kept going and won the race.</p>
                <p>With the sun setting and the swallows flying over the tall tower and medieval
                    palaces with their gay red velvet hangings, it had been a spectacle to
                    behold.</p>
                <p>When I reached Rome, I went to the train at midnight to meet an evacuee from
                    Amman. She had known the Peurifoys when posted in Greece, so we immediately
                    formed a mutual admiration society. I had to give up my room while gone, but
                    luckily was given another, the guest room of the proprietor on the very top
                    floor. It was air conditioned and quiet, but the telephone was down on the next
                    floor. The Residenza is so crowded. Poor Mrs. Dorsey and her daughters, evacuees
                    from Beirut, where her husband was director of USIS, had to move out. She was
                    most attractive and lived just a block from my sister in Georgetown. Her two
                    daughters were very accomplished. Caroline, the older, and Charolette the
                    younger modeled for Pouchi.</p>
                <p>After communion on Sundays I would often go to a little English tearoom I found
                    at the foot of the Spanish Steps named for the 17th century residence of the
                    Spanish Ambassador to the Vatican and decorated by a sunken large fountain by
                    Bernini, in quiet surroundings where I could have a real American breakfast of
                    orange juice, waffles, crispy bacon with hot American coffee. It was the
                    Babbington Tea Room and faced the Keats Shelley house, where later I would
                    browse over all of their mementoes in a tiny room where he died at the age of 26
                    with the famous painter Joseph Severn beside him.Later I visited the Protestant
                    cemetery where they were buried. (I always had an insatiable desire to see where
                    famous people were buried.)</p>
                <p>The next evening I went with Gabrielle Metcalfe and her mother, now posted in
                    Rome, to hear “La Traviata” in the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla. It is
                    considered to have the largest stage in the world. It was a wonderful experience
                    sitting in those 1700 year old ruins and listening to the most lovely voices
                    from this charming opera. It was so chilly during the intermission that hot
                    coffee with brandy was passed around in bottles with straws.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>I was so glad to discover so much of Rome could be seen by night when it was cool
                    and I was free. One evening I wondered through the Baths of Diocletian, through
                    the museum alone with my guide books thoroughly enjoying myself. It was heavenly
                    to stroll under a full moon through the gardens designed by Michelangelo where a
                    fountain was playing, goldfish swimming, surrounded by the cloisters of the
                    monks. To know Rome at all, you must feel it, then only will you begin to see
                    it.</p>
                <p>Another evening I took the CIT tour to Tivoli where the fabulous fountains of the
                    Villa D'Este were illuminated and it was romantic beyond words wondering in
                    those Renaissance gardens. At one time the composer Liszt lived there and wrote,
                    “The Fountains of Villa D'Este.”</p>
                <p>After a late breakfast one Sunday at my favorite Babbington Tea Room, all I
                    wanted to do was to find a cool spot and read a book as it had been 2:00am when
                    I left the embassy after typing the list of evacuees. We had reached the
                    thousand and one mark by now, but the refugee exodus was far from over. So, I
                    walked up to the Borghese Gardens, sat down for a while to enjoy the magnificent
                    panorama of Rome, bathed in the hot afternoon sun. Then remembered that I had
                    heard of a charming restaurant, Casino Baladier in the Pincian Hills, but as it
                    was 4:00pm the solitary waiter was resting his head on the table and there was
                    not a soul on the terrace. So I just had a gin and tonic and a bag of potato
                    chips, who had aroused himself to serve me, about the history of the place. He
                    brought me a card with the explanation. It had been originally built for the
                    King of Rome, the unhappy Aiglain, which interested me very much as I had
                    followed Napoleon's family from France to Corsica to Elba and now here.</p>
                <p>I returned another day to visit the Borghese museum where the aura of the
                    Princess Borghese, the ravishing sister of Napoleon, Pauline Bonaparte, was
                    potent still. Marvelous works of sculpture by Bernini. One I loved was of Apollo
                    and Daphne as she was being turned into a tree, done when he was only 18. There
                    were also wonderful painting by Del Sarto, Titian and many others.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>I had read in a good little book called Roamin the palace of the president could
                    be visited on Thursdays and suddenly remembered that an Italian I had known in
                    our USIS office in Palermo was now a protocol officer to the president. So I
                    rang him and he met me at the palace gates when my taxi drew up and kissed my
                    hand while all the guards and flunkies around saluted him. An attractive
                    gentleman in the thirties and it was so nice to have this personally conducted
                    tour. There were such beautiful rooms, each done in different colors and
                    appropriately named the Japanese Room, the Gold Room, the Blue Room, etc. As we
                    looked out of the window at the gardens below, Serge said, “That is where the
                    receptions are held in the summer and white swans are added to the pools when a
                    party is given.” It had formerly been the summer home for the Popes and served
                    as a royal palace after 1870 and now the home of the president. Serge said he
                    could live in the palace if he wanted to but preferred not to as he would have
                    to pass the guards every time he came and went with guests. So he had more
                    privacy living apart. He thought it was the most beautiful palace he had seen in
                    Europe, mentioning the ones in Sweden and England. The candelabras were enormous
                    made of Bohemia crystal, beautiful marble topped tables, rare marble
                    mantelpieces. One of the eleven of ceilings were beautiful paintings.</p>
                <p>When we finished the tour and walked toward the gate, the changing of the guard
                    was just about to take place and we could hear the beat of the drums and the
                    band approaching from outside. As a special favor they allowed me to see it from
                    inside the palace while all of the others had to wait outside. The glorious
                    picturesque guards with their shiny helmets, long horse tails falling from them
                    down their backs, bright swords held in their white-gloved hands, white coats
                    with blue trousers and red stripes, added a touch of the old monarchy to the
                    palace. I came away feeling like Cinderella.</p>
                <p>One noon, Mr. Rosenthal said I could take a longer lunch hour if I wished. So I
                    dashed over to the Fontana Sisters near the Spanish Steps, just to get an idea
                    of what sort of cocktail dresses they were showing. But the most interesting
                    thing I saw was a perfectly enormous autographed photograph of Margaret Truman
                    and her husband in her wedding dress they had designed.</p>
                <p>On September 2, I received a letter from my Swiss friend, Jacqueline Cramer
                    saying: “I am leaving September 1 for Ischia where I shall take the cure until
                    the 20th and will stay in care of Duke Cameening l'Algarada, Porto Ischia. It
                    would be great fun if you could come over, fly over, sail over, swim over, some
                    day.” I answered by saying that she probably remembers that I had been longing
                    to come to Ischia for ages and hoped to get there before she leaves. I still
                    don't know when I can leave. Mr. Rosenthal said they must have someone cleared
                    for classified material, so that is the reason I am not be so really replaced.
                    But, I hope they find someone soon because I don't wait too late to go to the
                    lakes and find them frozen over. We already have had a few down pours.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>One Sunday I took a bus with several others to see Hadrian's famous Rock Villa,
                    especially interesting to me because the exquisite mosaics in the president's
                    palace came from there. In the afternoon I made a tour of the Castella Romani,
                    the Roman castle, situated on the Albani Hills. Tiny villages each with it
                    peculiar charm. Our first stop was at Frascati where the famous white wine of
                    Italy is made, to An Ariccia and then on to Genzano, arriving about 6:00 in the
                    evening at Castel Gandolfo, a pretty little village on Lake Albano, the Pope's
                    summer palace, where I heard we were going to see the Pope. I quickly bought two
                    rosaries to be blessed as we walked up the hill with hundreds of others. We
                    passed inside the gates where the guards were standing on either side carrying
                    their medieval swords bearing jaunty black tams on their heads and in their gay
                    uniforms that haven't changed since the 14th century. There must have been about
                    3,000 in the courtyard. When the Pope appeared all in white, such a cheer went
                    up. An Italian girl kept shouting, “Vita, vita,” which meant “long live the
                    Pope.” An American standing beside me kept repeating, “Oh, Holy Father, Oh, Holy
                    Father.” And another behind me was heard to say, “Look at his beautiful hands,”
                    as he blessed the crowd over and over again. After 15 minutes the door of his
                    room was opened and he disappeared. It was a wonderful and most unexpected
                    experience. He was Pope Pius XII, now 84 years old. The one with whom I had a
                    private audience with Mildred and Charlie in 1934 was Pope Pius XI.</p>
                <p>When I returned to the La Residenza, I found a message that the consulate in
                    Venice called to say a Mrs. Wright, with her son and mother, would be arriving
                    in the morning on the 7:23 train. The embassy car picked me up at 6:00am and I
                    discovered she was the wife of the Charg� in Amman. When she heard I was from
                    Palermo, immediately mentioned what a good job Mr. Keeley's son was doing, who
                    had just arrived there.</p>
                <p>Mr. Rosenthal announced on September 4 that the security needed our office as it
                    was theirs originally and he was going back to his old job of management. So, my
                    tour of duty would be over as of Monday evening. I plan to leave Tuesday morning
                    for Milan and the Lakes and then on to Verona, Padua and Ravenna and hoped to
                    get up to the smallest republic in the world, San Marino. Then back to Rome and
                    take the train to Naples and go over to Ischia for a few days and visit with
                    Jacqueline Cramer before taking the postali back to Palermo.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Fenzi had come over to Rome to see her daughter for a few days and it was
                    good to see her and have news from there. I had experienced one prolonged
                    interesting break in the routine of office work in Palermo, but also looked
                    forward to returning to my little house and garden and Pena.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>The next morning I left on that super duper train to Milan, the same one Ruth
                    Clark and I had taken to Florence. The trip to the Lakes was delightful. First
                    went to Lake Maggiore and never have I seen such enormous dahlias in the garden
                    and I had a delicious lunch of trout from the lake at the Regina Hotel in
                    Stresa. We crossed over to Isolobella and it lives up to its name that was
                    chosen to honor Isabella, Countess Borronio. It was Count Vitaliano Borronio who
                    made it into a luxurious residence in the 17th century. It had originally been
                    just a flat rock with a church and a few cottages. (Later at Ischia, Jacqueline
                    told me she almost married one of the Borronio family.) Now the huge palace is a
                    richly furnished museum. Then on to Lake Como which sparkled like a
                    three-pointed star and had tea at a hotel where I should love to return and stay
                    one day, the Villa D'Este. It was so beautiful and so romantic. At Lake Garda, I
                    heard it was the only lake that was not misty.</p>
                <p>The next morning I was off on another bus tour to Verona with the courtyard of
                    Juliet's balcony is still imbued with romance, and on to Padua where I learned
                    that St. Anthony of Padua was neither a Paduan nor even an Italian. He was born
                    in Lisbon in 1195 and christened Ferdinand, but inspired such love among so many
                    that the Paduans erected in his honor one of the most sublime basilicas in
                    Christendom and I found it more impressive than ever because of Donatello's
                    celebrated sculptures and exquisite frescos. We stayed at the only first-class
                    hotel in town, the Storione. It couldn't have been much older and still been
                    considered first-class, but I loved it.</p>
                <p>The next morning I dashed to a church to see some marvelous mosaics and became so
                    enthralled and missed my bus to San Marino, but fortunately there was another
                    one at noon, a local one that stopped at several little villages. When people
                    got off they were carrying all kinds of funny things. One woman threw a mattress
                    over her shoulder and carried it like this as she walked up one of the
                    hills.</p>
                <p>Although San Marino is a republic, it is like a toy kingdom situated on very
                    steep hills with gorgeous view. I had an excellent lunch at the hotel, Tre
                    Pen...</p>
                <p>...man with elaborate camera equipment who said he was with Burton Holmes and
                    Warner Brothers. When I got back to Rimini I had a walk along the beach, but
                    wouldn't care to come to the Adriatic coast for a holiday, although very
                    inexpensive.</p>
                <p>When I arrived at Naples and was checking in at the Royal Hotel I saw Mrs. Hall,
                    the dear mother of Max Hall. She was spending her last night there as she was
                    sailing the next day for the States and I think she was feeling very sad about
                    leaving Naples. Max was going to administrative school in the Department and
                    transferred to Iceland where she would not be going. I suggested that we go to a
                    German restaurant I had heard was excellent and have some good German beer and
                    some wieners. Then, afterwards, from the roof of the Royal we watched the
                    fireworks from the castle just across from the hotel. They were the most
                    gorgeous I have ever seen.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>The next morning I took the boat for Ischia. Jacqueline had reserved a room for
                    me at the Marimare Costello, just under the shadow of the old Arganase castle at
                    Point Ischia. A perfect location directly beside the sea and very comfortable
                    and reasonable and the food was good. The sea bathing was delicious. Jacqueline
                    was taking the cure so I could only see her after 4:00, we would meet for
                    dinner. She knew all of the restaurants so she would go into the kitchen and
                    select what we were to have.</p>
                <p>One day we took a trip in a boat around the island stopping at San Angelo where
                    we took another little boat over to some Roman baths. It was amusing to see some
                    people lying like mummies buried in the radio active sand. It was such fun being
                    with Jacqueline who knew the island so well. I found her more beautiful than
                    ever and so intelligent and charming. She said she was planning to fly to India
                    to work with the Red Cross there. I found her not at all interested in the
                    recent wedding of the Eden girl and the Berreli chap who were married in that
                    little village where his family sold dresses and suits, etc. in a shop we
                    passed.</p>
                <p>I left the island about 4:00 in the afternoon and looked back at what is called
                    the greenest island in Italy because it is almost entirely terraced in vineyards
                    interspersed with groves of citrus fruit years, figs, palms and olive and
                    orchids of peach and mandarin. The loft umbrella pines and architecture of the
                    villas with their white, washed, flat fronts and iron barred windows, reminded
                    me of Morocco.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Naples about 6:00pm and had a bit at Kafluss, a popular restaurant
                    there. Then, down to board the postali. I would have preferred to fly, but was
                    over-weight for the plane. My Italian holiday over.</p>
                <p>When I arrived the next morning at Palermo, as I was going down the gangplank I
                    heard someone call, “Virginia” and was delighted to see little Joy Pole. She had
                    come in the consulate car with Andrea to meet me and brought me home giving me
                    the news en route that the Herdecks had been transferred to Naples. When I
                    reached my little house, Pena came running out with opened arms.</p>
                <p>I went immediately to the consulate and was warmly welcomed by everyone. When I
                    went in to speak to Mr. Keeley, he said, “I was sorry I couldn't accept your
                    sister's invitation in Washington, but I had to go into the hospital and then
                    out to California.” Then added, “I heard you had gone to Rome to say nice things
                    to the evacuees. You must have liked that.” Young Mrs. Keeley had arrived from
                    Amman with her two children and were moving into the Auchincloss apartment and
                    had my Pena help them for a few days, whom they highly praised.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>I invited the Keeleys for luncheon on October 15 and Louise Keeley said her
                    husband, Bob, may arrive from Amman if he could catch a Navy flight from Beirut.
                    So we all waited with great anticipation and he did arrive and come to lunch
                    with his mother, father and wife. So, it was an exciting family reunion. He was
                    perfectly delightful, very good looking with a nice clean cut face.</p>
                <p>I was very sorry to hear of Pope Pius XII's death, having so recently been
                    blessed by him, also the death of Mary Roberts Reinhardt at the age of 82. I
                    remembered so well the day I met her with her son, Alan, at the Eaton's Dude
                    Ranch in Wyoming and she autographed her book which I was reading.</p>
                <p>On October 10th, an OM (operation memorandum) from the Department arrived saying
                    I was assured of receiving my travel orders in time to arrive home for Christmas
                    and my desire for a protocol job would be considered at the time of assignment
                    by the Department, which pleased me very much.</p>
                <p>Margaret Abell, who I had known in Washington, came through Palermo with a friend
                    and they completely convinced me I should fly home via jet. The schedule goes
                    into effect the middle of October. At first I thought it sounded a bit
                    frightening, but Miss Canyon said, “These planes have had more tests than any
                    other.” So, I thought probably I should and would be quite an exciting
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Almost mid-November. Pena left one morning for her home in Castelloammare to
                    obtain a legal separation from her husband and came back that evening looking
                    rather haggard, but so relieved because she had obtained it. She had relations
                    in Brooklyn and Utica, New York and we were trying to get her a visa for the
                    United States. On December 9, I received my travel orders and the news I was
                    being transferred to Stockholm as citizenship and passport assistant. I was, of
                    course, pleased to have the travel orders, but didn't know whether to be pleased
                    with the assignment, preferring warm climates. But Pena was delighted because
                    she does not like hot climates and said, “Senora, I will follow you anywhere but
                    darkest Africa.”</p>
                <p>Shortly after the news came, the Auchinclosses passed through on the Vocanyia and
                    on home leave from Trieste and due to return. Mr. Auchincloss told me Mr.
                    Bonbright had been transferred from Lisbon and was to be the Ambassador in
                    Stockholm. I have never seen a couple with such devoted friends. Nearly all of
                    the diplomatic corps and high officials were aboard drinking champagne with
                    them. They were taking their Italian maid and said they hoped she would stay
                    forever with them. And I had the same feeling about Pena. Audrey's last words to
                    me were, “We will probably see each other some time in Georgetown,” not dreaming
                    that those words would come true later in life.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>Then the parties began. The Marquise Casterelli, who everyone called Emily,
                    invited me to cocktails one evening. She is president of the Italio-American
                    Association and knows everyone as she has lived in Palermo for 30 years. Her
                    other guests were four Italian women and one Italian man, Marquis Gagolo, a
                    great archaeologist who was to have an article in the National Geographic soon.
                    Henrico Elles, her constant companion was also there. He invited us to his place
                    after for dinner. It was great fun.</p>
                <p>One day Henrico took me to a place where I bought a pair of real ceramic
                    pineapples, symbols of hospitality, the last purchase I made for my little
                    house.</p>
                <p>Louise Keeley invited me to Luckaprese for lunch with her mother-in-law and Mrs.
                    Barley, the wife of the British Consul. They were being transferred to Bremen
                    and invited me to visit them there for they were to have a lovely villa.</p>
                <p>One Sunday I had tea with the Duke and Duchess d'Belcito in their charming
                    apartment. He was the Consul for Norway, Denmark and Sweden, so I was interested
                    in what he could tell me about that country. Their apartment was filled with
                    priceless antiques. The Duke showed me around and pointed out six de Monti
                    plates that were given to his mother by the King of Italy. The others are all in
                    the museum in Naples. It is the museum I want most to see the next time I go to
                    Naples where all of the famous de Monti is.</p>
                <p>Miss Whittacker invited me once again to Moufetino for lunch before I left. The
                    zero hour was fast approaching and Pena hoped to have her papers in order to
                    sail December 30. I had been advised to take the postali over to Naples and the
                    train to Rome just in case the airport was closed down as it sometimes is this
                    time of year. So I did, in the pouring rain.</p>
                <p>I was so touched that Henrico von Elles and Emily Casterelli had come to the ship
                    in the down pour bearing long stemmed red roses.</p>
                <p>I had sent my sister a hurried note on September 13 hoping to reach her in
                    Washington before leaving for New York where she was to meet me to say that I
                    was now leaving Rome by a DC plane and joining the jet in Paris as jets were not
                    flying from Rome except on Saturdays because they claimed the noise at that time
                    disturbed the eternal city and hoped to be in New York on schedule Christmas Eve
                    to attend the midnight eve service with her, and I was.</p>
                <p>Stockholm, March 7, 1959-May 26, 1961</p>
                <p>This is a letter written to my sister: Grand Hotel, Stockholm, Saturday, March 7,
                    1959, 10:30pm</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>Just a line before going to bed to say I have finally arrived at my destination.
                    When I got to the airport in Copenhagen this afternoon, I was greeted with the
                    news that my plane for Stockholm would be delayed, so I actually arrived there
                    at 6:15pm and there was no one to meet me. I didn't think too much about that
                    with all the changes, but when I check in at the Grand Hotel, I thought it
                    strange to be told my reservations had been canceled several days ago. So, I
                    phoned the embassy, it was closed being Saturday and the Marine Guard on duty
                    knew nothing about my arrival. By this time I was beginning to wonder if I had
                    been assigned to Stockholm after all. Eventually I was connected with Mr.
                    Persons the administrative officer who explained that he had sent someone to
                    meet me but they were misinformed about my arrival time. He said they were to
                    have taken me directly to the apartment assigned to me where the frig should
                    have been filled with food. But, it was finally decided that I should stay the
                    night at the hotel. I was just as glad, for I am sure I would have felt terribly
                    forlorn on my first night going into a strange new apartment all alone and
                    sitting down to a glass of milk on the kitchen table. As it was, I freshened up
                    and went into the dining room which was gay with music, flowers and candles on
                    the table and had a delicious dinner and a most exquisite and happy to be in
                    such charming surroundings. I was given a nice single room but with one of those
                    European type small semi-type bathtubs, but knew it was only for one night. I
                    enquired about services at the Anglican church tomorrow thinking I would go as
                    usual at 8:30am, but an English elevator boy who said he used to sing in the
                    choir there spoke up immediately and said, “Oh, EVERYONE will be at the 11:00
                    service, including the Queen and diplomatic corps.” I decided to sleep on it. It
                    is late so will say, “good night” and continue this tomorrow. Love Virginia</p>
                <p>Sunday, March 8, 1959</p>
                <p>It was clear, cold and bright as I went to church this morning to attend my usual
                    8:30 services at the Anglican church of St. Peter and St. Siegfried and there
                    admired the most beautiful stain glass window in memory of Margaret, first wife
                    of the present King of Sweden, who died in 1920 and who was also English, as is
                    his present wife, Louise, Lady Mountbatten, sister of Lord Louis
                    Mountbatten.</p>
                <p>On a knoll, not far away, stood our American embassy, located near the Norwegian
                    and British embassies. The residence, now occupied by our American Ambassador,
                    Bonbright, was nearby. The front lawn beautifully sloping down to the water's
                    edge. Sidney Schuller, consul of the visa and citizenship section, called for me
                    with the keys to the apartment I was to have in the government furnished
                    quarters in a modern apartment building at 15 Oxenstierngotten. The name
                    intrigued me and I was to learn that Oxenstiern was the steadfast, brilliant,
                    loyal chancellor of Gustav II and when the King died in 1632, he became the
                    regent of Gustav's daughter, the romantic Christina, then eight years old, who
                    abdicated in 1654. Many of the staff lived in this building.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>My apartment was number 32 on the third floor and it was a pleasant surprise to
                    find a girl I had known in Bangkok who was of Polish origin, Elinor Kaienicki,
                    and was a secretary to the Agricultural Attach�. The building had an elevator
                    and there was storage space for trunks on the top floor and in the basement
                    where there was also a laundry room with electric washing machine and dryer and
                    several vacuums for the tenants.</p>
                <p>The apartment had a pretty aquamarine tiled bathroom where I was pleased to see
                    had a full length bathtub. It was furnished in Danish modern with curtains of
                    chartreuse and darkest blue. I was very lucky that there was an extra bedroom
                    with its own frig and lavatory and separate entrance where I could put up Pena,
                    my Italian maid who was to follow me, who had said pending my transfer from
                    Palermo, “Senora, I will follow you anywhere except darkest Africa.”</p>
                <p>I had no bills to pay except for the telephone. My air and steamer freight had
                    arrived so I could unpack my blankets, although it didn't seem as cold as I
                    expected due to the fact, I learned later, that the Gulf Stream was in the
                    Atlantic Ocean. A portion of my effects, including my pony cart had to be stored
                    in Genoa for two years. The apartment was located near a shopping center called
                    Konsun where lots of fruits, vegetables and tinned things could be found. And,
                    it was just about ten or fifteen minutes from town where the shops were filled
                    with beautiful things. I felt fortunate to be ensconced in a Danish modern
                    furnished apartment so quickly and that it was within walking distance to the
                    embassy and especially when I heard it was most difficult to find places to live
                    here.</p>
                <p>I reported to work on Monday morning. The offices were also furnished with
                    functional furniture and there was a tiny desk, so compact, obviously reserved
                    for me as consular assistant to Sidney Schuller, a very pleasant person whose
                    owl-like eyes behind dark horn rimmed glasses impressed me. My duties were to
                    register American citizens, issue and renew their passports, report births and
                    deaths and be in charge of the classified files. My Swedish colleague was a
                    pretty girl called Aagot. All of the Swedish girls had a certain delicate
                    feminine refinement that was very appealing. The hours were from 8:30am to
                    5:00pm with a half hour for lunch and there was a cafeteria in the building and
                    also a PX.</p>
                <p>One evening one of the girls at the embassy, Audrey Miller, invited me to go with
                    her to see “My Fair Lady.” Of course it was in Swedish and has been a big hit
                    here as it has been in the States as we so well know having seen it twice and
                    loved it. These charming songs will ever ring in my ears.</p>
                <p>On Sunday, Genevieve Rowan, Ambassador Bonbright's secretary, had me out to her
                    little house for supper with one of the other secretaries. And, Wednesday, one
                    of the girls I knew in Bangkok invited me for dinner. I am liking very much the
                    personnel of the embassy and my apartment. Love Virginia</p>
                <p>Palm Sunday, March 21, 1959</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>Dearest Mildred</p>
                <p>I began lessons once a week in Swedish and to brush up on my Italian, I began
                    lessons the other day. I went to 8:30 communion this morning and am so happy to
                    have the Anglican church so near. Kiril Forelius, the nephew of my Finnish
                    friend, Lisa Lotta Valesca, called last Sunday and upon entering my apartment,
                    bowed low, kissed my hand and presented me with one lovely pink rose. It touched
                    me deeply and cheered my rather bare apartment, to say nothing of myself.</p>
                <p>March 24, Wednesday</p>
                <p>I heard that Pena's ship the Gripsong is leaving New York on April 9 and will
                    stop at Bremerhaven on the 17th. I decided to write Mr. Barley, the British I
                    knew in Palermo who was transferred there, that Pena would be on board. I knew
                    he would remember her pizzas.</p>
                <p>When Paul H. Pearson, the Consul General in Goteborg, was in our office, I
                    mentioned that Pena would be arriving there and he very kindly said to notify
                    consul Woollons when she was ready to disembark and he would assist me.</p>
                <p>March 31</p>
                <p>Dearest Mildred,</p>
                <p>I just learned that the famous Passion Play at Oberammergau in Germany occurs
                    only every ten years will be performed on May 16, 1960. Shall we make
                    arrangements to go? I should love to see it.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Washington, a friend there, Hedda Van Missenburg, gave me a note
                    of introduction to the Italian Ambassador which I presented shortly after my
                    arrival. A few days later he invited me to dinner saying, “No black tie, we
                    don't dress.” So I put on my black taffeta and tucked a red rose at the waist
                    and wore my Cavershawn star rubies. The Italian embassy where the residence and
                    offices were located was beautifully situated right on the harbor where sail
                    boats pass by the front lawn. It had formerly been the home of the brother of
                    the present King of Sweden who married a relative of the Russian Tsar and I
                    learned later had also been the American embassy when Nelson Morris had been
                    Ambassador and remember he had been a friend of my brother-in-law, Jim Trimble,
                    and had sent a beautiful wedding gift when he married my sister Mildred.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>When I arrived, the Ambassador greeted me graciously and I conveyed greetings
                    from his old friend the Duke de Belcito I had known in Palermo. He said his wife
                    was presently in Italy. The other guests were an Italian girl just back from
                    Egypt who was married to one of Sweden's foremost actors, Palme was the name,
                    who sat to my left at dinner. He said he could obtain tickets for me at the
                    interesting old 18th century theater Drotnehand when it opened. Then there was
                    another very nice young girl, part Viennese and part Czechoslovakian, who was a
                    refugee. The other two were men, one an Italian consul of the embassy and the
                    other a Swedish baron who brought me home. We were served champagne, red caviar
                    before dinner. Two white gloved butlers served a delicious dinner with white
                    wine and again champagne. The center piece on the dining table was an enormous
                    bowl filled with yellow jonquils and sweet smelling narcissus. On leaving, Mrs.
                    Palme said she would send me a card of her shop, the only Italian one in
                    Stockholm where she hoped to see me one day in old town. Also told me about a
                    place that specialized in the Italian shoes for about $14, which I decided I
                    must find for they are the only kind I will wear again. It had been a thoroughly
                    enjoyable evening.</p>
                <p>On hearing of the earthquake in Kobe, my thoughts went back to the day I was
                    married there sixty four years ago. I sailed from San Francisco on the NYK liner
                    the Tasatu Maru to become the bride of Charles Biddle and we lived in Kobe for
                    the next two and a half years. In those days, people still spoke often of the
                    devastating quake in which more than 140,000 people lost their lives in 1923,
                    and Charlie remembered escaping in his pajamas. Now, over six decades later
                    another quake has taken the lives of over 5,000 people, maybe some of the gentle
                    Japanese whom I had known, certainly some of their children, grandchildren or
                    great grandchildren. Charlie had recently been transferred to the Osaka branch
                    from the Peking branch of the National City Bank of New York, now called City
                    Bank, and we lived two and a half years in Shukugawa where the Bank had a
                    compound of four houses connected by gardens and overlooking a double tennis
                    court. It was one of those charming houses that awaited me when I was married in
                    All Saints Church in Kobe on October 11, 1930. America was caught up at that
                    time in a terrible economic depression but we seemed far removed from that in
                    Kobe. My husband gave me a hundred dollars a month for our household and I
                    always came out ahead. We played bridge with other American and British families
                    and traveled whenever possible to see more of Japan in his Packard roadster. I
                    loved the beautiful country and I adored the quiet manners of the Japanese. On
                    Sundays we attended services at All Saints Church. Thinking of it all these
                    years later, I telephoned the office of the presiding bishop of the Episcopal
                    Church and learned that All Saints had been destroyed in World War II and had
                    become part of the Cathedral, St. Michael's, which is now heavily damaged. It
                    is, of course, only one of many changes that have come to my beloved Kobe. And
                    now there will be more change, rebuilding and starting again. My heart goes out
                    to Kobe. I am profoundly shocked by this sudden tragedy that has come to its
                    people and to the country I loved so much.</p>
