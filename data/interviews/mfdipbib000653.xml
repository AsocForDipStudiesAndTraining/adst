                <p>PENELOPE (PENNE) LAINGEN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi and Joan Williamson</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 30, 1990</p>
                <p>LAINGEN: (beginning mid-sentence) that he probably did her a favor by sending her
                    on somewhere else. Macomber just wheeled on me and said, “I disagree! We're
                    going to teach these countries our way of life. We want our women to have the
                    equality and-” It really just floored me, because it was the total opposite to
                    what I'd been led to believe or trained in going overseas, that we were guests
                    in these countries, that we should not show American arrogance.My opinion, you
                    see, was not on the ascendancy, it was descending in our society, and he was
                    simply not going to let the momentum die out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): He was also non-career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: The other thing was, when Carol Pardon was talking I agreed with most of
                    what she said. This is the interesting thing that later I'll tell you about — a
                    letter where people misunderstood what I was saying. At any rate, she was
                    against the hierarchy of spouses and the anachronisms of protocol, dropping
                    cards and so forth, and the way women were second-class citizens, appendages to
                    their husbands and all that. She wanted to wipe the whole slate clean. I
                    remember saying at that point, “I agree with you up to a point but there are
                    women who have devoted their whole lives to the Foreign Service, who take this
                    partnership seriously. And you destroy that raison d'etre, you're going
                    t(laughing) have more problems than you can imagine. And again Macomber said,
                    “Too late. You're out of step.”</p>
                <p>So I thought to myself, I don't know why I came [to the meeting], because they've
                    got it all in their heads how it's to be, how it's going to be. I really didn't
                    care, at that point, because we were posted at home and I could be free of all
                    the disagreeableness, (laughter) until l977, when my husband was appointed
                    Ambassador to Malta. I remember at my husband's swearing in someone came up to
                    me and said, “I wonder what kind of an ambassador's wife you're going to make.”
                    I recall saying, “Look, I'm not an 'ambassador's wife', I happen to be married
                    to the ambassador.” I'd picked up the line that everybody was spieling, and
                    trying to go along with the Directive and understand it. I hope you've
                    interviewed Sallie Lewi(Fenzi says “yes”) because she could tell you of Marlen
                    (Neumann's) reaction and her reaction to the Directive when it came out at post
                    in Afghanistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):They just went right on doing what they were
                        doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:Oh, they did?See, I missed all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): What was the outcome of that first meeting?
                        Because that was the very first meeting when they got everybody
                        together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I'm not even sure of that, I'd have to look back in the files. But it
                    was Gladys Rogers, whoever she was —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): She must have been a member of WAO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I sort of thought she was a Department, maybe Macomber's deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Oh, that could be.We'll look her up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:We'll have to look her up. She was in charge of that meeting. Whether it
                    was the first I don't know, but it was certainly the Women's Action Organization
                    that had called it together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): But had anything been published about —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Nothing at all. I know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): But see, the first published thing was June 1971,
                        and that was the Guidelines which were drafted under Dorothy Stansbury. But
                        this was before that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Yes. Because the Guidelines — I have all this, I'm going to give you a
                    photocopy that talks about the Guidelines. Then there were numerous reactions to
                    the Guidelines that were in. Here's from Ambassadors, John Kenneth Galbraith's
                    reactions, and so forth.I also have Carol Pardon's article for you. You know, at
                    the time she seemed very revolutionary to those of us who had been immersed in
                    this traditional system. I can look at it now and think, “Gee, why didn't we see
                    that?” How clear headed she was. But I really didn't have much quarrel with her,
                    I just thought it was sort of revolutionary and it probably would never
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Do you have Eleanore Lee writing as “Mary Stuart”
                        in that same issue, saying that the Guidelines would never work, because it
                        didn't matter what kind of guidelines you set forth for the wife, it
                        depended on what the Ambassador and his spouse would like. We do have a copy
                        of that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: That is really the point that hit me square in the face when I got to
                    Malta. I had no choice as an ambassador's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Let's go back a momenWhat happened after that
                        first meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I heard nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Oh, you did nothing more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: No. I think I was just a total failure, you see, because I was
                    representing the wrong “mode”, the wrong side.(laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): You didn't go to any of the open forums?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: No. I never knew about them. It's really strange. I had a young baby. I
                    probably wasn't too keyed in. I remember hearing about it after the fact. I
                    wished that I had. Yes, this WAO group suggested that this forum take place.
                    That I know was a step. Then, here is this international dialogue among Foreign
                    Service women, so they had that; also, they brought in some of the foreign
                    embassies to see what they thought. At any rate, I know that later on I heard
                    how the Directive came about and I have a memo on that if you want me to insert
                    that now.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>That was when we were working on the l985 Spouse Report. Kathleen Boswell and I,
                    who were co-chairmen, went to see Mr. Robert S. Steven, a former staffer for
                    William B. Macomber. We had lunch at the Foreign Service Club and he told us
                    various things concerning how the Directive came about. [reading] “The decision
                    to go ahead with the Directive was taken when William B. Macomber was Deputy
                    Under Secretary for Management.” Steven was a member of Macomber's staff and
                    designated as the liaison between the Women's Action Organization and M
                    [Management]. “Mr. Steven said that M decided to look into the spouse question
                    because of an ever increasing number of spouse related grievances and because
                    WAO was becoming militant on women's issues. Pressure from the two sources
                    motivated M to put together several panels ...” see, the one that I attended was
                    one of those panels, “some composed of Department of State principals and some
                    composed of representative spouses to consider the problem. M also asked WAO to
                    present its proposals for reform concerning Foreign Service spouses to the Open
                    Forum.” So that's how that came about.</p>
                <p>“M initially saw no reason to change the policy on spouses.” Now, that was
                    interesting to us because, you see, here it is l985 and we are seeing all the
                    problems that stem from that Directive — not the Directive per se, but from
                    outcroppings of what happened after that. Interestingly enough, we see that some
                    people in M were kind of worried and felt exactly as I did, that you destroy the
                    system totally, you're going to have women out there whose raison d'etris
                    destroyed, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi):You're making this comment as of 1971 or 1985?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: This is l983, actually. And that Mr. Steven says that even before they
                    formulated the Directive they knew they were going to have problems, but they
                    went ahead with it anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Well, Hop[Meyers] had a comment on that. She said
                        that the Department just assumed that there would be enough senior spouses
                        to pick up the pieces and carry on as they had in the past. And that's
                        absolutely what happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: And if you look at the Directive, it does say “Oh, we'd be so happy if
                    you do go on” and “we have no objections to wives who choose to go on and do
                    this.” But what the psychological aspect of that was saying “we don't care
                    whether you do it, it would be nice if you do it, but you're really not
                    necessary.” And that was a lethal thing to do. I mean, for some women. Now, for
                    the younger ones who didn't have these representational responsibilities,
                    WHOOPEE! The doors were open, “I don't have to drop cards any more.” And for
                    some of us — I had more horror stories than anybody about that system, in fear
                    and trembling as a young spouse, so I was happy to be rid of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But when I got to Malta, I suddenly realized, as an ambassador's wife, that the
                    freedom was not for me. It was declared hypocritically, really, because what the
                    Department did was destroy the partnership when it was still there, as you said.
                    As long as the hierarchy of officers exists, the wife spouse cannot be easily
                    divorced from it, and you've got problems within the family. Janet Lloyd told
                    m(laughing) that FLO had become “a walking divorce court” at the time when she
                    first took over. At any rate, to get back to this — I'm sorry to keep bouncing
                    back and forth — but here is Robert Steven telling us that they really were
                    concerned at that time. What tipped the balance in the decision, though, was the
                    opinion of the Department of State's lawyer who, upon reviewing the traditional
                    status of spouses, “found existing policy to be legally indefensible because the
                    spouse was not an employee.” So here you've got the Department of State trying
                    to avoid litigation. (Pro bono attorney for the Foreign Service Spouse Oral
                    History said that a spouse could not litigate, but that the FSO could file suit
                    on her behalf.) And that is the main reason that Directive was written. (No
                    references to this have been found in researching pre Directive documents.) It
                    was to get the Department of State off the legal hook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Do you mean to tell me that a spouse was going to
                        sue the Department because they were making demands upon her-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Illegal demands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): I didn't think you could sue the United States
                        Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Oh, yes, you can sue the State Department, certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): You can sue the Secretary of State. That's
                        where that Alison Palmer —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Maybe you can sue an individual but I don't think
                        you can sue the Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): I think you may be right, Jewell. Because the
                        discrimination suit that was brought, as far as the women and Alison Palmer
                        et al., was brought against the Secretary of State — as, I assume, the
                        representative of the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I suppose a spouse could sue an ambassador. Right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): It would be interesting to find out who those
                        lawyers were who felt that this was a problem, and whether there was
                        actually a case about which they were concerned.</hi>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, these were State Department lawyers, so it could easily be found —
                    who was Legal Adviser at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): This would be early '7[confirmed by the
                        others].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: The Department of State had to clarify its legal position to avoid
                    litigation, so I think you can sue the State Department. According to Mr.
                    Steven, it was not a welcome decision because M fully realized the positive
                    contribution of the spouse to the Foreign Service and did not diminish the
                    traditional relationship. Mr. Steven was asked to re-word the WAO proposals,
                    which I thought was interesting because they were written in what was considered
                    “strident language” (the three all laugh) “and to incorporate those proposals
                    with a legally defensible status for the Foreign Service spouse. That status was
                    'no status', in what became the l972 policy on wives of Foreign Service
                    employees.”</p>
                <p>Now, that statement is Mr. Steven. That “status”, he says, was really “no
                    status”. “Mr. Steven has not been directly involved in the spouse issue since he
                    left M but he continues to follow it out of personal interest.” (laughter again)
                    “More recently Mr. Steven as an inspector was disturbed by what he saw as a
                    trend towards further distancing of the Department of State and spouses. He felt
                    that Department initiatives like the establishment of FLO and separate
                    maintenance allowance increased the distance initiated by the l972 decision, but
                    he suggested that the Foreign Service is changing too. As an inspector for the
                    Management audit of the recruitment, examination and employment function of the
                    Department of State, he became aware of a growing gap between the traditional
                    Foreign Service and the type of officer now coming into the Foreign Service. He
                    said that what may be seen as a lack of commitment by the spouse might be only a
                    reflection of the lack of commitment by the officer.” I thought that was
                    interesting!</p>
                <p>“He said that his audit had not included a recommendation to the Director General
                    to commission a demographic study of the Personnel system. He knew that the
                    Director General had recently contracted with a consulting firm to undertake
                    this study, and he suggested that we approach the Director General on the
                    possibility of including the Forum Committee's Role of the Spouse questionnaire
                    in the consultant's forthcoming questionnaire.” Which we didn't: we went off and
                    got our own money.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>At any rate, I felt, reading this morning's paper about these soldiers and women
                    soldiers, in Saudi Arabia, and someone has written a Letter to the Editor
                    [presumably of The Washington Post] saying that these women are no different
                    than men soldiers, they should be treated the same and so forth — total
                    misunderstanding of the idea that we are guests in these countries. We cannot,
                    as Americans, go in, which we do so often, and just ram our culture down
                    everyone's throat. So, to this day I would love to talk to Macomber about it.
                    Maybe he's mellowed by now.(all laugh)</p>
                <p>At any rate, that was that meeting. And as I say, when it came down to being an
                    ambassador's wife, the Directive was totally incomprehensible to me. I was
                    working very, very hard. I had no choice in the matter. It was in a very small,
                    l00% Catholic country, family oriented, traditional, It had been under British
                    rule in the days of the Raj ,and they expected all the women to troop out in
                    their formal dresses. It was still that way, and sometimes when I didn't go to a
                    function, I would run into a Maltese who would say, “Where were you? Were you
                    sick?” I mean, it was impossible. It had just had to be undertaken. Otherwise, I
                    could have left pos(laughter). I really was a painter and a writer, and I longed
                    to do these things, but I simply didn't have the time.</p>
                <p>It was sort of ironic because I helped a young staff officer's wife. I introduced
                    her to a friend who was an opera star, and Carol picked up on her career. I sat
                    there and watched her on stage, you know, yet was unable to do the things that I
                    wanted to do. So in l978, here comes from Janet Lloyd's office, the new FLO
                    office, a letter suggesting that they are going to review the Directive. Now,
                    this came out of the l977 Forum report which made various recommendations. One
                    was to establish the Family Liaison Office, and among other things was to “Let's
                    get this Directive straight for those spouses who are not free.” Do you know, of
                    that l977 report, it's interesting: this is the one issue that has never been
                    solved. They did everything else that those folks recommended, except that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): When Janet sent that letter, who was recommending
                        that the Directive be reviewed? FLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, you see, that's what I'm saying: From the l977 Forum report, she's
                    trying to — not only did she (Janet Lloyd) come into position because of that
                    report, but she was taking all these recommendations step by step. So, one was
                    to review the Directive. Here: “Department to review the '72 directive on
                    Spouses.” And, she said, she sent it to all posts, and she said, “if you don't
                    vote don't crab.” So immediately I called all the gals in the Embassy together
                    and we sat down — I didn't have a traditional “wives group” or anything like
                    that, but everyone was interested and happy to come and talk about it. And every
                    single one of those gals sat down and wrote a paper on all her feelings about
                    this Directive and many other side issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I remember one older wife was very worried about retirement and the pensions and
                    so forth. The only wife, however, who was really angry about the system and
                    wanted to be free of it had five children, and she and her husband were fighting
                    like cats and dogs, have since divorced, over the issue. He was a real martinet.
                    He would come and ask, “Have you written your thank you note to Mrs. De Medici,”
                    (or something) and she'd say, “That's not my job, that's your job.” With that
                    kind of thing going on, that marriage did split. At any rate we all wrote a
                    paper. My idea was that while we welcomed the changes in the strict, rigid
                    protocol, et cetera, and that I didn't particularly care about being “an
                    ambassador's wife,” i.e., I wasn't bothered at not being able to direct junior
                    wives, but I felt there was merit to a system where you could go to any post and
                    fit in immediately, you were welcomed, there was an apparatus. And nothing had
                    been substituted for that apparatus.</p>
                <p>Maybe FLO would be that eventually, and I suppose it has been, for CLOs.But at
                    that point, when I arrived at this small post I was astounded to find that
                    certain wives didn't know one another, that my predecessor had made no effort to
                    draw the spouses together. It just seemed incredible to me. Now, I could have
                    let that go, I could have done the same thing, I expect. But I can tell you, we
                    had a very happy association, and I believe there was merit to trying to
                    continue to foster that kind of community spirit. And I felt it did fall, kind
                    of, to the ambassador's wife to do that. She may not be a natural leader, but I
                    felt there was deference in that direction, that people did look to you whether
                    you took that role or not.</p>
                <p>That was the gist of my paper. And I felt that while I didn't want the total
                    Directive rewritten, I felt that something should be added to encourage those of
                    us who were not as free as this policy says. At any rate I was astounded to find
                    that the reaction was totally negative against any revision. But as it turned
                    out, they got 63 responses, 36 of which opposed revising the Directive.I was
                    just appalled. I thought, “36 people are responsible for saying how it will
                    stay.” There was something wrong with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Well, there must have been an even smaller
                        minority who got the Directive put in place in the first place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Right! (she laughs) And mostly men. (she laughs) I think David Newsom
                    doesn't dare look me in the eye these days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): I don't know him, nor Martin Hillenbrand either,
                        but he was a high ranking Department official who was responsible also.
                        (Newsom and Hillenbrand as chiefs of African and European bureaus
                        respectively, signed the Directive to show cohesiveness in the Department,
                        no matter how diversified the bureau.)</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): So, there were 36 responses for, and 27
                        against. It's only 60% that supported no revisions.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Not unanimous, but very few responded at
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Right.But the thing that has always been the problem — I found this true
                    in doing the l985 report — is that we do everything by majority. And it really
                    shouldn't work that way, because we're not talking about a monolithic group of
                    women, or spouse(murmurs of agreement). So in our spouse report we had to look
                    at the various groups that we're talking about, and by breaking it down that
                    way, the minority definitely in numbers is the group of senior Foreign Service
                    spouses (today, I have to say “spouses of senior officers”), we found they had
                    the lowest morale in the Foreign Service. Yet they were doing two-thirds of the
                    number of hours of representational work and they did not feel they were free.
                    So you could say “the majority, they aren't put upon.” But, see, that doesn't
                    tell you anything. That's not fair to the minority. Because the majority doesn't
                    have the representational expectations that are on the minority's shoulders. So
                    that was the way I felt about this decision taking the majority word that
                    everything was just hunky-dory the way it was. To me that was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):So what happened then, Penne. To go back a
                        bit, in '78, then, after they got this 36-24 vote or whatever it was, what
                        happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: That was IT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):They just decided — Janet Lloyd dropped it
                        then at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: Just dropped it. I was so appalled by that that I wrote a letter, which
                    appeared in the October l978 issue — now that I look back I smile, because it
                    was rather naive. Anyway, I have a letter here from Janet Lloyd, who says: “I
                    very much enjoyed talking to you and the Newsletter was so impressed with your
                    letter that they plan on publishing it next month.” So, they did, and here it
                    is: “An Ambassador's Wife Enters the Debate.” Generally I was saying that while
                    the Directive meant well, some of us were not as free as it implied. That has
                    always been my basis for feeling, because at that point in time the Department
                    was telling me I was free to do anything I wanted, and that was just not
                    correct. And at the same time, there was no way of their telling me “thank you,”
                    either. So you begin to think, “Gee, I put all my eggs in this basket, this
                    partnership which meant so much to me for 30 years, and then suddenly it means
                    nothing to anybody. Therefore, what am I?” In those days, we didn't talk about
                    “self esteem,” we didn't talk about ourselves that much, did we? We did the
                    work, and talked about our husbands, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): That's quite true, you know. Often, I'll ask
                        people, “Do you have a resume, or something about your career?” And they'll
                        invariably give you some writeup on what their husbands have done; those in
                        our generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:It's sad. But there's much to be said for the women's lib movement, I'm
                    not saying there isn't. However, I feel that the juncture of the Directive was
                    the point where, instead of throwing out the partnership, they should have made
                    it more important and said to the others, “You're free, you're all free to do
                    what you want to do, but if you choose to do this, this is what we will do for
                    you.” At that point, they should have paid us, or they should have done
                    something to keep that partnership strong and keep it a viable role. But perhaps
                    they couldn't have - with the feeling of individualism, and independence, and
                    liberation that was so prevalent then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): And always fighting a budget. They've never
                        been very clever at getting money out of Congress for anything, let alon— I
                        mean, the essentials they barely get the money for. To get it for something
                        beyond that is usually turned down, because they don't know how to fight for
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: But, you see, the thing that was so wrong was that a social movement in
                    this country, which was trying to get women to strike out on their own (there
                    were a number of divorces, women had to fall back on something if their husbands
                    left them, and so forth) it was a movement which really didn't fit into the
                    Foreign Service life style very well. As we say in the l985 Spouse Report, it
                    was like fitting a round peg into a square hole. Now, it was bound to move
                    toward a Service of single careerists —</p>

                    reply, “Yes.”)Now, the singles are unhappy, “hanh -hanh- hanhhh!” [like

                        duty, no concept of service in the Foreign Service, it was all the
                        introspective “me” solution to things. Of course, it was written by a woman
                        who was not a Foreign Service officer. She's a Washington free lance writer

                </p>
                <p>At the end of my l978 letter, (in State Magazine) I said, “Hand in hand with the
                    women's liberation movement has come a most unfortunate trend in attitudes
                    towards traditional wives. The Foreign Service, it seems, is no different in
                    that respect. To read that the best preparation for being the wife of a diplomat
                    is an '8th grade education and a love of the kitchen' makes me very sad, and
                    angry, too. This attitude lies between the lines of the l972 Directive because
                    it implies that a wife is an unnecessary appendage to her husband. We seem also
                    to have lost all our ideals that helped to make our country great —
                    volunteerism, patriotism, pioneering, selflessness, neighborliness, public
                    service. It's no wonder that we've reached the point where we have to be paid
                    for everything that we do.” Well, what happened after that: I got a number of
                    personal letters, saying “right on, a great letter, etc. etc.” but no one
                    publicly supported me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Did you get any public disagreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Oh, yes, yes, I did. And the next issue of State magazine carried a
                    letter from Carolyn Barrett, who I learned later was a young AID wife. Among
                    other things she said that “females have been traditionally socialized toward
                    such sadomasochistic roleplaying in most societies. It blocks authentic behavior
                    and helps anesthetize the individual to the pain their position would otherwise
                    cause them.” She called me a sadomasochist for continuing to work without pay.
                    And she says, “Women who have been born, reared and lived in an environment that
                    allows them the authentic self-expressions do not fit comfortably in the
                    traditional role of the diplomat's wife.” She said what I really was upset about
                    was “the loss of my traditional right to victimize junior spouses.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Another letter came from Harrison B. Sherwood. The essence of his letter was that
                    there is no way the traditional wife can get back her self esteem unless she is
                    paid, because she has been legally removed from the system. Then there was a
                    letter from Elinor Constable, who says she'd been a longtime friend of Penne
                    Laingen and hoped that she didn't upset me if she disagreed with me. Her general
                    thesis was that the Directive should not be changed, because what it really did
                    was excuse women from “a narrow, institutionalized responsibility and freed them
                    to a broader responsibility.” What? To themselves?</p>
                <p>You see, that is the fallacy of the idea that you're free of all responsibility,
                    by being your own person you have a broader outlook. I think, what greater
                    responsibility can there be but to your country, to your family, to your
                    husband, to your children? I don't understand it, myself. And I don't to this
                    day. However, she was one who had been an officer, came back into the Service,
                    and she has been an ambassador. We're still friends. But I can't understand it —
                    when her husband was back here, she was always overseas or something. They've
                    lived apart for a number of years. So that was the system that was being
                    created. But the thing that upset me about Elinor's letter was that, again, she
                    misunderstood in a way what I was saying. I didn't care about the hierarchy, I
                    didn't care about victimizing junior spouses - I simply was saying, “Hey, I
                    mean, if I'm free, free me!” Let me be as free as any other spouse. And I still
                    feel thi— in my interview that I did with you, Jewell, I said to this day an
                    ambassador's wife is not allowed to work, she can't be a CLO. So she's not
                    “free.” She still is not free of these responsibilities unless she leaves the
                    post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Well, she's still going to have the
                        responsibilities anyway — there's no way she can get out of them unless she
                        plans to hide out in the back scullery corner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, then people did come to my rescue. Including my husband, who said,
                    “I've known Penne Laingen a long time and I don't find her sadomasochistic.”
                    (hearty laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Well, fortunately for that, Penne!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: “And I find such allegations unfair, unfounded and unnecessary.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): But how extraordinary that this whole debate
                        evolved this way, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: It just turned ugly, it really did. I had a lovely letter from Anne
                    MacFarland. She was an officer and she married one. She said she totally agreed
                    with me and said, “I can see both sides.” And then the loveliest thing was to
                    have the Embassy wives come to my rescue. One letter: “Observing Mrs. Laingen,
                    one can only wonder at the official policy which states that the Foreign Service
                    wife is free to follow her own interests.” So I think that's very nice.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Then I returned to the US in l979. I was really looking forward to being home.
                    Bruce was going into the Inspection Corps, he didn't really have another post,
                    so as an Inspector he was to set off for South America. He went to Minnesota to
                    visit his family. Meanwhile I'd been in Malta packing up, so we were apart from
                    his departure in January until March when I got home. He went to Minnesota, then
                    back to Malta for the CFCE conference. What I'm getting at is that we were
                    really apart for all of l979, because in May when he was in Minnesota the
                    Department called and asked would he go to Tehran — just for 4-6 weeks to fill
                    in for Charlie Naas, who was the charg� d'affaires, as I believe was stated in
                    my earlier interview.</p>
                <p>I was very happy to be home, able to set up my household, get up every morning
                    having my own routine, and reall(she laughs) take the Directive seriously! Then,
                    as you know, BANG, Bruce was taken hostage. You could say, “Well, you're free to
                    do your own thing. You're your own person.” I could have gone about and said
                    what I really thought about the President or the policies on Iran. But you are,
                    as I've said so many times to young wives, you really are in the Foreign
                    Service. I don't care how you slice it, as long as you're married to this
                    individual you really have to consider the Foreign Service. Had I misbehaved
                    during the hostage crisis, I think they (the Department officials) would have
                    called me in and said, “Huh uh, this is a no-no, you can't behave this way.”
                    (They did reprimand another wife for criticizing the Department publicly.)</p>
                <p>But also as a result of the Directive, I got no support from the Department as
                    Bruce's wife. You see what I'm saying. They would call me in, yes, as an
                    individual, “How are you feeling” and so forth, but when the Bishop is calling
                    me, from the Cathedral, deferring to me as the wife of the chief of mission in
                    Tehran, there are expectations that you have a role there. And I did not get any
                    support in that role from the Department of State. Probably it doesn't matter;
                    it's insignificant. But it just points up the hypocrisy of the whole policy.</p>
                <p>Now, yesterday, when I see Mrs. Nathaniel Howell at the airport greeting the
                    families coming home from Kuwait and Iraq, and seeing she has the support, she
                    has the Department saying “you should be there,” that's what I did not have
                    throughout that whole hideous 1979-81 crisis; which I think is wrong. Not only
                    that, but afterwards never once did any official say “thank you for the way you
                    did behave.” Not once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): No letters or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: Nothing, absolutely nothing. And during the crisis, not one official
                    saying, “Can I take your son to a basketball game?” Or “How's your car?” or
                    “How's your house?” “Your finances?” Nothing. The families who were coming in
                    from the outside — they had a quota of two people to bring: a mother and father,
                    or a wife and a child, and would have their way paid to Washington to attend
                    these meetings or to go to the Cathedral services or whatnot. So I said, “Is it
                    possible for my son, in college in Minnesota, who is up there facing the media
                    alon(and so forth) to have his way home paid to come to the meeting with me?”
                    “No,” they said, “we're not going to start a precedent.” It was bad, very bad.
                    And I hope to goodness that the Department has learned something from that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi and Williamson):We shall see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): And so that experience led you to become involved
                        in the spouse committee of the Forum to do the report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Right. (some discussion as to year of the report) The committee meeting
                    began in '83. Now... let's see how that came about. (she shows them a picture) I
                    participated in the Georgetown Symposium —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): We have that. This was 1981.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: My point in the Georgetown symposium essay was precisely that it really
                    was a moot point, because my husband was still a hostage when I wrote that, and
                    whether I was suggesting that the only solution I could see was to ask a spouse
                    if she wants to be a partner or an individual, if she says “partner” then pay
                    her to do the work.</p>
                <p>So then I was called in to be on this committee of AAFSW part of the Forum,
                    called the Spouse Committee. We met first at the home of Katie Miller, I
                    believe, and I have written you some notes about what we discussed. There again,
                    the issue of the Directive was raised once more — that it had not been solved by
                    the l977 Forum paper (nor by FLO). Mostly at that meeting everyone was relating
                    what they had found at post, what was going on and the unhappiness, the lack of
                    coordination and community spirit, and so on. I remember saying, “I think we
                    need to put out a questionnaire, because there's no way you can write a report
                    and really know what people are thinking unless you ask them. Because, there
                    again, you may just be taking the opinion of one small group.”</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Then we finally realized that we needed professional help in putting this
                    questionnaire together.Kathleen Boswell knew of a man, Mr. Hursh-Cesar, who was
                    a professional, who said he would help us formulate the questions. We needed
                    money, so then we went to the Una Chapman Cox Foundation, which gave us a grant
                    that meant we could have the questionnaire computerized and done professionally.
                    They would also pay for printing the Report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi):As I've told you many times, I think the Report is
                        splendid. But, what was the purpose of the Report ? What was AAFSW trying to
                        do with the Report?Just show how various Foreign Service wives felt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: No. I tell you, the reason for the confusion —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): (laughing) I didn't even know there was any
                        confusion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Yes, there was. It began wit— Sue Parsons was president of AAFSW, Sue
                    Low was Forum chairman, Kathleen Boswell and I were co-chairmen of the Spouse
                    Committee. Eventually our group boiled down to these four people meeting, and we
                    met through the whole process of the questionnaire and mailing and so forth.
                    Then Sue Parsons became FLO director, and went out. Kathleen dropped out because
                    of problems she had with Sue Low, as did the pollster, Mr. Hursh-Cesar. That
                    left me and Sue Low.</p>
                <p>I had gathered a committee together to write this report. We were going to write
                    up the results of the questionnaire and then make recommendations. Meanwhile,
                    Sue Low had her idea for Foreign Service Associates, and the presidency of AAFSW
                    had changed hands, now in Molly Beyer's hands. Molly had really come in cold,
                    was unsure of all the background. I told Sue Low I felt that our committee
                    should write this report, and one of our recommendations can be “whatever your
                    idea is, of Foreign Service Associates.” Sue did not want to do that, saying she
                    couldn't write in a vacuum, and resigned as Forum chairman. I had thought the
                    committee would write the Report and submit it to Sue Low as Forum chairman to
                    revise, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): What vacuum was she writing in? You were giving
                        her a platform.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): That's right. She wanted it to be a separate
                        entity, in other words?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: She wanted to do it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): It would have been much more valid to come out
                        with a proposal based on the findings of this board.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: But it didn't. Her husband was over at FSI as Director and he was able
                    to help her. Do you have a copy of her report?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): I don't have her report but I have an article
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I'll get it for you, then you'll have the whole thing that he helped her
                    print. Plus Betty and Al Atherton helped her. He was Director General then. At
                    any rate, she had her political people lined up, and here I was with my little
                    committee, and no backing as usual.That's my problem. (laughter) So we slugged
                    it out. We had a deadline to get this thing printed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): So you were writing a paper that was a
                        summation —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: We divided up, into Education, and Community, and Children, and so
                    forth. Everybody wrote a section. Roz Mack did the one on Employment, (and Sue
                    Low was going to help her on that but backed out of that. too). I had worked
                    with the two Sues and Jean German on the Crisis report. That had been very, very
                    difficult, because we all had ideas, but it had to be written a certain way,
                    hammering out details such as commas, etc. as a group, and it's just very
                    difficult to work that way. So I said to each person on my committee, “you and
                    you and you write this and this and this, and then I will polish it all and put
                    it together.” That's what we did, and it worked very well. We had no problems
                    whatsoever.</p>
                <p>We got to the AAFSW board meeting for review of the Report, however, and Sue Low
                    had brought Betty Atherton and all these folks and they didn't like it because
                    it was “negative”, they said. We had put in comments about FLO, for instance,
                    that were negative responses from spouses. I said, “Well, what in the world was
                    the purpose of this anyway if you're not going to take the negative comments
                    from spouses overseas? What point is it?” Well, they wanted it to, kind of, be
                    more balanced, you know.So as a result Molly Beyer was really in a bind between
                    these two forces, and she said, “All right, we'll redo it, we'll go over it
                    again.” I thought I was going to faint, having spent 2-l/2 years on this thing.
                    If it hadn't been for Carol Sutherland who came forward and said, “I'll help
                    you,” it would not have been finished. (I had had LesleDorman and Elspeth Rostow
                    and numerous people on my committee who had computerized the Report, we had gone
                    over it with a fine-toothed comb, proofread it, and so forth ) Yet, to Sue Low
                    and Betty Atherton, it still wasn't the way they wanted it. And Sue was no
                    longer Forum chairman, and Betty was wife of the Director General, both with
                    powerful husbands to back them up!</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>So Carol and I did it, and we took, I would say, about three months. But in the
                    meantime the presses had stopped and I was very concerned that the State
                    Department would say, “Can't do it now for you, it's too late.” It was very
                    touch-and-go, but they did finally print it and sent it overseas everywhere. In
                    the meantime, the head of AAFSW changed again, to Pam Moffat. That was
                    unfortunate because she knew nothing of the background. Meanwhile Sue Low's
                    Foreign Service Associates had taken on a whole new ascendancy, and when our
                    Report came along I'm sure it was just overloading the circuits of the
                    Department of State. (laughter)</p>
                <p>I was so desperate, in the end I threw in a little portion saying we believed the
                    Department should consider something like Foreign Service Associates. You see, I
                    felt we had been overshadowed by the FSA proposal. I don't know the Foreign
                    Service Associates proposal thoroughly but I did attend the big sort of seminar
                    where they discussed, where we broke into various groups - - Career, etc. etc.
                    One of the groups was the wives who must do representation, and compensation
                    issues sort of thing. That is the one aspect, again, which even Sue Low has
                    backed away from because she felt it would destroy the whole rest of her
                    proposal. She wrote an article for Parade Magazin(Fenzi says she has a copy of
                    it) and you will see in it that that is the one issue they're backpedaling now,
                    they're trying to say “we don't really think spouses should be paid for that
                    kind of work.”</p>
                <p>It's just beyond me how it will ever be solved, really, at this point. Unless
                    ambassadors' wives are just given their freedom to do their own thing. That's
                    the only solution I see now. Because they'll never be paid, I don't believe,
                    because they don't ever want to be back in their husbands' efficiency reports.
                    So the whole spirit that we once knew of partnership and togetherness and the
                    same goals, I don't see it any more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): I don't see it either, Penne. But I do see
                        that they are going to, willy nilly, have to address the issue. Because now
                        that we are at 50% of the Service being single, those jobs of
                        representation, whether it's CODELS, whatever, [with heavy emphasis] still
                        has to be done.Somebody, (laughing) I hate to sound like the cartoon, but
                        somebody's gotta do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, my point is that I feel the wife definitely should NOT do it.
                    Betty Atherton's going to Egypt and having an office in the embassy, and she's
                    still not paid, and she's trying tprove her point. It didn't work. She worked
                    her tail off. But the only answer to making the Department see that it is a
                    viable position or role that should be compensated is for the wives not to do
                    it. (laughing)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): I take your point. All I was saying is that I
                        think they're going to have to address it because more and more I found at
                        my last post that I didn't have, essentially, any wives on the post! So they
                        are going to have to address the issue because the issue is there, now,
                        whether they like it or not.</hi>

                <p>LAINGEN: Well, I almost wished that Bruce had been appointed to another post, so
                    I could drop out. I was that ugly, that upset by the whole situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): I think women have done that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):Well, I think it also depends upon whatever
                        relationship you have with your husband and his approach. I can remember
                        even back about when the Directive came out or even before, because she'd
                        been doing this before, but I can remember when in Zambia, Ambassador
                        Troxel's wife, had no intention of doing anything about it; as a matter of
                        fact, she was off in Luwanda taking photographs with a crew that was doing a
                        documentary. We were only visitors, when four of us — Troxel, Wen Coote,
                        Larry and myself — drove in a car over the Great North Road, 1,000 miles or
                        whatever, from Dar es Salaam to Lusaka. It was a never to be forgotten ride,
                        considered at that point to be Hell's Run. We got back to find that Holly,
                        the ambassador's wife, wasn't there, but it waperfectly understood between
                        Trox and his wife. As long as you come to some agreement that way, that's
                        fine. But it seems to me the basic point is that those functions are still
                        going to have to be carried on whether the Department decides it's going to
                        pay somebody, whether the spouse, the nuns down at the nearest convent who
                        bring in hors d'oeuvres, or whoever...it's going to get to that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): You know who's doing it? This has come up in at
                        least one of our interviews. At this point it's the spouses of the
                        subordinate officers, who are ambitious and want to make brownie points with
                        their husbands' superiors...the next level — wives of the Political and
                        Economic Officers just below DCM — are the ones doing it because their
                        husbands are career oriented. You didn't find that?</hi>

                        it comes from the top.</hi>

                <p>

                        (Williamson): Yes, those are both factors in this situation. But I did not
                        find that at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: So much now, today, depends on the CLO. Neither of us had that, of
                    course. But I feel if that is well organized at post, then there shouldn't be
                    any of these problems, really. Wives should be able to be free to do their own
                    thing.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things arising from the l985 Spouse Report was that a
                    majority of people at post felt an ambassador's wife should take a leadership
                    role in the community. That really opened my eyes! So they weren't just
                    complaining in a vacuum, they felt these expectations all around them. Their
                    morale was low, because they knew that the majority of people at post think they
                    should behave a certain way despite the Directive. One interesting comment I
                    recall seeing concerned an ambassador whose wife was an officer. She said that
                    if he became an ambassador she would look for another post, because she would
                    never serve as his wife, but he said an ambassador's wife should take a
                    leadership role at post. So, a number of interesting comments came from this
                    questionnaire. Now, five years later, I don't know how useful it's been. I've
                    seen it quoted here and there. But when you get down to really the reality of
                    the situation, no matter how much FLO does, no matter how many reports we write,
                    the society moves, by itself, in a certain direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): And the Foreign Service is part of it. Yet why
                        wasn't the FSA proposal attached to the Report as the recommendation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, I don't want to get into the reasons -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Unless they're just personal, then there's no
                        point in getting into the reason.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: My theory of why it was is because she [Sue Low] wanted to write her
                    proposal on her own. She didn't want to cooperate —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Then if it's personal we shouldn't go into it
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:But I can see no other reason why she dropped out of it. Also, I was
                    adamant that the spouse committee write it; that was the other thing. I didn't
                    want to repeat what we'd gone through in the Crisis Report, where four of us sat
                    around nitpicking about this comma and that comma — I thought I cannot do that
                    again. Or if you'd have a suggestion, and they'd say “No! That's not the way
                    it's going to be.” You know, you feel you're wasting your time. So I set it up
                    where each person wrote her own section and then we got together and someone
                    would say, “where did you get that statistic? Are you sure?” “Absolutely.” We
                    backed it up that way. But we did not spend endless hours nitpicking the paper
                    to death. Then, later, Carol Sutherland and I were put on the spot —</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): What was Carol doing at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: She was head of the Forum. She had a job downtown so we could use the
                    computer in her office. I just really was deeply grateful to her, because it
                    showed the kind of cooperative, open spirit to make it possible for us to get
                    this done. You see, we had the Cox Foundation grant and were indebted to them,
                    obligated to come out with something. And we also had Mr. Hursh-Cesar's
                    statistical report, which I have, where anyone questioning the statistics could
                    access. We, of course, looked over his report and wrote ours from his. We also
                    made a point in this l985 report that because so many people had returned their
                    questionnaires with comments that were so well said and pertinent that we
                    decided to use those quotations —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):Oh, yes. And I remember being very pleasantly
                        surprised at how many people had responded to the questionnaire, which was
                        far in excess of the normal percentage of returns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Exactly. As I say, I don't know how much is pertinent today. Then on the
                    Cox Foundation money, we also disseminated the Report and questionnaire to AID
                    and USIS spouses, who were very interested in this and gave us a lot of input.
                    CIA spouses weren't allowed to participate — which caused me to think I wouldn't
                    be a CIA spouse for anything in the worl(all three laugh) the way they're
                    treated!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Well, there are compensations, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I'm sure there are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): (laughing) I know there are. Financially,
                        certainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi):(laughing) I had a question to come back to: The
                        $30,000 from the Cox Foundation. How was that divided up, how used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Mostly it went to, I threw out the papers later, I can't tell you the
                    percentages, but a great deal went to Mr. Hursh-Cesar for his statistical
                    analysis. Of course there was printing. The Department paid for dissemination of
                    the questionnaire, but the Cox Foundation paid for mailinthe report
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): You didn't get a stipend for administering

                <p>LAINGEN: Oh, no. The Report came through AAFSW—a volunteer organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi):A certain portion of the $30,000 should have been
                        written into the budget for administration. Today, one would just say
                        “mpercentage to do this will be such-and-such.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: No, that never occurred to us, never occurred to us. (laughing) How
                    stupid we were. We didn't, even, ask for travel or expenses or anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Well, maybe we've come that far in five years, but
                        today my first response would be “well, is this going to be enough to pay
                        the administrative costs of — “</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, I tell you, today I wouldn't do this again. The thing is, it was
                    after the hostage crisis. The homecoming and aftermath was in many ways more
                    difficult than during, if you can believe it — the adjustments, and what job is
                    Bruce going to get, and I don't want to go overseas. It was really a very
                    stressful, difficult time. When I hear now of people who have been depressed, I
                    realize I went through a terrible depression. I would sit out at the end of Fort
                    McNair and stare at the water. I didn't want to jump in, I wasn't at that point,
                    but I was at such a crossroads of my own life — what I wanted to do. I did not
                    want the Foreign Service any more, it had mistreated me, used me, maligned me,
                    taken my husband overseas and put him in danger, hadn't supported me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): You'd had it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: And then here was Bruce not knowing — he was talking of running for the
                    Senate, I didn't want him to, I thought that was a terrible idea. It was just an
                    awful time. So I sort of grabbed onto this project as something to do, really,
                    just to get it off my chest. And find out if I was the only one, or were there
                    others. It was kind of therapy for me. Today, since Bruce has retired, and I am
                    able to do my own thing, I'm almost callous, now, but happy.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In the beginning when I went into this period of assessment about spouses in the
                    Foreign Service, even in that first meeting with Macomber, we found that
                    everybody was unhappy: the singles were unhappy ; the senior wives were
                    overbearing; the junior wives were unhappy. So here it was, a lot later, l988, I
                    think. Bruce had just retired, and I got a call from Marguerite Cooper. I could
                    have died laughing! She's just been given an award of some money for something
                    that she did. So she's all excited and is organizing this group of Foreign
                    Service families. “I want you to be on the Board,” she said. “You know, it's
                    just really fantastic what we have found. The singles are unhappy, the older
                    wives are overbearing, the junior wives are unhappy — “ (they all break up,
                    hilarious) And I said, “THANK YOU, NO, MARGUERITE.” (more laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): “I've just run full circle.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Isn't it incredible? That was in l97l, and here she's calling me in
                    l988. And I said, “You're on your own, kiddo. Because I have had it, from
                    sticking my head out in l978 and l985.” So that is the saga. And I've got all
                    this printed stuff for your files.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): I first met you in the midst of all that turmoil,
                        and not having known any of the history, I have to be very frank with you.
                        There were times I would think, well, where are you coming from? Now that I
                        know a great deal more about the history of all of this, I can see your
                        frustration at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): At each juncture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: There was talk that, first of all, they would psychoanalyze the hostages
                    and their families and counsel them and help them and so forth. That was very
                    sparse. Eventually for some reason the Department totally dropped all the
                    analysis of the hostage crisis, the psychological — they were going to do some
                    sort of study of the families and see how they'd turned out and follow us. You
                    know, after the Vietnam War, for years the POWs were taking physicals and being
                    observed. Once a year they automatically went to their medical facilities and
                    were examined physically and psychologically.</p>
                <p>So here we were, a group of real good guinea pigs, and they were going to do the
                    same. I believe it was the change of administration, that Reagan wanted to sweep
                    the hostage situation under the rug and totally forget it. I'll never forget,
                    when we went to the Department where all the hostages were to receive the Medal
                    of Valor, they were seated on the stage. General Haig entered and said, “Here,
                    Bruce, you come over here, I'll give you your Medal, the rest of you can pick up
                    your Medal in Room 1708.” (gasps from F and W) It was that callous.</p>

                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): (exhaling strong breath) — it's
                        outrageous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:It was, it was absolutely outrageous, but that is what happened. I think
                    if you were to interview people like Marian Precht, wife of FSO Henry Precht,
                    who had been working on the Iran Task Force, you would see that this group had
                    set up all the plans for the Homecoming. After Reagan won the election, however,
                    the plans were totally upset by the new people who came in. They weren't going
                    to do this, or that —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): What were the changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: If Jimmy Carter had still been in the White House, I think there would
                    have been tremendous celebrations in the White House — a big dinner party, or
                    who knows, but it would have gone on and on, I'm sure. There would have been
                    better career possibilities for the hostages. Reagan wanted to just get them in
                    — we did have a big tea party at the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Wasn't there a procession from Union Station
                        or somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Oh, yes, from Andrews Air Force Base. We flew in from West Point. That
                    was absolutely fantastic. Bruce and I were on the bus with George and Barbara
                    Bush, they were our escorts. And the bus window had that very dark glass that
                    prevents those outside from seeing in. Bruce asked Mrs. Bush for some lipstick
                    and wrote a big THANK YOU and put it up against the window. A few weeks later we
                    got the sign in the mail from Barbara Bush, saying, “I thought you'd want this
                    for your scrapbook.”</p>
                <p>Well, the homecoming was fine, but it was definitely changed by the new
                    administration's desire to have it over with, let's be done with this. Anyway, I
                    think that had to do with the State Department's later decision not to pursue us
                    any further on lessons learned. I thought, even though there were many things
                    the Department did right by us families, there was still a lot they should know
                    they should not have done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Well, one can always learn from any
                        situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, one would think so, but they were not interested in what we
                    spouses or family members had to say. Until along comes Jean German, and I think
                    this is a fantastic woman because she was the first one to say to me, “I want to
                    hear what you have to say.” At that time she was in AAFSW, and we wrote the
                    Crisis Report, which would not have come about without Jean German. Because she
                    and Fanchon Silberstein, who was head of the OBC at that time, those two saw
                    that there was much to be learned. Eventually Jean became the deputy to Fanchon
                    at OBC, and called in Wallapa Tomseth and Marge German and various wives to sit
                    down and talk about the crisis, how it was handled for the families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):Excuse me, Penne, wasn't Ginny Taylor the
                        first crisis counselor, or whatever we call it in FLO now — her first job in
                        FLO, if I remember correctly, was head of Crises — what did we call it? It
                        had a different title.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: She was, but you see the thing was, FLO became a part of State
                    Department, under Management. Therefore Ginny was very much a part of that. She
                    was with us all through the hostage crisis, but Marian Precht was head of this
                    Iran Working Group (IWG). (FLO was told not to interfere in the IWG's work, so
                    Ginny Taylor did not handle us directly. This was done by volunteer spouses. I
                    don't know if you want me to go into that phase...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): I think that Joan and I having been CLOs, can
                        appreciate Ginny's position. She had to work with Management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Oh, you do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi):She had to keep her channels open to the —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson):Of course. I was only trying to gain
                        perspective on when Ginny was, as was my understanding, the first one in an
                        established crisis position whatever they were calling it — trying to pin
                        down the year in relation to our discussion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: What I'm saying is that she was long gone by the time the crisis was
                    over. Therefore, she was not in OBC; that was Jean German and Fanchon
                    Silberstein. To resume, the State Department did not want to hear what we had to
                    say. It was only when Jean and Fanchon saw that they might learn from us, that
                    they called us in saying, “Let's write a Crisis Report”. That's how that came
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Did they then turn that over to FLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LAINGEN:Well yes, they gave it to the Department, and on that particularly their
                    criticism of the Medical Division. Medical was very unhappy with the comments
                    and for a long time sat on their papers. Eventually in the Crisis Report I think
                    we kind of softened that part of it down because they were very upset by some of
                    the recommendations. I have never known — you'll have to ask Sue Low or Sue
                    Parsons — what happened to the Crisis Report recommendations. Whether FLO
                    incorporated them and pushed them — probably so, because Sue Parsons was then
                    in, but I never knew what became of that report.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Jean German became head of OBC and was very much interested in new
                    programs on the handling of families in crisis. She had me write a report,
                    called “Living in a Stressful World.” I'll give you a copy for your files, and
                    also these letters which you can photocopy, which I think go along with it.
                    They're saying, to give one example: “Congratulations on a fine and monumental
                    piece of work. I want you to know that even though I was reading it as an
                    editor, it held my interest throughout. I learned a lot. You are providing
                    important information and support for your reader.” That was signed “Sarah.” And
                    a letter from overseas, John Spitzer, in AID: “One of our employees stationed in
                    Yemen recently told me that the FLO mailing on “Parenting in a Stressful World”
                    had reached them just before the embassy communicator was shot last month. He
                    went on to say how helpful it had been to the parents in Sanaa. Apparently, the
                    children in Yemen exhibited many of the same behavior changes covered in the
                    article. The parents, however, knew what symptoms to look for and how to react
                    to these emerging patterns.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Oh, terrific.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: There was another one, something from Marcia Curran. I think it's very
                    interesting that that report was a success. Then I did a few other things for
                    Marilyn Holmes, in her video, on the handling of families in crisis situations.
                    I do believe that OBC has a better handle on it now than the State Department. I
                    did hear through the years from various hostage families, who say, “Well, the
                    Department calls us, but they're so callous,” they're so this, or that. We heard
                    it with the PanAm l03 families and the Beirut hostage families, how the State
                    Department would say, “We've got your child's body here. Come down and get it.”
                    They were so callous.</p>
                <p>Now, with this latest crisis in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, I saw the other day
                    they've got, I believe, 40 people telephoning every day 3,000 family members.
                    It's an incredible task. I said to Bruce, I wonder if I should volunteer and go
                    down and talk to these folks. Because when you've had an experience, you are
                    more valuable than people who have not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Sure. You're more in tune to their feelings.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: Then I thought, no, I won't do tha(half-apologetic laugh). Well, I would
                    if they called me. But to just volunteer, I don't think they really want the
                    spouses to come in any more.Betty Atherton did it, but... my feeling is they
                    just would rather bumble along the way they do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): But you know we've come a long way. Here again, to
                        fall back on one of our interviews, I don't remember when the crisis in
                        Santo Domingo was, it must have been either late 1950s or early 60s, but the
                        ambassador's wife left when there was “a crisis.” It occurred to her later
                        that maybe she should have done something about the staff, but her rationale
                        was that you don't rock the Department's boat. So she came home and just
                        left the families there. During her interview, she said, “You know, one
                        thing I did do.” She had seen Louisa Kennedy on television. “I invited her
                        to tea because I wanted to know what went on in her mind that made that
                        group realize something should be done to help these people.” So we've come
                        a long way in the last 25-30 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, I'm not so sure we have come a long way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): But her reaction, Penne, was that you didn't do
                        anything about a crisis because you didn't want to confront State Department
                        tradition. And that's not all that long ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:Oh, well, I see — you mean we've come a long way in rocking the boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:Could be. But you know yourself, the generation or two before ours, the
                    Cabots and their ilk, didn't think of the State Department as at all a social
                    organization to take care of everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): Oh, no, of course not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: In fact, (laughing) they hardly got paid, some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): See, they didn't need the salary, they didn't need
                        a support system, because they were quite accustomed to taking care of
                        themselves financially. And traveling — they were sophisticated before they
                        ever got to the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LAINGEN: But what worries me today is that instead of becoming more caring, we
                    really are becoming less caring. We are becoming media conscious, so that we
                    have all these videos that we show and this and that. But the personal hands-on
                    contacts, I wonder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): But doesn't that reflect society in
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: It does, exactly, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Fenzi): And that's because there are more people.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Not necessarily. I don't think it's ipso
                        facto because there's more people, I think that just in general it seems to
                        me it's partly a carry over from this whole period of either what's in it
                        for me or I've got mine. I'm deliberately staying away from calling it the
                        me generation as such. But this whole emphasis on I've got mine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN:Speaking of that, when I got back from Malta I went to a career
                    counseling course, not because I was going to start a career, but because I
                    really wanted to know what was going on with women and listen to the attitudes
                    in the Service. I've put that in the Georgetown Symposium essay. My reaction was
                    that the State Department was financing this woman to come in and tell you how
                    to get a career to get you away from the Foreign Service, and it seemed to me
                    that it was kind of ludicrous that the Department would pay for teaching women
                    how to break away, instead of bringing you back, finding ways to recall your
                    sense of allegiance.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this one exercise I will never forget. The teacher said, “Now,” and she
                    drew a big rectangle on the blackboard, “this is your conference table, this is
                    your life, and I want you to put around this conference table your board of
                    directors, who runs your meetings, who runs your life.” So I immediately went
                    right to work. “That's easy.” I put my husband at one end and his career at the
                    other. (laughter) And then I put my three sons on the side, and my parents and
                    my activities were on the other side, as well as the pets and all the
                    obligations I had to the church, and whatever.</p>
                <p>The teacher came by my desk and whipped it off like I was perfectly made for her.
                    She took my exercise to the blackboard. “Now you see how your life is totally
                    run by everybody but you,” she said. “My rectangle is here and at the end I have
                    a tremendous circle and I am at the head of the table. And that's all there is.”
                    I remember being just devastated, going home, and realizing I was not in control
                    of my life at all. I said, “that's my life, I'm lying right there on the middle
                    of that table.” (laughing) You can see the tremendous psychological upheaval
                    that I have gone through just being called a sadomasochist and that I want to
                    victimize junior wives.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Well, it all came at one time, Penne. It was
                        a one-two punch. You'd come back from Malta, then with all this business
                        with Bruce, with the hostage situation, it was all as if you were got in the
                        ring and were going to ten rounds, and about the fifth round you realize(she
                        laughs) “what on earth am I doing here and how do I get out of here?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: And you can imagine, I mean, to look at the Directive that says “you're
                    free to be your own person.” I mean, they've got to be kidding, they've got to
                    be!”Now, maybe neither of you had that experience, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Which experience? (hearty laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: I mean the psychological. Maybe some people do feel free to be the “me”
                    at the head of the conference table, but I don't frankly think, Foreign Service
                    or not, that any of us can go through life totally without some other things
                    coming into it. I mean, if you have children, don't they figure somewhat?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): I must say I have seen, for lack of a more
                        convenient word, I've seen some totally selfish spouses in the last seven,
                        eight, ten years in the Foreign Service. Totally. And they would conform to
                        your feeling — no, the only thing was they did have a little regret on
                        leaving post because it would mean that they wouldn't get to travel quite as
                        much. But they hadn't been on post anyway because they were too busy doing
                        their job back here with their separate allowance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, of course, I think we forget the men in this situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: Well, some women who want to be their own person are demanding that the
                    men pitch in, let's say, with the housekeeping and child care. I'm not saying
                    they shouldn't, but it tends to make men look like they've been totally
                    self-centered, totally selfish, when really, men are not. Men have had all the
                    responsibility, not only for their career but for their families — the financial
                    care of the family, and many men take care of the garden, of the car, the
                    furnace. I mean, I don't see why mopping the floor, let's say, (it's a job that
                    nobody likes) but — how shall I say this? — I don't think men have been as
                    selfish as women have made them out to be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): Well, that's been this whole problem with
                        this whole feminist movement and why the pendulum continues to swing back
                        and forth. It seems to me there was an over reaction, there was a stridency
                        and too strong a position taken in the beginning which has caused, in our
                        society in general, people to draw back to a certain degree, or at least
                        reexamine the positions that were taken in the forefront of this feminist
                        movement or the “now” or whatever you want to call it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAINGEN: And the pitiable part is a perception that women who want to take care
                    of their children or stay home is a “stupid thing to do.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q (Williamson): It's perceived as worthless because no
