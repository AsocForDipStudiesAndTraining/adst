                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Suppose we begin by you telling us about your education
                        and what interested you in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Thanks, Tom, I'll be glad to. I was one of two daughters in a family of
                    four. I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. I went to both elementary and high school
                    in Memphis, graduated from high school there. I went on to earn my college
                    degree at what was then called Southwestern at Memphis, a
                    Presbyterian-affiliated small liberal arts college which has since changed its
                    name to Rhodes College. I received my BA with honors in international studies. I
                    graduated in 1964 and then went on to graduate school. I wanted to continue to
                    study international affairs, politics, foreign relations. That interest made me
                    want to come to Washington to do graduate work. So I thought well, I will go to
                    whichever graduate school, be it Georgetown School of Foreign Service or Johns
                    Hopkins SAIS (School of Advanced International Studies) offers me the bigger
                    scholarship. As it turns out, I was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship so I had
                    to make the decision where to go and I choose SAIS. Theirs was a two-year
                    program, Masters in International Studies. I spent the first year here in
                    Washington and the second year at the Bologna Center in Bologna, Italy. So
                    that's my education, bachelor's degree and the masters.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In terms of what interested me in the Foreign Service, to begin with I think, two
                    things. First, I've always been more oriented towards the social sciences. When
                    I was in high school, it was history, language, be it Spanish or French, English
                    that I preferred over hard sciences and math. I remember also that I came to New
                    Jersey when I was only about 14 years olmy first plane flight! — I came up to
                    spend the summer with my aunt, uncle, and three cousins. They lived right
                    outside New York City in northern New Jersey. We went, of course, into the city
                    to see everything including the United Nations. I remember just being
                    fascinated, particularly by the interpreters and even the guides that showed us
                    around. So that was my first early experience. But what really got me interested
                    in the idea of living abroad as opposed to just traveling abroad occurred when I
                    was at Southwestern. The college offered a junior year abroad program; I went
                    and spent my junior year in France, lived with a French family. It was the
                    French experience that fostered a deep interest. And within three yearin 1965 —
                    I was able to follow that up with a second year abroad, in Bologna as part of
                    the SAIS program. So those were the things that brought me to the Foreign
                    Service — the personal experiences of living abroad and my the interest in
                    politics and international trade and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you decide to take the examination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I found out there was a Foreign Service — I hadn't even heard of it, my
                    father was in business — when I was at Southwestern. My American history
                    professor told me about it. I took the written exam in my senior year. I passed
                    it and went on to the oral in Washington the first fall at SAIS. I did not pass,
                    which was not a great tragedy since fortunately, I was in graduate school. But,
                    as you know, if you flunk anywhere along the way, you have to start the whole
                    process over. So when I was in Italy, the second year of the masters' program,
                    spring of 1966, I retook the written exam at the Consulate General in Florence,
                    not far from Bologna. I again passed it and took the oral the summer of '66
                    after I returned to Washington. I passed the oral the second time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congratulations! I note from your bio that you spent some
                        time at the Department of Agriculture. How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: That worked out very well. As I just said, I passed the oral in the
                    summer of 1966 and was all ready to start work and the Foreign Service panel
                    said “Oh, but wait there're a few other steps. First, you have to undergo a
                    background investigation. You've lived in Europe twice, you've traveled to the
                    Soviet Union, behind the Iron Curtain to Moscow and so on. That investigation
                    will take awhile. And then there's a required medical exam, which shouldn't be a
                    problem at your age. Finally there's a question of budget, whether we'll
                    actually be hiring you at all.”</p>
                <p>So then I said “What do I do in the meantime?” And they said “You go out and get
                    a job.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Fortunately, I had alternative interviews lined up, including one at Agriculture.
                    So I kept my appointment with this wonderful person, my real first boss, whose
                    name was Jim Howard. He knew my situation, that I was taking the Foreign Service
                    oral and that I had taken it the day before. And he said “How did it go?” I said
                    “I passed.” And he said “why are you sitting here?” I said “I need a job” and I
                    explained that it would be at least a year before State could, maybe, take me
                    on. He explained what I would do for the Foreign Marketing Service, in his
                    office. We had this discussion that, if I would agree to stay with him for a
                    year, I could have the job. During that year he would try to convince me to stay
                    on and become, perhaps, an officer in the Foreign Agricultural Service,
                    Agriculture's own “Foreign Service”. So that's how I ended up at Agriculture. He
                    was wonderful and he understood why I chose to move othe challenge of greater
                    growth. So I did move, in the fall of '67 over to State. He and his wife even
                    invited me and my parents out to his home in Virginia for a celebratory drink
                    when they came to Washington for my swearing in at State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a rather indelicate question. Did you feel any
                        sense of discrimination, as a woman, in government service, either at
                        Agriculture or State, back in the Sixties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Only from my first oral panethree white mein the fall of 1964. They
                    assumed I would be in for a “short ride” until the best marriage offer came
                    along. Other than that, I had very good bosses. Most of them were men; I had
                    only one woman boss — there weren't many women officers in the Service those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you were called to enter the Foreign Service,
                        in I believe October 1967, and you entered with a large class of people, the
                        A-100 class. How did you find that? Helpful or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: You mean the class? Well, I enjoyed meeting my various colleagues from
                    different parts of the country and varying backgrounds. I think all in all it
                    was very good preparation and quite necessary for what we were about to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got your first assignment, which I had something
                        to do with. You went to Sydney, Australia. Was that a surprise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MEYERS: That was a surprise, because frankly I was hoping for a posting to
                    Europe. I'd studied in Europe twice, lived there two years. I knew I liked it. I
                    was willing to serve anywhere from Helsinki south to the Mediterranean. I
                    thought my French — I entered with fluent French, rated three, three plus I
                    believe, would help in that regard. So when I got Sydney, I was surprised. The
                    assignments were very dramatically done. All of us junior officers were seated
                    in the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) auditorium. Then our administrators
                    called us up one by one, to get our certificates. As you walked up they said
                    “And congratulations, you're going to X or Y.” One woman, I believe she was a
                    USIS officer, was told “You're going to Lahore!”, which, of course, is in
                    Pakistan. And she had never heard of this place, so as she walked back to her
                    seat she very carefully studied the regional maps on the wall, drawing chuckles
                    from the crowd. When they said Sydney, I did know where it was, but it was a
                    surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Sydney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No surprise, I was assigned to the consular section. I think almost all
                    first tour officers, at least then and I think still now, pull consular
                    assignments as their first duty. It was quite a small section. There was a
                    senior consular officer and two junior vice consuls, and I was one of the two.
                    We handled, the three of us, all consular work — American citizens services work
                    — as well as visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sense of rotation at the Consulate General,
                        where junior officers were moved from one section, consular or
                        administrative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, not in our Consulate General. The only thing we did was to switch
                    between non-immigrant and immigrant visas. The senior consular officer handled
                    ACS (American Citizen Services) and the two junior consular officers rotated
                    between immigrant and non-immigrant visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Few really. I think the biggest problem I had personally was my
                    supervisor, the senior consular officer, not the first but the second one. As
                    you probably know from your own experience, consular work never stops; it can be
                    24/7. And unfortunately, that's the way this woman dealt with it. She was
                    obsessed with work and gave it her all. My problem came when I wanted to take
                    three weeks off in summer 1969 to fly home to be in my sister's wedding. My
                    leave was refused. I cut the request to two weeks but it still was no go. To be
                    fair to her, there had been a significant change in the immigrant visa law so we
                    were trying to process a lot of immigrant visas before the new regulations
                    became effective the end of June. But I still maintain that the job could have
                    been done and handled and I regret deeply that I wasn't in my sister's wedding.
                    I appealed to the Consul General. He was about to okay my leave when my boss
                    collapsed in a flood of tears in his office and he backed down. I was a junior
                    officer. I was very inexperienced and respectful. I think a few years further
                    along I would have said “Well, tough luck, I'm out of here; I will be back and I
                    trust you can manage without little me in the meantime.” I didn't do it then; I
                    didn't have guts enough. That was the biggest problem I encountered. But you see
                    how vividly I remember it even now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand perfectly. Did the Ambassador visit the post
                        often or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No. He came down a few times. Again, there was a change in ambassadors
                    during the two years I was there. There's something nice I recall. There was a
                    political officer in Embassy Canberra, who handled labor affairs, John Dorrance.
                    He sensed somehow that I was eager to do more. When occasionally he came to have
                    lunch with a labor leader or someone based in Sydney, he would usually call up
                    to see if I wanted to join them if I could get away. Maybe this just happened
                    two or three times in the two years. But it was a great brightener for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to go up to the Embassy often?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MEYERS: No, consular work was a full-time job and it was concentrated in Sydney.
                    Of course, as a junior officer, you are so very dependent on your national
                    staff, because they know the rules and regulations and all the ins and outs. Our
                    senior consular clerk was terrific. We had some tough times in immigration. The
                    Vietnam War was still going full bore and a large R&amp;R program had been set
                    up to bring young Americans to Sydney for five days R&amp;R. A full 747 flew in
                    three to four times a week. The Australians were terrific hosts, inviting these
                    young men to everything from sailing on Sydney harbor to weekend stays on sheep
                    stations, etc. It was wonderful. Australia became the most popular R&amp;R
                    destination after Hawaii. These visits also quickly generated , no surprise,
                    romances. And after four short days together, many a young couple turned up on
                    our doorstep wanting to get married or to go to the States to get married.. And
                    back then the fianc�e visa didn't exist. So we had several young couples who
                    were sorely disappointed. And Joan, our senior consular clerk, would try to
                    explain the regulations at the visa counter and then would come back to me and
                    say “Miss Meyers, that American chap doesn't want to hear it from me. I'm
                    female. I'm Australian. He wants to hear it from an officer. So you're going to
                    have to speak with him.” And I'd say “Okay now, what is it I need to say?” And
                    she would brief me very quickly on the points I had to make and then out I would
                    go. Usually, the face fell as I approached (another woman!!) but at least I was
                    an officer and I was an American; he didn't have to deal with an Australian. So
                    that was a tough situatiofor them, for us. And we got a fair share of irate
                    calls from distressed Aussie fathers and annoyed Parliamentarians. Then,
                    eventually, a fianc�e visa was created about the time we left Vietnam.</p>

                <p>MEYERS: No, we did not have any military bases or troops stationed there.</p>

                <p>MEYERS: Yes, a monitoring station for NASA. When I was there the first landing on
                    the moon, Apollo 11, took place. The Australians were every bit as proud and
                    happy and excited as we were. It was wonderful watching the landing on that tiny

                <p>MEYERS: At that time, no. We had a Commercial Section but it was all State
                    because the separate Foreign Commercial Service of the Commerce Department came
                    later. We had the U.S. Information Service (USIS) and U.S. Travel Service, part
                    of Commerce, in separate locations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Not much. Any traveling I did was on my own ticket. I did get to the
                    Outback on vacation. A friend from California came for a few weeks. We flew to
                    Adelaide and then rode a bus north to Ayers Rock and Alice Springs. We stopped
                    overnight in Coober Pedy where white opals are mined. The trip to Ayers Rock
                    took almost a weemainly over unpaved roads. I also went down to Tasmania. I met
                    a couple of women when we were on the trip up to Ayers Rock who were from
                    Launceston in Tasmania. So I went down and spent a couple of days with them.
                    Tasmania is the smallest of the states. Sometimes you even find maps or drawings
                    of Australia where Tasmania has been left off completely. Of course, the 400,000
                    people who come from Tasmania are quite upset by that!</p>

                <p>MEYERS: I can't recall actually doing any. I was in the Junior
                    Australian-American Association, which is how I made some of my Aussie friends.
                    But I don't recall any speechmaking.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I would say no. The war in Vietnam was grinding on and the Australians
                    were in there with us. They had made the decision to go in and stay, which of
                    course we appreciated very much. But I don't think moving from one
                    administration to another really had much effect on our relations.</p>

                    wanted to come back to Washington. My father was quite ill and I wanted to be in
                    the States. I felt the econ course would add a lot to my knowledge and round me

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I'd say yes. I think it's always important, even if you're not dealing
                    directly with macro policy and micro policy and statistics to have a good
                    grounding in econ which is helpful if you will be dealing with trade issues and
                    the like. So, yes, I think it was worthwhile and was helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was followed in 1970 by your assignment to the Bureau
                        of African Affairs, North Africa (AF/N), I believe, as an economic officer,
                        which was suitable. Had you asked for that or was this just an assignment
                        that came to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: That was an assignment that came to me. The African bureau was divided
                    into regional or country groupings and each had an economic officer responsible
                    for the economic/trade issues of that whole office. The “country” or “desk”
                    officers focused on political and political- military issues etc. But the
                    separation out of econ made little sense. There is no way, for example, that you
                    could be “country” officer for Libya and not deal with the oil issue. When I
                    came aboard in June 1970, we were being forced out of Wheelus Air Force Base.
                    King Idris had just been overthrown the previous September by Qadhafi, who is
                    still there. To take oil out of this bigger picture is really nonsense.
                    Obviously, oil, oil exports, the ramifications of nationalization of U.S.
                    companies assets, etc., would be an integral part of the Libyan country
                    officer's job. So at best I was sort of a backup, trailing after more
                    experienced, highly motivated officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far did your mandate extend? It didn't include Egypt,
                        did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No. Egypt belonged to the Near East Asia Bureau (NEA). The office of
                    North African Affairs ran from Libya west to Mauritania. It also included Sudan.
                    I did the regional econ work for about a year. My boss was very perceptive and
                    good with his officers. He saw that I was at loose ends, not really fully
                    occupied. We had a two month gap on the Tunisia desk and he asked me to cover
                    it. And than a longer opportunity — to cover the Mauritania/Sudan desk — arose.
                    So I became the Mauritania-Sudan desk officer for almost a year. So I got my
                    “desk”. Perhaps it wasn't as important as Libya, Algeria or Morocco but it was
                    mine and a big step up for me.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, I did. In February 1972 I made an orientation trip to both
                    Mauritania and Sudan. I remember saying to Jim Blake, my boss, “You know, I'll
                    be rotating out of this job this summer. Obviously I'd love to go because I'll
                    learn a great deal and still have four or five months to go but I don't know if
                    we can justify the trip.” And he said “Yes, you should go.” And I did and I saw
                    and learned a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good! Were we encouraging economic integration among
                        the North African countries in those days? Europe was beginning to coalesce.

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I don't believe so. Certainly nothing was going on in AF/N. We were fully
                    occupied just handling the events of each dacrises and protocol such as a visit
                    by the Sudanese Foreign Minister. We had no formal diplomatic relations with
                    Sudan as they had been broken off after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. However, we
                    were attempting to get relations on a better track and trying to make an
                    appointment for the Sudanese foreign minister with Secretary of State Rogers.
                    Well, the Sudanese foreign minister didn't want to see Mr. Rogers. No, he wanted
                    to see Henry Kissinger in the White House. And I remember turning to somebody
                    and asking, “Who is this Henry Kissinger in the White House?” The minister did
                    get to see Mr. Rogers but I don't believe he got over to the White House to see
                    Mr. Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did senior officials in the Department and in the White

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, they did. One of the senior Department officials interested was
                    Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, David Newsom. David Newsom, before his
                    recent return to Washington, had been Ambassador to Libya. He later moved
                    upstairs to be Undersecretary for Political Affairs. And Libya had oil and
                    Algeria, gas, and these assets were being nationalized by radical governments.
                    And besides these countries, we still worked closely with conservative
                    regimeTunisia under Bourguiba and Morocco under King Hassan II. Yes, we had the
                    attention of State's seventh floor and some in the White House.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much to do with the UN Economic Commission for

                <p>MEYERS: Not that I can recall. I certainly didn't. It doesn't come to mind.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any congressional visits that sparked interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MEYERS: I don't believe so, no. But there was a memorable visit to this country I
                    handled. You'll recall I covered the Tunisia desk for a few months. Right over
                    the Christmas/New Year holiday period, 1970-1971, Tunisian President Bourguiba,
                    became critically ill and it was decided to medevac him by U.S. military
                    aircraft to the United States, to Walter Reed Hospital for evaluation and
                    possible treatment. And so, as desk officer, I coordinated that effort which was
                    amazing. I contacted and dealt with offices and people I never knew existed. To
                    Jim Blake's credit, he left me in charge providing guidance as needed. Once the
                    flight arrived here it was to land at Andrews Air Force Base just outside
                    Washington. But at the last minute the landing was shifted to Dulles. Something
                    about the wind direction. So we had to redirect the whole welcoming entourage,
                    including the Tunisian ambassador, Assistant Secretary Newsom, the Secret
                    Service, etc., to Dulles. And then there was the helicopter. Bourguiba was to be
                    ferried from Dulles to Walter Reed by helicopter. But they were late and it was
                    now dark. Did the landing pad at Walter Reed have sufficient lighting for a safe
                    landing, etc., etc.? In the end, it all worked and I went home much relieved.
                    And then the phone rang. It was the head of the security detail assigned to
                    cover Bourguiba. And he said “Marilyn” — I think his name was Bob Lemon, I still
                    remember his name — “I'm calling to let you know he just left.” And I said
                    “What?” “Yes, Bourguiba's just left the hospital.” And I said “Really!? Was he
                    supposed to do that? Where did he go?” And he said, “I don't know, I've got this
                    address.” And he read me this address and I said “That's the Ambassador's
                    residence.” Apparently President Bourguiba felt pretty good and decided, after
                    two hours in the hospital, to “bag it,” got dressed and went to the
                    ambassador's. So Bob said, “I'm hanging up and moving my guys down there right
                    now.” It was a bitterly cold January nighI forgot to mention the snowstorm of a
                    few days before! and the Secret Service detail was stuck in the driveway,
                    protecting the residence. I immediately called my boss and he informed Mr.
                    Newsom. The two decided just to leave him at the Ambassador's for the night and
                    try to talk him into going back to the hospital the next day, which is what
                    happened.. I think actually the Tunisian ambassador invited them (the security
                    detail) into the house to get warm. And when the midnight shift arrived, he
                    wouldn't let those inside leave. He gave them pajamas and toothbrushes so a
                    couple of them ended up spending the night in the residence while the midnight
                    shift paced the driveway in the frigid cold!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you what problems you had in that

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, but it worked out fine in the end. Bourguiba was here for a couple
                    of weeks; basically his problem was one of aging and increasing senility and so
                    on. And then he went home. I think he lived several more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get mixed up in the oil from Libya question or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MEYERS: I didn't. That was something that was so hot that the political cone
                    Libya desk officer took it over. The incumbent, Warren Clark, tried to include
                    me as much as he could. I remember one afternoon going with Warren to
                    Undersecretary U. Alexis Johnson's office. Warren had a decision memo that
                    Johnson needed to clear. And again, it must have been winter, because it was
                    already dark. I stood at the desk. Secretary Johnson had the desk lamp on and
                    his cigarette smoke curled up toward the light. And I just had this visual of
                    this white haired man reading this paper. And I remember just standing there
                    thinking, “You're standing on the edge of history.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A paper you had drafted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: A couple of sentences, at least; a comma there or a crossed “t” there or
                    something, part of it, not that much though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the end of several years there, you were
                        transferred to the other end of Africa, to Johannesburg, where you were
                        economic and commercial officer. Was this something you looked forward to or
                        requested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, I did request it. One of the things that happened during the two
                    years that I was in AF/N was a switch in my career “cone” from political to
                    economic. Back in the early 70s — I don't know what the setup is now — they had
                    what was called a “Junior Threshold.” In order to get promoted from FSO-6 to
                    FSO-5, you had to go through another review. My career counselor was telling me
                    that the political cone was so crowded that it really would be a good idea to
                    switch to the econ cone because chances were I just might not make it to FSO-5.
                    I talked to my bosses and, in particular, Jim Blake about it. And he said “Look,
                    as you can see from AF/N, econ is where a lot of the action is. You can't
                    separate these countries from their economic and trade interests.” So I went
                    ahead and I switched. There were some interesting econ positions open. One that
                    was also a possibility was Tunis, but that didn't work out. And Johannesburg
                    sounded fine, so I was okay with going there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: When I first got there it was Larue Lutkins, Larry Lutkins. Then he and
                    his wife left and John Foley, John and Barbara Foley, came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Well, it was not huge. We had two American consular officers, one quite
                    senior, with several South African staff, several meaning three-four. Then there
                    were two officers in the econ/commercial section. I was the junior of the two
                    Americans and we had a couple of local employees in econ as well. There was a
                    labor officer who was based in Jo'burg. And then there was the Consul General.
                    There was also a USIS office in a separate location with two officers. So it was
                    about the same size as the Sydney Consulate General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the political work was done in Pretoria, I
                        believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: The political work was done in Pretoria and in Cape Town. The political
                    section of the embassy moved there when the South African parliament went into
                    session. And much of the economic work was, too. We had more of a commercial
                    focus in Jo'burg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the apartheid make the work there difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Apartheid did not make the work per se difficult. But apartheid made
                    living and tolerating the situation in South Africa, as a human being,
                    difficult. You always had to swallow hard and look the other way when you saw
                    the inequities the blacks suffered. In terms of work, what made the work
                    difficult were the policies that we adopted to show our disapproval. We decided
                    not to promote tradshows, missions, anything — with South Africa. If an American
                    businessman happened to stumble in and wanted help in marketing, we would, of
                    course, take care of him. But there were no trade shows. Nothing like that. If
                    an American company wanted an agent to sell their goods, we would try to find
                    one. This was a request that came from the Commerce Department. But our posture
                    was passive rather than active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this at the time when American companies were
                        beginning to withdraw their investments in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Not yet. The pressure wasn't on yet. The Sullivan principles hadn't been
                    devised. That was still in the future. But, we had very little to do. We had a
                    lot of time on our hands; my boss, who had just come from South Vietnam where
                    things were always popping, was particularly frustrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any black Americans on the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: While I was there we sent out our first black officer. A man named Jim
                    Baker was assigned to Pretoria as an economic officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he get down to Jo'burg very often?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Once in a while he would come down. We would get together in the office;
                    sometimes we would go out to lunch. If we were going to lunch, we had to go to a
                    five star hotel. And we had to telephone ahead that a black was coming — his
                    name was Jim Baker, that he was a first secretary in the American Embassy in
                    Pretoria and was visiting Johannesburg for the afternoon on business and he
                    would be coming with a fellow officer so there would be two. We'd just say a
                    “fellow officer” and when I, a white female, walked in with him, you should have
                    seen the expressions.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest experiences I had in South Africa, I think in my whole
                    Foreign Service career, was the time Jim and I and a friend were able to visit a
                    gold mine owned by Gold Fields, South Africa. We drove out to the Reef and went
                    all the way down to the bottom of the shafsome 5,000 feet dowto the working
                    level of the mine. African miners, ore, trainlots of activity. We then had lunch
                    at the mine manager's home, all of us. Then we watched the refining of the gold
                    bars. Just the first smelting but the bars produced were some 90 percent plus
                    gold and very heavy. I tried to pick one up but I couldn't get very far! We also
                    saw the housing where the miners lived — blacks coming in from other countries
                    and the black homelands, so called, within South Africa. They were living in
                    squalid, crowded conditions, dormitories, etc. All in all it was quite a
                    memorable day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no officer from Commerce on your staff, was
                        there, did you have to do all the commercial work yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, we did it and we were both from State. Again, we're just talking '72
                    to '74 here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the relations with the Embassy. Were they
                        cordial, workmanlike?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I think they were cordial. Most contact was between the CG (Consul
                    General) and the Embassy. My boss had more contact with the economic counselor
                    than I did. There was not a lot of back and forth. They were doing their work
                    and analysis and we were doing ours.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Not there. I participated in a few events. The officers that really had
                    the challenging and exciting work were the USIS officers, because they were
                    mandated to reach out to the minorities, well, majorities shall we say: the
                    blacks, the Indians, the coloreds, those who were excluded from white, “proper”
                    South African society. I do remember going along to some of their programs and
                    events — out to the sprawling black township, Soweto, one night and getting
                    stopped by the South African police when they saw three white faces in a car, a
                    couple of which were women. “Excuse me, but what are you doing out here?” When
                    we explained, well, it was “okay,” begrudgingly okay. There was a control system
                    — when we were going to go out to a black township, the Consulate or USIS had to
                    notify the local government office in Jo'burg ahead as we were supposed to get
                    “permission” to go. So we played the game of putting in an application saying we
                    were going and we would never go pick up the permission to go. Because we felt
                    we shouldn't have to ask in the first place. That kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Johannesburg, did you have a feeling that
                        the apartheid system was on its way out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I thought it would last a long time. I felt that the police and the
                    system were still very much in control. As it was it lasted another twenty years
                    or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any personal hostility to you as an
                        American there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: At that point, not yet. We had not really started to push and attack the
                    system yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, following your interesting assignment in South
                        Africa, you were selected to take a course in Japanese. Which you'd asked
                        for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MEYERS: I had. During a vacation break, while in South Africa, I took a trip to
                    the Far East over Christmas and New Year's vacation. One of the officers in
                    Johannesburg and his wife had previously served in Hong Kong and Jim told me how
                    quickly the Far East, at least in appearance, was changing, becoming modernized,
                    more westernized. So I decided to go have a look and one of the places I went
                    was Japan. And I was absolutely struck, captured by Japan in two ways. First of
                    all, I had never been in a culture that seemed so different. I'm talking about
                    the arts — kabuki, and music and flower arranging— and dress — the kimonos. And
                    at the same time, here was the city of Tokyo very much a part of the modern
                    world. And all these businessmen racing back and forth, in their black suits and
                    white shirts, no pastels yet. And I thought, “These guys are going to give us a
                    run for our money when it comes to trade and commerce.” And I also thought, “I
                    want to be part of that.” I came back to Johannesburg and on my desk was a
                    circular asking for volunteers for hard language training, beginning in the
                    summer of '74. One of the languages offered was Japanese. Others were Urdu,
                    Chinese, and Farsi. I thought Farsi might be interesting, although I'd never
                    been to Iran. I talked to our new CG, John Foley. And I said, “I want to
                    volunteer for hard language training; I have the aptitude for it. And I'm
                    vacillating between Farsi and Japanese.” I gave him my reasoning, my thoughts on
                    Japan. And he felt Japan was the smarter choice. So I volunteered for Japanese.
                    In light of subsequent events in Iran, I'm certainly glad I did!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that course intended to do? To help you speak the
                        language, or to read it, or even to write it. Or to get you over the 2,2
                        hurdle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: To get you over the 2,2 hurdle. Basically what that meant was speaking at
                    the 2 level, which is a basic speaking capability, and a rather elementary
                    reading ability. I got the 2,2 after the year. Originally, my onward assignment
                    was Fukuoka in Kyushu. But that got changed because somebody was leaving early.
                    So I went to Tokyo, instead, after the one year. I was glad, because I hadn't
                    had the chance to work in an embassy, only consulates. The downside of going to
                    Tokyo language-wise is you're going to be dealing primarily with Japanese
                    bureaucrats — in the Foreign Ministry and the then Ministry of International
                    Trade and Industry (MITI), and, in my case, Transportation. And most of the guys
                    I dealt with had studied English for years. So, I'd go make my calls and of
                    course we would converse in English because they knew what they were talking
                    about and I would have been sitting there with my Japanese dictionary. So I went
                    to Tokyo for three years, actually, from the summer of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you specialized in transportation problems. That
                        includes, I presume, the automobile problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, I had the transportation portfolio. At first I thought, “Ah, the
                    Embassy's motor pool; I'll have control of the motor pool. That's going to be
                    real power!” Of course, really, I dealt with trade issues in the transportation
                    field. Yes, it had to do with the beginning of the automobile trade problems
                    between the U.S. and Japan. Too many of their cars coming here; none of our cars
                    going there, for which there were very good reasons. For one thing, U.S.
                    vehicles were huge. And we made only left hand drive, whereas in Japan, you
                    drive on the left. But, also, very importantly, the major part of my time was
                    devoted to airline negotiations and which carriers got to fly where. The only
                    international carrier for Japan then was Japan Air Lines (JAL). In those days,
                    we had three carriers flying to Japan — Northwest and Pan American and Flying
                    Tigers which was only cargo. All went to Japan and beyond. The Japanese wanted
                    to update our aviation agreement, which dated back to the mid-Fifties. They felt
                    it was very unequal in that Japan wasn't being given enough landing points for
                    JAL here.. So there was a lot of friction on that. And I found the airline
                    portfolio absolutely fascinating. And then also there were maritime issues on
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we still encouraging Japanese auto exports to the
                        States or had we stopped that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Aside from our free trade principles, I don't think you could say that we
                    ever “encouraged” Japanese exports to the States. I mean, the Japanese were
                    very, very adept at studying markets and making products consumers want. The
                    U.S. had been through its first “oil shock” in the early Seventies. I got to
                    Japan in '75. The American consumer by then was interested in buying cars that
                    were fuel efficient and smaller. And the Japanese were making those cars, and
                    they found a tremendous reception here. So the cars were promoting
                    themselves.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, I arrived after that. The scandal was '73-'74. Our ambassador to
                    Japan when I arrived in 1975 was James Hodgson, a former Lockheed official. He
                    was the last Nixon-appointed ambassador. No scandal ever touched him and he
                    remained as ambassador through the Ford Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Japanese growing trade surplus with the
                        U.S. Was that much of a problem to us at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MEYERS: The number itself was not a problem. What caused the problem was the
                    perception that Japanese saw trade as a one-way street. In other words, trade
                    meant they could export but, so far as importing, they were not interested in
                    importing manufactured goods but only raw materials since Japan is a natural
                    resource poor country. When it comes to iron ore or natural gas or oil, they're
                    all ready to bring it in and it was the finished goods they would send out.
                    Pressure against Japan began to build, particularly as the Congress here began
                    to see the impact of Japanese exports on various sectors — automobiles, color
                    televisions, steeand on American jobs. And the perception that the U.S.
                    manufacturer was not able to penetrate the Japanese market, that trade was not a
                    two-way street, caused the problem, rather than the numbers.</p>

                    Secretary. But I was there in the control room, saw his comings and goings from
                    the hotel. He was very gracious and also obviously a politician. He arrived late
                    one night, having flown directly from Brussels. President Carter had dispatched
                    him shortly after the inauguration to reassure major allies there would be no
                    significant shift in U.S. policies. And he came to the hotel. And we were all
                    standing in the doorways of our rooms to greet the vice President as he came
                    down the hall. He must have been tired as all get out. But he stopped and
                    greeted everyone. I said “hello” and that my family was from Minnesota. And the
                    next morning, as he left, I was back on duty. So I went to the doorway to meet
                    him again and he looked at me and said “I met you last night.” And I was
                    impressed that he remembered my face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any other problems we should talk about
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I don't think so. It was an interesting tour. I was actually supposed to
                    be there two years and I extended to three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were brought back to the Japanese desk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Oh, yes. Which I asked for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there you were again doing economic work. How many of
                        you were handling economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: There were two of us. Two out of six officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What problems were you faced with there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: One of the major things that I was working on was energy, a continuing
                    problem. We'd been through a second oil crisis by the late Seventies. We were
                    trying to work with the Japanese to develop and fund research on alternative
                    sources of energy. And there was a sense that the Japanese owed this to us
                    because they were running such huge surpluses in trade. So let's take a bit of
                    that money and plow it back into development of alternative fuels. I coordinated
                    those efforts with our own Energy Department and the Japanese Embassy, of
                    course, working back to Tokyo. I can't think of any specific problems in this
                    area. I guess the major surprise of my tenure was Secretary Vance's resignation
                    over the botched hostage rescue attempt in Iran. I heard it first when a
                    Japanese reporter I knew called, seeking my reaction. And I said “What?” And he
                    said “Yes, I'm over here at the White House and they're handing us Xerox copies
                    of the Secretary's resignation letter. And I said “Well, Imai-san, I know
                    nothing about it and furthermore I have nothing to say about it.” And then hung
                    up the phone and shouted, “Does anybody know that Secretary Vance has
                    resigned?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to get the Japanese to assume more
                        international responsibility? Remember, we said “You're now big boys and you
                        ought to do more?” Or did that come within your portfolio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: We were beginning to push the Japanese to do more in international aid
                    and assistance. By the time I got back to Tokyo years later we were holding
                    formal discussions to better coordinate our aid programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to deal much with criticism of the Japanese
                        from American sources, from the Congress or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, answering occasional letters. Maybe later on, but not for the two
                    years in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after two interesting years on the Japan desk you
                        went to Yokohama. That was for language training, I gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MEYERS: That was for language training. Actually, I had made up my mind as I left
                    Tokyo in 1978 to come back to the Japan desk. The only way I could drag myself
                    onto the plane at Narita was to say “Okay, you're going to go back. You're on
                    the Japan desk; that's great. And you're going to start working on getting back
                    to Yokohama so you can finish the language training. Because, yes, you want to
                    be a Japan hand.” So, fortunately the assignment to Yokohama came through. I
                    didn't want the full course back in '75. I wanted the one year so I could come
                    to the Embassy, work, and see if I really wanted to be in Japan as much as I
                    thought I did. And I found I did want to make it my specialty. So, yes, I got
                    back to Yokohama and had a very good study year there. Because, first of all,
                    the teachers just knocked themselves out, the Japanese language instructors. And
                    the classes were small. I mean, two of you and the instructor sitting there;
                    there was no escape. There was nowhere to run and there was nowhere to hide. So
                    it was pretty intensive but therefore very good. And that's where we really got
                    into the reading, as well as the speaking. Reading selected newspaper articles
                    and listening to radio news and television until you understood what they were
                    talking about. Embassy Tokyo also offered supplemental language courses. But
                    Yokohama was fulltime and I achieved a 3+,3 rating. I could always talk better
                    than I could read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the end of that you were sent to Fukuoka, where
                        you expected to go for your first tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, I was very happy to go. Because I'd worked hard on my Japanese in
                    Yokohama and I knew if I went to Fukuoka, it would stay the same or maybe even
                    improvsince I would use it more — and I wouldn't slip backwards, which is what I
                    feared would happen in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in charge of the Consulate? How large was the
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Well, if you counted everyonAmericans and Japanese — maybe twenty five,
                    thirty. Not many Americanonly four. The Admin was run by a Japanese, the admin
                    section. We had one American heading up the consular, one American heading up
                    econ/commercial and a branch public affairs officer (BPAO) and myself. The
                    Japanese staff totaled about twenty, twenty three or so. And a wonderful, tight
                    knit, cooperative bunch. I mean they were just super.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your problems you faced?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MEYERS: I guess the major issue that came up had to do with our
                    political/military relationship. I had two U.S. military bases within my
                    consular district. One was the Iwakuni Marine air base on the main island of
                    Honshu and the other was the Sasebo naval base over in Nagasaki prefecture. The
                    U.S. carrier Enterprise and its battle group were planning a port call to
                    Sasebo. And it was the first in years because the last time the Enterprise came,
                    we were still in Vietnam and huge anti-Vietnam demonstrations occurred in
                    Sasebo. The sailors came ashore but they were never allowed off the base because
                    it wasn't safe. There were actually a couple of Japanese killed in the
                    demonstrations. So there was a lot of tension. Everyone thought all would
                    probably be fine; Vietnam's long past. We had also developed a much more
                    cooperative military relationship over the years. I went from the Consulate to
                    report on the visit as did the pol/mil officer from Embassy Tokyo. All went
                    quite well. That visit, was one highlight of my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Nagasaki was in your district, as you mentioned,
                        apparently. Any residual feeling there about Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Little. August 9th is still remembered each year. And there were a few
                    hardcore demonstrators, Communists and so on. One other event I recall about
                    Kyushu as being really memorable was a visit by a Congressional delegation
                    (CODEL) from the House Subcommittee on Ways and Means. It was led by Sam Gibbons
                    from Florida, who was a prince of a man. Anyway, his CODEL of Republicans and
                    Democrats, and wives and staffers, outnumbered the Consulate staff almost two to
                    one. And at first I thought “How are we ever going to handle this?” But we did.
                    Almost every member of the subcommittee would go to Tokyo each year for trade
                    discussions to emphasize the importance of trade being a two way street. And
                    each year the CODEL would also make a study tour outside Tokyo. So they came to
                    Kyushu when I was there. We arranged a very busy schedule. They toured a Nissan
                    plant in eastern Kyushu and a semiconductor facility operated by Texas
                    Instruments. We traveled a fair amount through the countryside. I remember one
                    day being on a bus driving from somewhere to somewhere. Two members were talking
                    and looking at the rugged Kyushu hills and remarked, “Good thing we didn't have
                    to come ashore here back in '45. This would have been rough going.” All in all
                    their visit went extremely well. They worked hard but they also had a good
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the end of your tour there, in Fukuoka, you were
                        sent to the National War College. That is always an interesting year. Any
                        reflections of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MEYERS: It was a wonderful year for me because it gave me an opportunity to learn
                    about subjects of which I had little knowledge. I went to school with O-5, O-6
                    military officers as well as Foreign Service and a scattering of folks from
                    other civilian agencies. We went to class with these officers daily and learned
                    about military strategy and planning. And they were exposed to the way diplomats
                    try to approach problems. So I think it was a very worthwhile year. The whole
                    concept behind State's participation is that you are an officer bound for higher
                    positions and will be running your own country team someday. And you should know
                    something about where your military attach�s are coming from. With luck, maybe
                    you will even know one or two of these officers who might have been at the
                    college at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You put exactly the terms I would have put it. I think it
                        is an excellent choice. Then, after that, you were back to Tokyo and this
                        time as economic counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Everything fell into place. I got the timely promotion I needed to get
                    the job in Tokyo. I got across the Senior Threshold and so I went back as
                    economic counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was your section there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Pretty good size. Now of course, by this time— mid '80s — the commercial
                    and economic work had been divided. So I was economic counselor. There was also
                    a commercial counselor who represented the Commerce Department. But my section
                    itself had about five or six officers and several Japanese staff. The economic
                    minister headed the two sections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Ambassador pay much attention to what was going on
                        in the economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Lots. The ambassador was Michael Mansfield. Very interested in our work
                    because trade issues continued to define our relationship with Japan. By this
                    time semiconductor production was a problem. And also supercomputers. The U.S.
                    made excellent supercomputers. How come the Japanese weren't buying any for
                    their agencies? There were services access issues — for example, U.S. law firms
                    who wanted to practice in Japan. So, the economic, trade issues were still
                    driving the relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a role in Vice President Bush's visit there
                        in '84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Well, I guess I didn't, because I don't remember it. I got there in July,
                    just in time for Fourth of July.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he may have been there earlier in that year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Perhaps, because I think I would have remembered. I certainly remember
                    President Reagan coming for the Economic Summit in '86, the G-7 as it was then.
                    So I was there for that and participated in that, writing some of the papers and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were having trade disagreements with Japan by this
                        time, weren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, automobile exports were still a serious issue. The Japanese had come
                    up with what they called VRAs, voluntary restraint agreements, whereby they
                    would set a limit on how many cars they would export to the U.S. each year,
                    trying to pacify our Congress. And they also, wisely, began to manufacture over
                    here. I think Honda was the first, into Ohio, and then Nissan went into
                    Tennessee, then Toyota into Kentucky. So that was going on. But automobile trade
                    friction continued. The Japanese MITI Minister came to call on Ambassador
                    Mansfield at one point to try to extract a “satisfactory” VRA number, but the
                    Ambassador refused to be pinned down. The Minister and his entourage tried for
                    about thirty minutes to get him to name a figure but he simply wouldn't do it. A
                    little aside: I often escorted Japanese business visitors to the Ambassador's
                    office. Ambassador Mansfield was such a down to earth person that he would
                    invariably offer them coffee. “Would you gentlemen like to have coffee?” Oh,
                    yes, yes, they'd like to have coffee. Well, then, he would get up and he would
                    walk into his executive washroom and prepare his finest instant. And I would say
                    “May I help you, Mr. Ambassador?” “No, no, Marilyn, I think I can manage, I can
                    handle it.” And his Japanese guests were dumbfounded. Here is this woman,
                    sitting here, and here is the American Ambassador, in his shirtsleeves, serving
                    them, and me, as well. It kind of blew their minds, and was very good for
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Toshiba got into problems for selling
                        illegal equipment to the Soviet Union which was going to improve the Soviet
                        submarines, make them much more quiet? We were very upset about that
                        here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I don't think I was there for that. I left in '87 and came home the long
                    way via the Trans-Siberian Express! I flew to Beijing and met a Foreign Service
                    colleague who was coming back from Japan on home leave. And we took the train
                    across China and Mongolia to Moscow. It took about a week. We got off in Irkutsk
                    in Siberia and spent a couple of nights there. We got the next train on to
                    Moscow and then trained up to Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, and went out to
                    Helsinki and home from there. So that was quite a trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now you were put into the Economic and Business
                        Bureau, handling GATT affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MEYERS: No, it was not GATT, it was the Office of International Investment
                    Affairs, which deals with policy regarding direct investment. So it was not
                    trade in products. We were very much involved in the Uruguay Round of the GATT
                    negotiations underway then. But we were negotiating for freer investment flows.
                    Governments should institute policies that would neither entice nor restrict
                    direct investment. Leave investment decisions to the markets, to a company's
                    decision and don't try to entice nor exclude it thus creating, ultimately,
                    unnatural trade flows. So that's what we were working on in Geneva through the
                    GATT and also in the OECD in Paris. To allow free flows of direct investment as
                    we wanted free flows of trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which countries were we mainly concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Any who were members of the GATT. It was a multilateral approach to the
                    idea of global free trade and investment, an approach we seem to have moved away
                    from in the last five to ten years. I don't know why we decided to abandon
                    multilateralism. Now we're making separate bilateral agreements. One can explain
                    NAFTA which moves toward a larger market. The EU, too, encompasses a large area
                    originally with trade and now political unity aspirations. But otherwise there
                    seems to be a resurgence of bilateralism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, important countries like China or the Soviet Union
                        were not members of GATT. Apparently they were not heavily involved in
                        investment matters at that time, were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, not in private investment. We're talking about the late '80s. The
                    Soviet Union was still the Soviet Union. And China was just beginning to become
                    a player in international trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work on the free trade agreement with Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No. The other investment tool we worked on in the Office of Investment
                    Affairs was the so-called bilateral investment treaties. We focused on countries
                    who were not members of the OECD or the GATT, particularly in Latin America but
                    also Asia. We might be able to conclude a bilateral investment treaty freeing up
                    investment flows and doing away with restrictions. For example, assume you want
                    to come in and establish a company but the Malaysian government or the
                    Paraguayan government requires that it hold 75 percent equity. That was the type
                    of restriction we would try to negotiate down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any problems that stick out in your mind that you would
                        like to mention?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MEYERS: None in particular. It was an interesting two years. Negotiating on a
                    multilateral basis was a new experience for me. On a daily basis it was not as
                    intense as U.S.-Japan head-to-head negotiations. But thinking multilaterally was
                    a challenge. You had to try to factor in something for everyone in making a
                    proposal. I was the office director, we had an extremely competent and hard
                    charging boss, Bill Milam. Most of his office directors were expected to stay
                    three years. That was what he wanted you to do and that was my original plan.
                    And then, after only two years, I got an offer to move back to EAP as a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary and I thought “He isn't going to like this.” And I went to
                    see him with a great deal of trepidation and he was just delighted for me. He
                    was thrilled that I had this opportunity, that this was another step up, that
                    I'd been recognized. And I just sort of sat there and relaxed and said “This is
                    great!” He said “Yeah, this is great.” He thought of me not himself. I would
                    hope that I would do the same for my people, rejoice at their step up rather
                    than bemoan my loss. He was just wonderful, understanding and magnanimous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant secretary in EAP at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Richard Solomon. This was early Bush administration, Bush I, Bush 41;
                    this was September '89. Well, I was called to come and fill the “woman DAS”
                    slot. EAP had four DASes and wanted one of them to be a woman. The woman who had
                    been there had left. The bureau looked around and said “Who else might be good,
                    capable and female?” And my name came up, so I said “Great, I'll take it!” There
                    was a sense that there should be female representation in the front office and I
                    was certainly agreeable to filling that need.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which countries did you supervise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: The Bureau was divided amongst three “geographic” DASes and one so-called
                    “economic DAS.” I was one of the geographic DASes and was responsible for
                    Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific island states, such as the Cook Islands,
                    Papua New Guinea, and Fiji. I also oversaw relations with the TTPI, the Trust
                    Territory of the Pacific, which had evolved into two independent states, the
                    Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia although they were still
                    under a Compact of Association with the U.S. Palau was the only remaining part
                    of the TTPI. The Northern Marianas (Saipan) had voted to become a commonwealth
                    of the United States, rather than independent, so technically we did not deal
                    with them because they were not a foreign country. So there was quite an
                    assortment of relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A huge amount of territory out there. Did you visit the
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MEYERS: I flew out within a couple of months of taking the job. I was fortunate
                    in that Secretary Baker and then-Defense Secretary Cheney went out to Australia
                    for the annual ministerial bilaterals, called the AUSMins, the Australian/U.S.
                    ministerials, covering defense and foreign policy. I went as part of that
                    delegation. And then I stayed on afterwards and visited almost all the countries
                    in my territory, an orientation tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to go around making speeches on behalf of
                        your countries or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: You mean in Washington?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, or around the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, just a couple of times. I remember one instance when Assistant
                    Secretary Dick Solomon was supposed to make a speech in San Francisco and found
                    that he was double-booked, something that can happen. So I went and subbed for
                    him. I think the general theme was something about prospects for Asia. I was
                    part of a three-person panel which included a Japanese who worked for McKenzie
                    and Company in Japan. He was published and extremely well known. He was also a
                    dynamic speaker, fluent in English. He spoke first but I knew I would be okay
                    because the second speaker was a bankeI don't remember his nationality. His
                    presentation was a series of charts and graphs you couldn't possible see unless
                    you were sitting in the front row. The audience practically fell asleep. And I
                    thought “I'm saved; whatever I say after him, it's going to be interesting, it's
                    going to be fascinating, I'm going to have 'em.” It just worked out perfectly.
                    You have to learn that people don't like charts, especially if they can't see
                    them. But for the most part, no, I didn't speak much publicly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1991, you went to Australia as DCM. Who was the
                        ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: A gentleman named Mel Sembler, who was a Presidential appointee as
                    Ambassador to Australia and Nauru, the island state just north of Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a large embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes. Not as big as Tokyo but it was a large embassy, with several
                    agencies represented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and you had a number of consulates, too, didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, four. We had Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, the largest, and then
                    Brisbane, which was still open then but has since been closed. We also had a
                    consular agent in Adelaide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get around to the consulates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes, an orientation trip within a couple of months of getting there.
                    After that I traveled sometimes for a specific event or to represent the
                    ambassador. And then, when I was charg� for about seven or eight months, I got
                    around quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What problems did you have as DCM there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Basically the relationship is very sound and goes back for years. We had
                    fought together in World War II and in Vietnam. The Aussies were also right
                    there during the Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm. Our greatest friction was in
                    the economic trade area. We were heavily subsidizing our agricultural exports,
                    particularly then, to try to force the Europeans, who were subsidizing even more
                    than we were, to come to the negotiating table. Our euphemism for this was the
                    Export Enhancement Program (EEP). And the Australians were very unhappy about
                    this because we were selling below their cost into their export markets. They
                    didn't have sufficient budget to subsidize their wheat farmers. So we were
                    knocking them out of markets where, had there been no subsidies, they could have
                    done quite well. And they were upset about this and understandably so. The
                    agricultural and economic counselors dealt with this problem frequently but the
                    Aussies also raised it with the ambassador. The best we could do to assuage them
                    was to try to tell them a bit ahead of time if a big EEP sale was about to take
                    place. But we couldn't tell them too far ahead lest the information affect the
                    actual grain trading on the Chicago market. I remember in particular receiving
                    cabled instructions once to go tell the Prime Minister at such and such time in
                    Washington — not a minute sooner — that we were about to announce a large wheat
                    sale. It turned out to be 10:30 p.m. in Canberra! So, yes, I did go to the PM's
                    office as instructed but I didn't see Paul Keating. I saw two of his aides who
                    said he would not be pleased at the news. So EEP was our major headache.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were our relations with the Australian Labour
                        government in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MEYERS: They were quite good. Prime Minister Bob Hawke had brought the Australian
                    government a lot closer to us on defense issues. As I mentioned before, Hawke
                    had sent a couple naval ships to join us in the Gulf War and he became a very
                    good friend of President Bush. So the big event that took place while I was
                    there was the state visit of President George H, W. Bush, the first since Lyndon
                    Johnson had come in 1967. The Australians were delighted that President Bush
                    came. The government wasn't so happy with the timing, because it fell right over
                    New Year's and fouled up everyone's holiday plans. And, of course, everyone in
                    the Embassy also had their holiday leave cancelled and I, as the DCM, got to
                    tell them!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President get into these agricultural problems or
                        was it mainly a good will visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: It was primarily a good will visit to underline the soundness of the
                    overall relationship, despite our EEP difficulties. And the President did have
                    the courage to mention the EEP program and to say that we would try to take
                    Australia's sensitivities into account. But he didn't say we would back off it
                    because, of course, we wouldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have any military problems then, with our bases
                        or anything else, while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No. As you know we do not have any troops stationed in Australia, and our
                    intelligence cooperation went smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like an interesting tour. Any speechmaking
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Yes. All DCMs get involved in public diplomacy, and sometimes I would
                    represent the Ambassador if he couldn't go. Then, of course, I was also charg�
                    for eight months. One of the most memorable events I attended was in a small
                    town called Albany in Western Australia. It was around our Memorial Day. During
                    the Second World War a lot of U.S. submarines were based there. The town holds a
                    beautiful commemorative service each year called “Still on Patrol.” Some subs,
                    of course, never came back. They have a bell there that was taken off a sub. And
                    everyone stands at attention as the ambassador or charg� or whoever's
                    representing the embassy reads the list of the submarines that are “still on
                    patrol.” And then they toll the bell once for each sub. And it is so moving.
                    Ambassador Sembler had left by May 1993 so I, as charg�, went to Albany and
                    participated in the service. I still get misty just thinking about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, any final thoughts on your tour in Australia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MEYERS: It was wonderful. Not only was I working with a country and people whom I
                    greatly admired and have a great deal of affection for, many of whom became good
                    friends, but I had the opportunity to work under two different ambassadors, one
                    a political appointee, the other career. Both of them brought different
                    strengths to their job. Political ambassadors are often trashed for general
                    incompetence and insensitivity, but that certainly was not my experience. Mel
                    Sembler had a genuine interest in the relationship and he certainly had a
                    wonderful appreciation of what his professional staff could do for him. He never
                    felt threatened by us. He put his business acumen and people skills to good use;
                    we complimented each other nicely. Then I had a chance to be charg� and run the
                    Embassy and that was a growing experience too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then we go on to the next chapter. In 1994, you went
                        into Burmese language training. Was that something you had asked for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No. I had sought the assignment to Rangoon but the training took place
                    happened because I had a rather long gap — about three months — between my
                    departure from Canberra and my departure from Washington. I had had breast
                    cancer and I had to make sure I had the medical clearance to go out to Burma. So
                    during this time I had abbreviated Burmese language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. I was going to ask you how long it lasted, but
                        several months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Not more than two or three. We covered some of the pleasantries and
                    elementary conversation , no reading.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Rangoon as charg�. When had the
                        Ambassador left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: The last ambassador, Burt Levin, left in the summer of 1990. It was now
                    '94. Due to the bloody put down of the democracy demonstrations by the junta in
                    1988, followed by rampant human rights abuses and their failure to allow the
                    subsequently elected Parliament to take office, we did not assign another. The
                    DCM served as charg� from 1990 to 1994 and that same pattern continued with
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was your staff there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MEYERS: The American staff was quite small; the Burmese staff was quite large.
                    There had been a tremendous down-sizing of our programs after the debacle of
                    198all our aid programs were gone. We continued to employ a number of Burmese to
                    show support for them and also because their other employment prospects were
                    pretty dim. The economy, as mismanaged by the generals, was pretty much in
                    chaos. So, I'd say, American officers totaled, counting our military attach�s,
                    USIS, oh probably about 12. The Burmese, maybe 40-50. That would count all the
                    security guards at the residence, and the other two housing compounds. And then
                    we had our own wonderful Marine guards at the Embassy — about six of them — so
                    eighteen Americans in all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have consular agencies anywhere in Burma or was
                        Rangoon the only post where the flag was flown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Rangoon was the only post that we had. We had had a consulate in Mandalay
                    but it had been closed a few years before. We still had the property there; a
                    lovely old Tudor style house, combined residence and office. So we still owned
                    the property in Mandalay but the consulate had been closed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations like with the government, I
                        gather with the military officers who ran the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I would say distant, icy. And no access.</p>
                <p>Q; Did they ever call you in?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MEYERS: The leaders, of course, are generals who have been running Burma since
                    1962. The only time I got to meet one of them, formally, on my own, General Khin
                    Nyunt, was to present my credentials. The only other time we ever got to meet
                    with the generalusually Khin Nyunt who was head of military intelligence — was
                    when we had an important visitor. For example, we had three or four CODELall
                    Senators — that came out while I was there and they met with him. Khin Nyunt was
                    sort of the junta's, to use a Japanese term, gaijin handler — he was the one who
                    met with outsiders of sufficient rank. He understood some English but always
                    used an interpreter. He met with Madeleine Albright when she came to Burma. She
                    was then Ambassador to the United Nations and had just been to China for the
                    Women's Conference held in Beijing in the summer of '95. She very much wanted to
                    come to Burma to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader who had
                    recently been freed from house arrest. Our main window of access, of course, was
                    the Foreign Ministry. Even there it was difficult to see anyone of upper rank.
                    They were not available, they were too busy, they were whatever, whatever. And
                    it wasn't simply that I was a charg� and did not have a full ambassadorial
                    title. Most of the other Western ambassadors had the same problem. It was easier
                    for the Chinese ambassador, for example, to see somebody in the Foreign Ministry
                    — and the generals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able yourself to meet with Suu Kyi when she was
                        under house arrest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No, when she was under house arrest she was not available to foreigners.
                    One exception was made before I got there. About February of '94
                    then-Congressman Bill Richardson from New Mexico came and he was allowed to meet
                    with her, along with a reporter from the New York Times, and one of the officers
                    from the embassy. But that was the only time. As a rule she was not available to
                    foreigners, nor the Burmese public, when she was under house arrest. When she
                    was released in July '95, it was another matter. Everybody flocked to her
                    compound except me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Because, obviously, military intelligence was sitting there right by her
                    gate, watching everybody who went in and out. The French ambassador, the West
                    German ambassador; I think the British were between ambassadors, so it was the
                    British charg�. They, the junta, say that she's a puppet of the West, the
                    colonial powers, and particularly the U.S. So why do I need to confirm that by
                    charging right in? So some of my lower-ranking officers went to her house
                    because we obviously wanted to know what was going on. I thought it best that I
                    not be in the newspapers, on the TV news, seen sitting cheek by jowl. So I
                    didn't go, although, of course, I was dying to be there. But I sent a note
                    saying, “I would like to meet with you when you feel the time is okay.” Word got
                    back to me a few days later and I went, with my political officer, to meet her
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, she seems to be a remarkable woman. Did we carry on
                        normal business in the sense of visas, things like this? Was there much
                        demand for visas from Burmese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Well, the answer is there wasn't much demand for visas, because the
                    government is very tight in issuing passports and most Burmese are too poor to
                    travel anyway. The junta would issue passports to a few businessmen to travel
                    overseas. And we certainly did not welcome or invite any of their higher level
                    people to the United States. And we had a general policy that no high level
                    Administration people should go out there either. So I pretty much became the
                    funnel through which any contact went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about such things as Leader Grants, and
                        Fulbrights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: This is one of the areas where you would just sit back and say “Oh, if
                    only...” Because you could see there were so many areas where such grants or
                    exchange programs would be of tremendous benefit to the Burmese. Sending
                    professors to teach in Rangoon University, for example, whose medical school,
                    years ago, was cross accredited with the University of London. Or sending a
                    Burmese agronomist to the U.S. to study how to increase crop yields. What we
                    would find when we tried to do leader grants was that the government would issue
                    a passport to one of their own lackeysome eminently unqualified person. Their
                    choice and not ours. And this was not acceptable to us. So that was the real
                    tragedy, because you could just see what was lacking and how many of our
                    programs could help and it just wasn't possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about commerce? Did we import much textiles or other
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Very little trade. There were some U.S. companies that were manufacturing
                    garments in Burma. I think those operations, due to human rights and shareholder
                    pressure, have pretty much shut down. Some U.S. oil companies were doing
                    exploration for natural gas offshore; they've pretty much left. So anything that
                    was going on in terms of investment was pretty much gone. And very little trade,
                    which was one reason why human rights is a major issue in the relationship with
                    Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any opportunity for you to do any speaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MEYERS: My little farewell address at the dinner that the Vice Foreign Minister
                    gave for me two nights before I left. I'm trying to think of a single instance
                    where I was invited to come and speak publicly and I think the answer is no. We
                    traveled as much as we could to find out what is going on in other parts of the
                    country, especially because we couldn't get any information out of anybody in
                    Rangoon. Of course, diplomats were required to obtain advance permission to
                    travel more than 25 miles out of Rangoon. You had to file a note with the
                    Foreign Ministry to request permission and, of course, they forwarded it to
                    military intelligence, MI, who gave thumbs up or down. And usually, if you're
                    trying to leave on a flight on Thursday, by Wednesday at 5:00 p.m., you hadn't
                    had an answer. So you went to the airport Thursday morning and hoped it all
                    worked out. And usually it did but it was always this sort of last minute thing.
                    So I did travel around the country quite a bit but no public speechmaking. The
                    generals did not want the people to think the U.S. had any presence or interest
                    in Burma. But, informally, people were usually glad to see us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I wanted to ask you. Were the people
                        themselves, the man on the street, were they friendly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Oh, yes, very, and very appreciative of any foreigners who did come to
                    Burma. They were glad to see foreign visitors. Some of the Burmese had set up
                    quite successful small travel agencies to work out domestic travel for foreign
                    visitors. A foreigner coming in for travel, having obtained a visa, could go
                    right up to Mandalay whereas we diplomats had to get permission to go there. The
                    Burmese themselves were very receptive to foreign guests though they had to
                    maintain a distance as the junta was watching them closely.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I remember one of the rare groups that came which I was delighted to host at the
                    residence. The American Museum of Natural History in New York was observing its
                    125th anniversary and had organized a trip for its patrons to fly around the
                    world in a chartered aircraft to several countrie“back of beyond” sort of
                    countriewhere, at some time in that 125 years, the museum had carried out some
                    sort of project. The itinerary included places like Madagascar and Papua New
                    Guinea, and Burma and I hosted a reception for them. I invited Burmese guests
                    too. We found that private sector people such as business people and a few
                    Burmese lawyers would come. Invitees from the ministries — in this case the one
                    dealing with cultural affairs — and the Foreign Ministry would not come.
                    Military Intelligence always came because they wanted to keep watch on everybody
                    else. So we could count on their being there. And then my embassy staff, my
                    American officers, political and econ and so on. And it was an exciting evening
                    because the American guests were all movers and shakers and were very interested
                    in what was going on politically and economically. One of the travelers was the
                    publisher of Washingtonian Magazine and when he got back he wrote a fantastic
                    op-ed piece for the Washington Post recognizing the hard work that diplomats do
                    in these off-the-beaten track countries. And he cited a couple of other people,
                    and me, by name and how hard we were working for democracy. “After all the CNN
                    cameras have picked up and gone home,” he wrote, “these diplomats will still be
                    pursuing their task.” And of course telephone service in and out of Burma was
                    nonexistent. Not nonexistent, but dysfunctional because the system they have is
                    basically the one left by the British when they pulled out in '48. And one
                    morning out of the blue, I got a call at home from a friend in Washington. And
                    she said “I'm calling because there's this op-ed piece in The Washington Post
                    this morning and you're mentioned.” And I said “Oh, God, what did I do?” As a
                    diplomat, your first reaction is “No, not in the papers, by name! What did I
                    do?” She said “No, no, no, this is wonderful!” So then she read it to me and
                    mailed me several copies which I still have here someplace.</p>
                <p>So it's a fascinating journey back in time to go to Burma. Thailand has boomed
                    economically and so has Singapore and now Vietnam in the last ten years. And
                    here, left in the dust, is this country that was a fractious democracy on the
                    road to development in the Fifties. Then the military took over in '62 and it
                    has been run by the military ever since. The generals tried the Burmese road to
                    socialism, which was an absolute failure. The currency is worth absolute zilch.
                    It's just shocking the way people live. I think they're poorer now. I left in
                    October '96. I had a chance to go back a couple of years ago in February 2003. I
                    went to Vietnam with an organized tour and thought “As long as I'm this close.”
                    And fortunately one of my Australian friends was the Australian ambassador in
                    Rangoon at the time. So I went and stayed with Trevor and Christine, his wife,
                    and spent a week there. The country's gone backwards. The only thing that's
                    changed is more cars and trucks crowding the roads in Rangoon. Once you get out
                    in the countryside, you still see the oxcarts and broken down buses.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Do we have a U.S. carrier? No. You can fly a U.S. carrier to Bangkok.
                    Then it's about an hour's flight on Thai Airways or Burma Air, north to Rangoon.
                    But I noticed that air service in and out of Rangoon had been severely cut back
                    since 1996 when I was there. There were far fewer flights both in and out than
                    before.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Unfortunately my crystal ball is dark. I see little glimmer of hope in
                    the short term. How long can these guys hang on? The first generation hung in
                    there from '62 until the late 80's. Until '87, '88 when Ne Win formally stepped
                    down after his disastrous Burmese road to socialism policies left the economy in
                    ruins. And then the next group replaced him. And now Khin Nyunt, head of
                    military intelligence, the one designated to meet with foreigners, has been
                    removed by the junta. Too forward leaning, too inclined, perhaps, to try to have
                    some sort of dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi. So he is under house arrest now and
                    has been replaced by a hardliner who roughed up her and her entourage in May,
                    2003. Some of her people were killed and she was injured. And now she's again
                    under house arrest and really isolated, all her political supporters having been
                    kicked off her compound. She's stuck there all by herself. I hope she has her
                    cook, at least, so she can get some meals, she's so slim, too slim. Changing the
                    system there is not really important enough to any outsider and the Burmese
                    people themselves have been ground into the dust. The Chinese have certainly
                    moved into there in a big way commercially.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They have no interest in changing the government,
                        presumably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: No. So long as they can get what they wantrade, construction contracts,
                    increasing influence. I think the Japanese have been eager to go back in with
                    aid projects. But they've held the line and not done it. I think it's very, very
                    tough. I don't know, frankly, how much longer Aung San Suu Kyi can hang on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do the Indians play a role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I'd say, politically, not really, and economically, yes. They held quite
                    an impressive trade show while I was there, and that was seven years ago. So
                    they were developing commerce and trade. I think the generals are happier to
                    deal with them than any of the Western powers. But it would be the Chinese who
                    would be number one.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>What was interesting overall was the different approach we and the Europeans took
                    to demonstrate our disapproval of the regime. The U.S. pulled out its ambassador
                    and left a DCM to function as charg�. The Europeans — Germany, France, the UK,
                    the Italians — kept their ambassadors but withdrew their military attach�s. We
                    kept our military attach�s. I, for one, thought that was a good way to handle
                    it. We registered our disapproval but we kept our two men in military uniform to
                    liaise with this military government, at least at a lower level. I don't want to
                    push this too far but military have common experience and language and I always
                    felt we had better contacts at the lover level because of our attach�s. And I
                    really don't think the European heads of mission had any better access higher up
                    simply because of their ambassadorial titles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marilyn, you don't paint a very optimistic picture of
                        conditions in Burma and the future. But I gather that's the way it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I think that's the way it is, not much hope in the near future. Actually,
                    I have a video given me by one of the officers who was serving in our Embassy
                    during the democracy demonstrations in 1988. You see these hordes of Burmese
                    parading in the street in front of the Embassy and, when I first heard the
                    audio, I couldn't figure out what they were saying. You're hearing this
                    “democracy, democracy, democracy.” They were chanting “democracy,” with the
                    emphasis on the first syllable. That was a time of hope and the government
                    squashed it brutally. About three thousand people were killed by the military.
                    Young students made it to the steps of Rangoon Hospital and, as the doctors and
                    nurses came out to help them, the soldiers began shooting the doctors and
                    nurses. Just awful! Now, this was 15 years ag1988 — but there's been harsh
                    repression ever since. And even though the National League for Democracy won the
                    election in 1990 by a landslide, by 85 per cent, the generals have never ceded
                    power. So, I'm sorry, Tom, I would love to be able to say, a week from Tuesday
                    or two months from now things will change but I just don't see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other comments on your time there in Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: Simply that I'm so gratified I had the chance to serve there. I went
                    basically because I wanted to run my own embassy and knew that the DCM was
                    charg�. But the experience of seeing that multi-faceted country, and of
                    listening to Suu Kyi the year she was free and would make speeches of hope and
                    encouragement to the throngs who gathered at her gate each weekenthese things
                    will stay with me for the rest of my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that tour, you came back in '96 and retired. Are
                        there any final thoughts you have about a career in the Foreign Service?
                        Would you recommend it to young people these days, men and women?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MEYERS: Well, for me it was the perfect career. Looking back, I have no regrets
                    over other roads not taken. As for others ... I think the Department has changed
                    somewhat and no longer has the commitment to a lifetime, professional corps. On
                    the plus side, women now have a level playing field in getting ahead. And, of
                    course, a lot more fields have opened to professional women too — law, banking,
                    medicine. But, if you're interested in international affairs and in spending
                    time actually living abroad, as well as here in Washington, the Foreign Service
                    still warrants serious consideration. Just keep in mind that you might end up
                    living overseas — but not necessarily where you wanted to go!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you very much. This is Thomas Dunnigan
                        speaking on January 17, 2005. I've been talking with Marilyn Meyers about
                        her career in the Foreign Service on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training. Thank you very much, Marilyn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MEYERS: I enjoyed it, thank you!</p>
