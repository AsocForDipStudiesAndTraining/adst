                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the March 15, 2000, the Ides of March. This is an
                        interview with Sarah Horsey-Barr. This is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. Sarah, let's start at the beginning. When and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's definitely the beginning. June 8, 1948, here in Bethesda,
                    Maryland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: My immediate family is a Foreign Service family. In fact, six weeks
                    after I was born I went off to my first post as a dependent in Rome, and I've
                    been overseas for lo these fifty years. My father, Outerbridge Horsey II, who is
                    deceased now, had been in the Foreign Service for some 30 or 35 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a major name, great name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, he was one of those names that people always talk about when
                    they're talking about the Foreign Service, one of those unusual names that
                    characterize....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name was mentioned just, I think, last week with
                        somebody. It comes up again and again, particularly on the Personnel
                        side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's interesting, because I didn't know if he had worked in
                    Administration or Personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was doing something getting people assigned.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, he had a very interesting career. In those days, if you
                    remember, people often went to the same country on successive occasions - this
                    was before Kissinger's GLOP policy - and his place was Italy. His first post was
                    Naples back in 1944 - no, it would have been earlier than that actually, because
                    the second post, I think, he was in Budapest and he was evacuated from there
                    during the war. So it would have been very early, late '30s, very early '40s.
                    But anyway he had four assignments in Italy, each of which was for four years,
                    so he became quite an Italian expert, if you will, and personally loved the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He and Homer Byington...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, they were good friends - Homer Byington III, the IV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Third. There were three that were consuls
                        general in Naples, a grandfather, a son and a grandson, and he was the
                        grandson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I remember visiting them, but I never kept all their enumerations
                    straight in my mind. He spent a lot of time in Italy. He spent a lot of time
                    focused on Europe, and, of course, the United States being such a Eurocentric
                    country even today and certainly at that point just before and during and after
                    the war, that was, I guess, in the view of many the place to be if you were
                    interested in foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: He was one of seven children - seven to five; I'd have count them -
                    of a Maryland family. His father was a lawyer who moved to New York because
                    there was no money to be had, no income, if you will, around
                    Washington/Baltimore back in those days in the late 19th century. So he moved to
                    New York, his father, so he grew up there. His father died when he was very
                    young. Our family is a Catholic family, and my grandparents' view, as I heard
                    it, was that if you wanted to give a good Catholic education in those days -
                    we're talking turn of the century to 1910; my father was born in 1910 - you had
                    to send your children overseas to a good Catholic school. So the family, which
                    wasn't rich - they were living on my grandfather's earnings as a lawyer in New
                    York - the kids all went to Catholic schools in England. My father first left
                    home when he was eight years old. I remember seeing his passport application. I
                    started out in the Passport Office, and I saw his passport application, a little
                    tyke of eight years old, and there he was going off to boarding school in
                    England. All his brothers and sisters did the same in various schools. Most of
                    them were not in the same school, but they were all either Catholic nuns or
                    priests or whatever. Then the parents, and my grandmother after my grandfather
                    died, would go over for vacations there. They'd take a house in the south of
                    France or the south of England. You know, the English vacations are very
                    different from ours; they have a month at Christmas and a month at Easter and
                    then just two months in the summer, so it's more sort of balanced than American
                    school vacations. So that was the only time that the kids, after they were about
                    seven, eight, nine years old, spent time with their family, with their siblings
                    and their parents, during these vacations, as I said, either in the south of
                    France or the south of England. I guess it is a pretty odd sort of upbringing
                    for a child. After he did that, he went to - let me see; was it Oxford or
                    Cambridge? I think, Cambridge - so he studied at Cambridge and did the
                    equivalent of an undergraduate there and then came back to this country and went
                    to MIT and studied to be an engineer and in fact graduated and started
                    working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect he went to Cambridge because Cambridge was more
                        scientifically inclined than Oxford.HORSEY-BARR: You may well be right. I've
                        never been to either in my travels and so it's just never been fixed, but
                        you may well be right. Anyway, then he came back here and he did study to be
                        an engineer at MIT and graduated and then actually started working in New
                        York as an engineer but was very bored and decided that he would try and
                        join the Foreign Service. So at that point I gather that he was kind of in a
                        quandary because he hadn't spent much time in this country. I remember him
                        telling me he decided that he would take a year and go traveling around this
                        country picking up odd jobs and whatever to get to know the country because
                        he was sure when he came before the board of examiners that this would be a
                        natural question: “You're a foreigner. Why do you want to be in the U.S.
                        Foreign Service?” So he did that. Anyway, he was ultimately successful in
                        passing the exam and loved it. Never did I hear any regret, and he was
                        rather successful, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did he meet your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's an interesting story too. They're actually distant relatives.
                    The Horsey and Lee families historically, at least the Maryland branches of
                    both, are related through both the Lees and the Carrolls of Maryland and such,
                    so he and my mother were fourth cousins. They probably met as children, but
                    their first real getting to know each other, as I hear the story, was when he
                    was sent back from, I think, the second assignment in Budapest with TB. He got
                    TB there, so he was sent back and the Department medical people, I guess, said,
                    “Take a year and recover from your TB.” So he went off to the country, and they
                    were adjoining farms out near Frederick, Maryland, and so she was sent over to
                    entertain her distant cousin and one thing led to another. That was probably in
                    the '40s, early '40s sometime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had your mother gone to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, she grew up in the country there near Frederick, didn't go to
                    school, was tutored at home. They used to spend half the year in Frederick in
                    the summer. My grandfather on that side had been actually a Foreign Service type
                    himself. He had been a political appointee and was head of legation in Honduras
                    and in Guatemala and then down in Peru but as a political, but this was much
                    earlier in his life. At this point he was sort of the manager of this property,
                    this family property there near Frederick. Then in the winters, for some reason
                    that's still not clear to me, they would go to Atlantic City. She never went to
                    school until she went to college, and then she went to college up in Westchester
                    County in New York, Manhattanville College, a nice, good Catholic college. I
                    think her degree was in library science, and then she worked in Baltimore - she
                    had grown up in Baltimore, the latter years anyway - I think for the diocese,
                    the Catholic diocese. Then she worked for the OSS during the war down at the
                    Navy complex, offices with apartments, down in those offices. She has some
                    interesting stories about Wild Bill Donovan. Then she didn't work as so many
                    women, so many Foreign Service women in those days, after she got married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bethesda, you were born in '48, and then you
                        went rather quickly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Six weeks later we went to Rome, where my father was political
                    counselor. My first language ended up, because of that, being Italian. We stayed
                    there that time four years and then came back to Washington. We lived out on the
                    Apientita, if you know Rome. Nobody in their right mind would live out there
                    now; traffic has just gotten so awful. But that was the first of I'd say a total
                    of about 15 or 16 years that I lived in Italy between one place and another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have been four years old when you came back.
                        Then you were in Washington for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Maybe three or four years.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're moving into the years where you're getting
                        educated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes. I went to school here. We lived up off Massachusetts Avenue
                    near the Cathedral. Went to a nice little convent school there. When we left
                    Washington, we went to Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be around...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: This is always difficult figuring out the dates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1956 or '57.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, about '56, because then about '60 or '59 - I think it's '59 -
                    we went to Rome again. So we spent, say, three years, I guess, in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like in Tokyo for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That was our first exposure to the Sacred Heart nuns, which we then
                    sort of stuck with all through our education, it seemed, all of us. They made
                    for a very pleasant academic environment and such, and they had an international
                    school there, which, as I remember, was very pleasant, maybe half Japanese and
                    half whatever of different nationalities, but the classes were all in English.
                    We had a very nice house, which is still the DCM's house in Rome. The house was
                    on a bit of a hill. I haven't been back to Japan, so I don't know what it's like
                    now, but it seems in reflection that Tokyo was made up of small villages and the
                    small villages made up the larger city. Maybe they were just neighborhoods. We
                    would go down with the maids to the various village festivities, which were
                    Japanese, Buddhist. Who knows what they were in retrospect, but they were always
                    a lot of fun. We were very well accepted by the Japanese that were attending
                    these festivities. I remember Tokyo as being very crowded. I remember a number
                    of trips that we took. My father was a golfer, and so we would go on these short
                    vacations to different places around Japan, all of which had golf courses and
                    were very pleasant. Like so many places, I hate to go back for fear of ruining
                    the memory.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I'm sure it's gotten very congested. I'm sure it's pleasant for
                    people who go there now, but for somebody that brings the whole baggage of
                    childhood memories and all that....</p>
                <p>The ambassador, I remember, was Douglas MacArthur and Wahwee.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, no, I can't remember any, but my mother's got a lot of those,
                    I'm sure. A lot of people have, as well as Douglas MacArthur stories. I'm not
                    sure that he was, from what I gather, terribly beloved as a person, though he
                    may have been very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People say he could be very effective but he was not a
                        warm person. [Inaudible.]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Did you? He's deceased now, isn't he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I think Wahwee...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She died before he did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, that's right, because I remember seeing him at a cocktail party
                    and she had died. Well, they were nice to me, is all I can say. I don't think
                    they did this with all children, but he/they gave me this collection of glass
                    animals. I don't know how long our period of overlap was, so I don't know what
                    the occasions were on which I was presented with these various animals, but I
                    ended up with a whole lot of them and they all came from the MacArthurs. My
                    brothers and sisters did not get these, and I cannot remember why it was that
                    somehow I struck favor with one or the other or both. I was pretty young in
                    Japan, so it's hard to remember very much about that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there, you say, four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Four years. Well, I was there six years actually, but my father was
                    there four years, because from there he went on to Prague as ambassador and
                    there were no schools.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: He was DCM in Rome, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was schooling like in Rome? Back to the sisters
                        again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, the same Sacred Heart sisters, who probably still are an
                    international order, French based, but have schools all over the place. Yes,
                    they had a number of schools. They had two in Rome, one of which was for poorer,
                    less advantaged children over near the Vatican, and the one we went to was
                    attached to that church, the Trinita dei Monti that you see at the top of the
                    Spanish steppes. That's their church, and the school was attached there. As I
                    said, they were French nuns, so you spoke French outside the classroom and
                    Italian in the classroom, because it was run according to Italian state
                    curriculum. It was very traditional, some might say monastic. In reflection at
                    the time I didn't mind it, but thinking back on it, it does seem rather monastic
                    and barbaric.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One hears so many stories of the nuns, you know, with
                        rulers and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: They didn't deal with the rulers, but they had funny ideas on
                    things. All your mail was screened, incoming and outgoing, except, I think, to
                    parents. If you were a boarder, as I was the last two years, you weren't allowed
                    to leave unless your parents had given permission and specified whom you could
                    leave with. We were lucky. My younger sister was with me the first year that I
                    was a boarder, and I think we were going to the dentist to get braces or
                    whatever, so my father had arranged things, which I'm sure you couldn't do
                    today, having an embassy car pick us up on Wednesday afternoons, because there
                    were no classes, to take us to the dentist. So we got out once a week, but
                    otherwise you never left the place. You were there morning to night. You woke up
                    at 5:30.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So much for boys.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: On, no boys. Boys were out of the question. I do remember being
                    called on the carpet because some boy in Prague was writing to me, another
                    embassy kid, and, oh gosh, this was worse than death. But it was pleasant. It
                    was a supportive atmosphere at the time. I could not go back to it obviously. If
                    I had kids, I'm not sure I'd put my own kids in that situation. But they were
                    nice nuns. The kids were all Italian except for my younger sister and me. We
                    were the only foreigners there. We went in the first year not speaking any
                    Italian, because we'd lost it all, and that was difficult. But the Italians are
                    a very nice people, and it was a very pleasant atmosphere. It was a very
                    different academic upbringing than what we get here in the States, not so great
                    in sciences or math, but great on the linguistics and history and that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they train you sort of in - I may be a little off on
                        this - the Cartesian method of thesis, antithesis and synthesis, this very
                        logical approach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, that was part of it. As an example of that, you had to get up
                    in front of the class and kind of be drilled by the teacher on whatever the
                    lesson was, and then all the students would take their time drilling you as
                    well. They were not paid but they had different roles that they were supposed to
                    play in terms of this thesis that you mentioned. So you really had to learn how
                    to think and look at things from a different perspective. They were very heavy
                    on the classics, which I think is essential for a founding in education. I don't
                    know that kids take much in the way of Latin and Greek these days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They don't even read the Bible anymore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right. Even now, you come across a word you don't know, and if you
                    think back to your Latin and Greek, it's just immensely valuable. So there was a
                    lot of emphasis on that. There was obviously a lot of emphasis on religion,
                    getting up at 5:30 in the morning and then go to mass. And that provided
                    interesting experiences too, because the Vatican II Council happened while we
                    were there. You know me: I always wanted to get out of something that's longer
                    and do it in a quicker way. I thought I would volunteer to say mass for one of
                    the cardinals. A lot of them were staying in the hotel next door, which was
                    nice, the Hassler Hotel. It's a nice one there in Rome. If you said mass for one
                    of the cardinals or bishops, you could get in and out. They just whipped through
                    that mass, and you'd get out in 20 minutes and could go and have your breakfast,
                    whereas otherwise if you did the regular mass, it would take 40 or 45 minutes,
                    so that was kind of nice, which is an interesting commentary on the Catholic
                    Church today. It's only now that you read in the newspaper about girls, women,
                    being allowed to serve mass in an open setting, but when it's convenient the
                    Catholic Church will make do, but back in the '60s...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, they didn't find it was any problem to having a girl saying
                    mass. That's what they could get. It just goes to show that even though the
                    Catholic Church is often, and often rightly, accused of being so rigid, they can
                    bend when it suits their interests. I was there three years as a day student and
                    then two years as a boarder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to Prague at all when your father was
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: For vacations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Prague? This would be in the
                        '60s. It was not a happy place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, this was in the early '60s. It was not a happy place. Relations
                    were very tense between us, the United States, and the Czech government. My
                    father, as I said earlier, used to play golf, and there were a number of nice
                    golf courses in the vicinity, within a couple hours' drive from Prague, and so
                    we would go and I would always caddy for him. So he and I would go off together
                    and such. The favorite sort of ploy would be, of course, whenever there was a
                    spat between the two countries, to put the golf courses off limits. Well, he was
                    the only one that played, so the official retribution ended up being a rather
                    personal one in that sense. Yes, things were rather tense at the time. We were
                    teenagers at that point, but we weren't allowed to go around by ourselves very
                    much because of the fear that something could happen, and there was an awful lot
                    of checking in and “Where are you going?” and “When you get there, call me,” and
                    all this sort of stuff, which had not been the case when we were in Rome,
                    because Rome was a pretty safe city in terms of personal safety. There was a lot
                    of ugliness in Prague in terms of the construction of buildings, but it was the
                    same as you were seeing all over Eastern Europe. Actually we went to Havana in
                    February and, interestingly enough, you see the same sort of gray concrete
                    buildings there that you see in Eastern Europe. Stores were bare. There wasn't
                    anything to buy. It was very cold, not very much in the way of heating, and what
                    heating there was was produced by brown coal, which I guess in the years since
                    has been the source of the forests dying out. What do they call it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Acid rain.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Acid rain, exactly, and the whole problems that we hear about in
                    terms of the Black Forest and others. I can remember my parents, if they needed
                    to have a serious conversation, regardless, I think, whether it was about
                    official stuff or family stuff, would walk outside in the garden. While we were
                    there, a microphone was discovered in one of the logs in my father's office,
                    which I think DS still has on exhibit. I saw it one time. It's somewhere around
                    the Department. So there was always sort of that not fear but the bothersome
                    nature of somebody knowing that the servants in the house were reporting. As
                    children it didn't bother us too much, except that it did penetrate because the
                    family structure, the family modus operandi, was different, because I guess my
                    parents would be looking for that kind of thing. Let me think what else about
                    Prague. We used to ride the trams. There wasn't much traffic there. That was
                    another interesting thing. If you're coming up and you want to make a left turn,
                    you just make a left turn, just sort of pull out in the intersection and go left
                    in this country. At the time there was so little vehicular traffic in Prague
                    that in order to turn left what people would do was swing to the right and put
                    themselves at the head of the oncoming flow of traffic, wait till the light
                    changed for that particular flow of traffic, and then go. I doubt they'd be
                    doing that, but there were all kinds of very strange things like that that were
                    going on that spoke to the backwardness of the society, not the culture, because
                    it has a very fine culture and Czechoslovakia was always very steeped in
                    culture. The house we lived in, the house which is still the residence, was one
                    of three owned by a family called Pechek, who were very wealthy industrialists,
                    as I understand it, had their own railroad and used their own railroad and
                    railroad cars to escape when the Nazis were coming in and ended up in upper New
                    York. But the three residences - one is the Soviet, Russian now, one the
                    Chinese, and one the US - are all built in the shape of a crescent, and they're
                    all built fairly much along the same plan, and the gardens are all the same plan
                    and such, by various members of this family, which is kind of an interesting
                    story. They were beautiful. Ours, I think, was the nicest, as I heard it, the
                    United States' one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family, your father, at all worried about you -
                        and I'm speaking of you in the plural - not getting sort of an American
                        education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, I don't think that bothered him. It don't think it bothered him
                    because he hadn't gotten an American education, and I don't think it bothered my
                    mother because she'd been home schooled until she went to college, so they
                    didn't look at it the way perhaps most Americans would have. Now, it did get to
                    be a problem, and the reason I only stayed two years as a boarder was at that
                    point I could hardly speak English and I would write home in Italian. There were
                    four kids and the pattern was different for each of us. My oldest sister had
                    gone to French school, French language school, and she had already come back to
                    the States to a boarding school to sort of take the exams for college, and my
                    parents decided that I should come back for junior year in high school because I
                    couldn't speak English anymore, or write it for that matter. So this was - let's
                    see; I graduated in '66.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I went to another Sacred Heart school north of Philadelphia, same
                    nuns, just north of Philadelphia, a place called Eden Hall, which is since
                    defunct, and I spent two years there as a boarder and would go to my mother's
                    sister for vacations, except for the summer when I would go back to Prague
                    still. And that was all right. I did well there. I didn't like it. It seemed as
                    though all the other kids were either foreigners, from Central or Latin America,
                    or came from broken homes of one sort of another. It's just not that much an
                    American tradition, I guess, to do the boarding school routine. But anyway,
                    everything passes, and I finished there in '66 and went to Georgetown that
                    fall.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been in one of the first groups of girls to
                        go there, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: At Georgetown?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, there weren't very many in my class. Again, the whole
                    university/college system here is so different from Europe. I didn't know much
                    about it, and I didn't know that there were probably an infinite number of
                    things one could do as an adult, nor did I realize that there was an infinite
                    number, a large number, of colleges, universities, technical schools or
                    whatever. I didn't have any idea what the options were. My father had been to
                    Georgetown for a semester or two, so I knew about that. In the Foreign Service
                    we spent most of our time socially with non-embassy people whose parents didn't
                    really figure in the equation of the children, if you will. So the only thing I
                    knew that adults did was to be in the Foreign Service. So I have Georgetown
                    because my father went there for a couple semesters, and my oldest sister went
                    to the same college my mother had been to, Manhattanville in Westchester County,
                    and I had zero knowledge of anything else, so I applied to the two of them for
                    this program - I don't know if they still do it - early admission, where you get
                    admitted in your junior year in high school and then you commit to them and then
                    you can essentially put the whole thing behind you. So I did that, and they came
                    back and said, “Fine,” and so I said, “All right, I'll go to Georgetown,
                    Georgetown Foreign Service School” and put it out of my mind and went on and
                    enjoyed everyday life. It's hard to say looking back would you do it over again.
                    It's been a great life, but I can't say that I had this passion that was going
                    to be satisfied.</p>

                        that one thinks of so often because of their various prep facilities and the
                        School of Foreign Service and all. So many people have gone through it,
                        maybe just for a few months or for years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, but, you know, my class, my undergraduate class, which was
                    foreign service, only one other person came into the Foreign Service, and he's
                    still here. He and I actually came into the Foreign Service in the same class as
                    well, which I thought was strange. All the rest went on to be lawyers or some
                    were bankers and some did things that were just not related to the Foreign
                    Service at all, international relations at all.</p>

                        different and freer than having been sort of under the rules of the

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Than under the rules of the nuns, yes, obviously it was. The first
                    year I was there I lived on campus in a dorm, and it was definitely much freer,
                    rather unnerving given how confining, if you will, my background had been, and
                    confining not just physically but culturally. That was a big shock. I didn't
                    feel at all comfortable with my peers in terms of what was going on socially,
                    and politically I didn't have a clue, and culturally I didn't have a clue what
                    was going on. I really felt like a foreigner.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, a lot were rich kids, very wealthy kids from Central America
                    and that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not usual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, that doesn't have a great touch with reality. It was very
                    strange, and I felt very much out of place at Georgetown. In terms of overseas
                    exposure, what seemed normal to me, did not seem normal to my friends at
                    Georgetown, and what seemed normal to them was just bizarre. I've talked with
                    other Foreign Service brats about that, and it's something that I don't know
                    that you can ever catch up on, if your adolescent years are in a foreign
                    environment. That's not to say that going to an American school overseas is a
                    foreign environment. That can be pretty much as good as being here in the
                    States. But ours was not that at all. I don't know that you can ever kind of
                    catch up, and even now my husband will say, “You're a foreigner. Why did they
                    let you in the Foreign Service? You don't know who that is,” that movie star or
                    '50s song or '60s. It's one of those things that I don't know that you can ever
                    catch up on. It's not really important in terms of the essence of life, but when
                    you're young, when you're in your late teens or even early 20s, I think, it can
                    be rather a jarring sort of experience. But Georgetown was still at that time
                    very much a Catholic institution. I don't think it's that way...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, and the atmosphere, I don't think, is that of a Catholic.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, it's a very different place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: and they have debates on abortion and

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: And there is this whole debate going on about Catholic institutions
                    of higher learning and just what is the basic tenet that implies you can call
                    yourself a Catholic institution versus just a general academic institution. I
                    think Georgetown's kind of in the lead of that debate, not surprising with the
                    Jesuits. But at the time, back in the early '60s, it was still very much of the
                    Catholic flavor. Yes, you mentioned the Vietnam War. That was going on around
                    and certainly Georgetown was very active. I remember participating in a number
                    of demonstrations. Again, I think I was fairly naive politically, not that I
                    probably would have felt differently about the war, but just the whole role of
                    demonstrations and the political process and such was something that I didn't
                    know very much about. My friends were very competitive academically, and I
                    certainly was not. I think they were all very competitive, very challenged
                    people to succeed, and they all have. So it's kind of interesting. We're a
                    nucleus; we have about 10 who were focused on the Foreign Service and
                    international relations and being abroad and such like that. Interestingly
                    enough, we've stayed in close touch for the most part.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it being a girl in an institution which was still
                        not really - now I think it's more than 50 percent...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, I think you're right. At the time there were very few of us.
                    You know, Georgetown, again at the time - I don't know what it's like now - has
                    various schools, the business school, the college for language, foreign service,
                    whatever, and the schools were to a large extent separate and the female-male
                    ratio was quite different in different ones in the school. For example, the
                    nursing school was all women; foreign service was maybe a quarter women
                    beginning with our class. I didn't really think about it, because I had always
                    been in girls' schools, so it really wasn't an issue. I certainly hadn't been
                    exposed to any debate about women's issues, having grown up overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the first time you were in a really American
                        institution. Were you doing anything to get Americanized?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, I was just trying to survive. I found the course work very
                    difficult. I found the writing very difficult, writing in English. As you know,
                    romance languages are just not different languages, as you probably know, but
                    it's a whole cultural thing. An Italian or Spanish or French sentence will go on
                    for five lines; an English sentence will probably go on for only one and a half
                    lines. So it was a very different way of thinking, and I found that was
                    difficult since I was used to what was not the accepted way. I didn't feel very
                    comfortable there at all. I felt comfortable with my friends, but I didn't feel
                    very comfortable with the institution because - I don't know why - there were
                    just too many things that were just unknown or strange for a foreigner and it
                    was a lot to cope with. Now, the first year, as I say, I lived on campus, which
                    was really, as you pointed out, just being thrown into the milieu of this
                    American environment. After that I did not live on campus. My parents were here.
                    I don't know why I lived on campus, but I did that first year. But my parents
                    were back here at that point. Anyway, I left for my junior year abroad, and I
                    went back to Rome. I went to Loyola College, or University I guess it is, in
                    Rome for junior year and then actually debated not going back. But, what the
                    hell, one more year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find going back to Italy after being
                        away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's an interesting question, because that time going back to
                    Italy at Loyola I was with a bunch of Americans. So I was with Americans in
                    Italy as opposed to before being with Italians in Italy. It was nice to be able
                    to share what I knew about the city and the culture and the people and such with
                    friends there at Loyola. It was also nice to be there on my own, because my
                    parents at that point were down in Sicily, they weren't in Rome. That was a very
                    satisfying year. It was also nice to be able to look at cultural and artistic
                    monuments as an adult, if you will, as opposed to being dragged around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I imagine this would have allowed you to be more of
                        a leader too. You knew the language, you'd been around the block, so people
                        would look to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's right, exactly, and it was very nice to be able to share it
                    with them and to appreciate it myself as an adult as opposed to a child being
                    dragged around. “Now it's Sunday, and this Sunday we'll do this church or this
                    museum or whatever it was.” That was a very satisfying year. I enjoyed that a
                    lot, and I did a bit of traveling with friends around Italy and around Europe
                    actually. It was nice, and then, what the hell, I had one year left so I came
                    back and finished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Vietnam issue, were there a lot of debates? Was the

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, but there weren't a lot of debates, as I remember. There was a
                    lot of participation in demonstrations because, of course, Washington was a
                    focus point for demonstrations and a lot of participation. There was a lot of
                    discussion around the dorms and in small groups about the Vietnam business. I
                    don't remember debates, like formal debates in the auditorium.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, no. You see, that's one of the things that I would still say
                    back at that time it was very much a Catholic institution, and good Catholics in
                    the old days used to do what they were told, follow the rules. It's very much
                    sort of a dogmatic approach. And I think there was a large bit of that at least
                    still left. I may be wrong, but I don't remember that kind of stuff going
                    on.</p>

                        have a lot of students from other places coming and you'd be putting them up
                        and all that. Did you run into much of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I didn't. It may well have gone on, but in my group of friends I
                    don't remember that. I do remember people used to play very hard at Georgetown,
                    so while it was perhaps quite active in demonstrations, Vietnam and civil rights
                    as well, people used to play really hard too. A lot of drinking went on.</p>
                <p>

                        serious concern about the drinking. Did you find this was a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, not in our group. I'd been drinking since I was 15. We always
                    had wine. We had wine at Sunday lunch and we had wine in the evening. Again,
                    that whole very American thing about drinking and you can do it when you're 18
                    or 21 was something again that was very strange to me. I remember parties, yes,
                    and there was booze there and, yes, I can remember people getting drunk. I can't
                    remember this obscene kind of drunkenness that you hear about today, not to say
                    that perhaps it didn't happen, although I don't remember ever hearing about
                    somebody dying from binge drinking as has been the case in the last four years.
                    Yes, people got drunk and they probably got sick and they probably drove when
                    they shouldn't have, but I think it was something of a different order than what
                    we're seeing today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're right, because even going back, much
                        farther back, that wasn't a problem. People got drunk, but there wasn't this
                        competitive thing to kill you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right. People got drunk but then you were dancing. I guess my
                    theory, whether it's right or wrong, is that, well, if you're dancing and you're
                    drinking, you drink and then you dance a while and you get some of it out of
                    your system, I guess. I don't know what happens at these binge drunken
                    parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they begin playing competitive. How about the
                        Foreign Service? You say not too many of your group went into it. Was there
                        a problem? Was the Foreign Service still considered a good thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, remember those were still the days - well, that was just after
                    JFK actually, that was about three or four years after JFK got killed and I
                    think there was still the spirit of patriotism and do something for your
                    government. A number of the people that I was friendly with came from less
                    advantaged, if you will, financially families where they were the first to go to
                    college or what have you. I think, perhaps understandably, for them the
                    motivation was more material, possessions, money, status, that sort of thing
                    rather than the country. I think a number of the women, almost all of the women
                    actually - except maybe two besides myself - ended up being mothers at home.
                    That sort of frame of mind was still very much in evidence there. There wasn't
                    any bad-mouthing anti-government in terms of a career. There would be
                    anti-government in terms of the policies, Vietnam, civil rights, that sort of
                    thing, but not in terms of government service. Government service was still seen
                    as an honorable occupation. I can remember my friends just sort of foaming at
                    the idea that my father was an ambassador and wanting to talk to him all the
                    time. There was a lot of pride in that they knew him and that he talked to them,
                    and I think that speaks to the way people looked at government service still in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your family? How did they feel about your going
                        into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I don't know. On the one hand my father was very traditional
                    and probably had a fair amount of 'a woman's place is in the home' business. At
                    the same time I think he was pleased that there was something in common. As
                    people he had much more in common, if you will - they were more like kindred
                    spirits - with my younger sister and my younger brother, so this was something
                    that we had in common. But his approach was very much everybody do their own
                    thing and, whatever that is, that's fine. There was never any pressure one way
                    or the other. Even with his namesake, my brother, there was never any pressure
                    to do anything similar, and he's an architect here in town and ended up going in
                    a completely different direction. I remember speaking to my mother, and for a
                    while she was against my retiring. She said, “They keep offering you embassies.
                    Why don't you go? Don't you want to be an ambassador?” I said, “No, I don't want
                    to be an ambassador. I've had it. I've done 50 years of this stuff. It's not
                    worth it to me.” “Oh, yes, well, maybe but don't you want....” It was much more
                    that she thought that was the right way. And, of course, many of my
                    contemporaries in the Service would feel the same way. “What did you bother to
                    come in for if you don't want to be an ambassador?” Well, the day-to-day
                    experiences were to me much more important than having that ultimate goal. But I
                    think she would have liked that, but at the same time, you know, she's fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you took and passed the written exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, I didn't. I took it and failed. But I was determined to be in
                    the Foreign Service, so when I graduated, I went to work in the Passport Office
                    as an apprentice. Those were the days of Frances Knight. If you haven't
                    interviewed anybody about Frances Knight, you...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I've had a lot of people, and I've even interviewed
                        Frances Knight but unfortunately it was towards the end of her compos mentos
                        time. It was about almost 12 or 13 years ago. She just died recently, but
                        she was not really with it too much. But, of course, her name is legend, as
                        was Ruth Shipley's before then. So tell me about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I started working there. I had another job after I graduated from
                    college for a bit, but then in January of '71 I started working there and I was
                    there for two and a half years before I managed to get into the Foreign Service.
                    I worked in the foreign area, which was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was called Foreign Operations, and essentially what they did
                    there was to adjudicate citizenship claims, the complicated ones, the ones the
                    posts didn't have the authority to decide. That was fascinating because they
                    were like jigsaw puzzles. There were a number of different, overlapping,
                    contradictory citizenship laws on the books. They've all been kind of wiped out
                    now. I guess in the late '70s it all changed, or '80s. But anyway, at the time
                    it was very complicated, and so you'd have these arcane cases of people born,
                    divorced, whatever in the Philippines. It was fascinating because each one was
                    sort of like a little game and you had to figure it out, and then the whole
                    puzzle sort of fell into place. So that was a lot of fun, but it was also very
                    strange because I, of course, made it very clear from the beginning that I was
                    only using the place as a stepping stone to get in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frances Knight considered the Foreign Service to be the
                        enemy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, she did, and the relationship between the Passport Office and
                    the rest of the State Department could not have been worse. If you ever wanted
                    to go over to the main building, you certainly didn't tell anybody you were
                    doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara Watson during part of that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, Barbara Watson, and they had these running duels, Barbara
                    Watson and Frances Knight. It was really quite interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with Frances Knight or any
                        stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, not too much actually, because I was obviously pretty junior
                    at that point, but I had a friend that ran the file room and there was much talk
                    about Frances Knight and her manipulation of files, if you will, for J. Edgar
                    Hoover and all that sort of business, some of which has appeared in the press, I
                    guess. So he would tell me stories about the file system, the one she kept. I
                    can't remember whose they were. She kept them in her own little safe. God knows
                    what was really going on, but she was a terror and most people there really were
                    terrorized by the woman and you minded your P's and Q's. If you didn't, you were
                    out of there pretty quick, pretty quickly. I guess I tolerated it all about a
                    year. The work itself was fun, but atmosphere was quite bizarre. Then I started
                    trying to get into the Foreign Service laterally with just the oral exam - they
                    had some program there - and that was very successful. I got right in, and then
                    I think I was in the Foreign Service class in '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall in the oral exam any of the questions asked
                        or how it went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, I remember being dreadful in economics and I remember running
                    into out in the hall - I can't remember his name - who had been on my panel.
                    He's the only one I remember and he was an econ officer. I ran into him many
                    years later and he said, “Well, how's it going, Sarah?” This was after I had
                    already gotten a number of promotions. He said, “Are you doing very well?” I
                    said, “Yes, no problem, but I'm really glad I decided not to become an economic
                    officer.” He said, “Yes, I would have voted on that one. That was definitely not
                    your strong suit.” We got to be friendly. He was a nice guy, although I can't
                    remember his name. I remember a lot of questions about history and international
                    relations, which didn't trouble me at all. The ones that did bother me, not
                    surprisingly, were the ones about cultural life in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel like there was a certain emphasis, saying, “I
                        see you went to school here and there. Let's talk about America.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, it wasn't put that way. It was just, “Let's talk about this
                    school of painting or whatever.” I guess the arts aren't my strong point. I'm
                    not terribly interested in them anyway, and certainly I wasn't going to be
                    interested in the United States, but ask me about the Renaissance. “You've lived
                    in Italy. Tell me about the Renaissance.” No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hudson school of painting was not your bag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, I didn't know anything about it. Those were kind of amusing. But
                    it went on for a couple of hours, and for the most part it was rather pleasant.
                    I can't complain. And I didn't know the economics stuff. It had been my worst
                    subject when I was at Georgetown. I hated it, and so I wasn't at all surprised
                    when this guy - I wish I could remember his name; it'll come to me - said that
                    to me later. I thought, yes, right, not surprised, at least he saw through that
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was towards the end of '73, December or November '73. Again, I
                    went out very early. I went out in February to my first post. Most people then
                    came into a Foreign Service class and then stayed around as a class for probably
                    a good six months between taking, of course, the junior officer course and then
                    language and then the consulate business went on for weeks and weeks and weeks.
                    I didn't, because I already had languages and I already had the consular stuff,
                    because I had done it all sort of on the side while I was at the Passport
                    Office. I had done the visa. I had done everything just for interest. Since I
                    had already been in the State Department and these other people hadn't, I could
                    do it. That was too bad in a way, because I think classes tend to coalesce.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Again very few women, I'd say maybe four or five women. All the guys
                    - not all but most of them - went to Vietnam. I've always regretted actually
                    that I didn't. I don't think they were sending women to Vietnam at that point,
                    maybe they never were, but I always regretted not pushing, pressing the issue
                    and trying to go there and actually getting there, because I think, especially
                    for somebody like me that spent so much time overseas, that was such a pivotal
                    issue for our generation. I still feel today that it would have been very nice,
                    very interesting to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vietnam was running down too by '73. They had called back
                        sort of the Vietnamese-trained officers. Junior officers I don't think were
                        going out particularly then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: A good number of ours did. Maybe it's just the ones that were single
                    at that point. I don't know; I just remember it was an issue for the class. I
                    can even remember one guy, who was dreadfully opposed to the policy, actually
                    resigned right then and there because he was supposed to go to Vietnam and said,
                    “I'm not going,” right there. God knows what he's done in the meantime. I do
                    know that a fair number were still going. I'm sure it wasn't like five, eight
                    years earlier when entire classes were sent to Vietnam. But I do feel that that
                    was a missed opportunity. It was such a central issue for our generation, and
                    since I had been overseas for much of the civil rights thing and actually much
                    of the Vietnam thing, I just think that I could have learned a lot about this
                    country and the way it worked by having had some more direct involvement, but
                    there we are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know the old Civil War expression, “Go out and see the

                        because I wanted to see the elephant, I wanted to see what this was all
                        about. I was Counselor General in Saigon from '69 to '70, about 18 months.
                        It was interesting. I'm glad I did. This was a major issue, and you kind of
                        like to be on the scene.</hi>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, it provides a different level of understanding than just
                    reading about it. I understand things better if I can experience them rather
                    than just reading about them. Also, there was so much unhappiness amongst many
                    of the FSOs that had been in Vietnam when they came back. I think it would have
                    been easier to understand. My husband, when he discusses it, has often said,
                    “You know, you're out there” - he was with Core - “and you're managing this
                    program and these troops and whatever, and you have all this responsibility and
                    it really is life and death.” Then his next assignment was coming back to SS. He
                    said, “And now they want me to clean out the toilets and clip hedges.” And each
                    person would have had a different experience in Vietnam.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It's hard to understand that unless you can appreciate the
                    responsibility that those people had and the environment in which they worked in
                    Vietnam. If you weren't there, forget it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question, and then we'll stop for the day. At the
                        time you came in, was there the married woman's issue? What were you
                        getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: God knows. I don't remember ever paying it any mind at all. Maybe
                    that was something that had to do with my father's initial ambivalence about my
                    coming in. Didn't they change the rule in the mid-'70s?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was around the time you came in. It had never been
                        actually a rule; it had been just a custom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, really? I thought it was a Personnel regulation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it might have been, but there was no law. It had
                        acquired the ambiance or patina of law, but it wasn't really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I don't remember ever thinking about it, but then again I never
                    really thought about getting married either, so it was not germane.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is interesting, just as an aside. Was there a change?
                        In earlier generation coming through college, with most young women the main
                        idea was you wanted to get the MRS degree. But by the time you came through
                        this was kind of over? Women were thinking, “I'm going to work.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I'm going to work. Yes, at least with my group of friends there
                    wasn't any of this “Let me see about getting married.” Yes, everybody had their
                    boyfriends or what have you or had broken up or were kind of on the rebound or
                    whatever, but the main focus was in fact much like the men, getting a job. In
                    fact, most of my group went on and got graduate degrees right away and then
                    started working - I didn't do that till later - law degrees, political science,
                    Ph.D.s, whether they were male or female. There wasn't this emphasis on getting
                    married. I don't know if in the United States as a whole the average age at
                    which women were getting married was already rising.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It would make sense. Why would this group have been so
                    different?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, we're talking about a college-educated

                <p>This is the 26th of July 2000. Sarah, you're off to Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. You
                    were there from '73 to when?</p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, actually it was from '74 till the middle of '76. No, you're
                    right. It was '73, because it was a three-year assignment in the end. I extended
                    for a year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation on Trinidad when you went there?
                        Can you give me sort of a feel for the politics and the economy and American
                        interests there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, just about everything was affected by the economy because
                    Trinidad, of course, has oil. The price of oil, I can't remember exactly what it
                    was back then, but it was high, so they were living high on the hog. In terms of
                    politics the government was controlled by a Eric Williams. Trinidad got
                    independence, I believe, in the late '60s, so they hadn't been an independent
                    country for terribly long. Eric Williams' approach to life was sell oil, and he
                    was very anti-US, saw the United States as essentially exploiting countries such
                    as his. He had two policies that stick in my mind. I'm sure there were plenty
                    more, but the ones that stick in my mind were that he would not permit tourism
                    development on the island. He didn't need it so much because, of course, they
                    had the oil revenue at the time, but he did not want Americans coming down and
                    living in a tourist fashion. He also wanted to export whatever unemployment he
                    had to the United States, which is interesting because, of course, that then
                    became a big issue with Mexico. It still is today in terms of exporting and
                    exploiting unemployed people. But Trinidad was pretty calm in those days. It has
                    had some periods of unrest since. I guess from a political standpoint it wasn't
                    terribly interesting. I was a visa officer, as I suppose almost everybody is on
                    their first post, and I enjoyed it. Trinidadians are very open, warm people,
                    very educated. Actually it was the first experience I had had living in a
                    non-Caucasian culture. Trinidad, as you know, is almost 50 percent black,
                    Afro-American if you will, and 50 percent East Indian. That was an interesting
                    experience for me. But all were very well educated and mostly, a high
                    percentage, living in the city. Already it was starting then for folks leaving
                    the farms, so there were still a good crop. A small embassy...</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I just don't know. With the series of political appointees, I
                    just don't know. There were, I think, 3 ambassadors during my tour, so none of
                    them must have stayed very long.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we handle the visa problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, most days I would just say no. There wasn't as much. I
                    suppose, as in so many walks of life today, there's a lot of doing things right.
                    Even with children and education and discipline, it's quite different than it
                    was 25 years ago, and I suppose the way one handled visas in those days
                    reflected the society at large. It was, I think, easier to say no without having
                    a lot of explanation required than it probably is today. There was a bit of an
                    informal economy, which is often very difficult to measure, as, I suppose, in so
                    many less developed countries, because the people just don't have the normal
                    objectives or things you look for as ties to the country. I guess the highest
                    percentage of no's went to Indians because they were primarily agricultural and
                    had a tradition - perhaps as they do in India; I don't know - of kind of
                    safeguarding their wealth in jewels, in gold jewelry, and so it was very
                    difficult for these officers. Another group that was difficult to tell but were
                    very good risks, as I found over time, were government employees, who earned
                    next to nothing, such as most of their teachers, earned next to nothing but had
                    such good benefits once one looked into it, that comparable salary and benefits
                    packages in the States would not have been comparable enough in the financial
                    sense. It was still a fairly stratified society, so one could assess groupings.
                    I remember playing carniway, at the carnival because Trinidad is a big carnival
                    place, and they had what they called bands, which are masses of, say, hundreds
                    of people in groups of 30 or 40 with an overall theme, and each group of 30 or
                    40 would represent one aspect of whatever the theme of the band is. I remember
                    the expression there is 'playing mats' as in playing matchsticks - they use that
                    expression - and I did this several years running. There were always newspaper
                    articles about the visa officer plays mats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: You mean with the carnival?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, one would join a band, as they call it. The band had a theme,
                    and there were rival bands, generally run by artistic folks. Each band had a
                    theme, and then these smaller groups of, say, 30 or 40 people would kind of pick
                    one element. You would go to the band store, and depending on what your price
                    range is, you'd end up in one sort of grouping or another - it was generally
                    dictated by price - and so you got your costume. Then on the appointed days you
                    went off with your band and everybody danced in the streets in the carnival to
                    the calypso music and drank rum under the hot sun. That was the thing to do, and
                    it was a lot of fun. Everybody did it; Trinidadians from all walks of life did
                    it. Sort of all barriers came down, and it was really a leveling and sort of
                    unifying experience for the whole country, and persists today. They probably
                    have them in Washington now. They have the Trinidad carnival up in Adams Morgan.
                    I've not been but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Calypso music, of course, particularly shortly after the
                        war and during the war, was very popular in the United States. I think of
                        Lord Invader and some of these other people...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was, and I think the United States adopted a rather simple kind
                    of calypso music. Calypso, calypso music, by and large, the lyrics to their
                    music is generally of a political satire nature. It's very difficult to
                    appreciate each year's calypsos unless you've been a part of the society,
                    because it just sort of grows out of whatever's been happening in the country
                    that year. The ones, I think, that we got early on in the United States were all
                    about women and men and sun, and love and things like, more than
                    political...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rum and Coca Cola was kind of that ilk, that type of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: But if you really knew what was going on in the society, they're
                    absolutely fabulous. Well, there was an interesting thing too on that point,
                    because while the society revolved around carnival and calypso competitions and
                    stuff, the folks didn't make any money. Many of the better known calypsonians
                    actually came to the United States and Canada to practice their other-than-music
                    professions. They had other, more regular professions and oftentimes left the
                    island completely just to make money.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: There would be regular articles about the embassy and policies and
                    such, but it didn't translate in terms of interfering or with hostility by the
                    general population. It was almost a personnel thing, which is interesting
                    because I think at least one or two of his children were born here and raised
                    here in the United States, but I guess that's not unusual.</p>

                        very high-placed people in the United States because they weren't getting

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Very, very easy to mix. I found Trinidadians, people just like
                    Trinidadians. The Indian ones were still at that time more agriculturally based
                    and therefore not as present in the city and very much family oriented. Black
                    Trinidadians formed the government and were more numerous by far in the city and
                    very open. I suppose there was prejudice there, but I certainly didn't feel it
                    and never had any trouble making friends with blacks. Whatever prejudice there
                    was overwhelmingly between the blacks and Indians. They had strong dislike for
                    each other, and a resident sort of British group. There was a lot of animosity
                    toward them, but their numbers were so small that it really didn't permeate. I
                    remember the country club. The country club was, I think if I'm not mistaken,
                    still all white, which was a farce because there just weren't any whites. It was
                    pretty absurd. But the yacht club, I had a little Sunfish and I learned to play
                    golf, went out there every day, and none of those places were in the least bit
                    of that nature. Trinidadians like to party and like socializing and would have
                    all-day events where people would come and go, dancing and all, very casual,
                    very laid back. They're an open people. I had lots of friends there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds like they almost had to pry you out of
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: As I said, I did extend for a year, and I enjoyed it very much. I
                    suppose everybody enjoys their first post. People seemed to have a certain
                    fondness....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Learning the ropes and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Learning the ropes, and you're young and you don't have much
                    responsibility. I had a lot of fun. I did a lot of traveling when I was there
                    all over the country, and at that time they had great incentives. If you're a
                    resident of CARICOM, you could get like 60 percent off airlines and hotel rates
                    during the off season, so it was very inexpensive. So I went almost everywhere,
                    the former British places in the Caribbean. It must not have been very expensive
                    because I was a vice consul so I wasn't making very much. I don't know, I can't
                    remember, but it must have been pretty inexpensive. But anyway, I came back to
                    Washington and I worked in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. I came back because a
                    friend of mine, Laurent Morin, said I had to leave Trinidad at some point and
                    said he was forming this special or new sort of R&amp;D unit to figure out how
                    to do consular affairs more efficiently or something, and would I join this
                    operation, which I did then. So I came back to do that, and then that all
                    fizzled after the three of us got assembled. That fizzled rather quickly, and he
                    went off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: London, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It might have been London, or Jamaica.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: He was ambassador to Jamaica, but I think that was later. I think it
                    was London. I went to stay with him in Jamaica, and I think...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe he was Consul General to London.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: He must have gone off to London at that point. Well, anyway, nobody
                    else quite knew what to do at this point, so it all sort of fizzled. Then I
                    became staff assistant and press officer for CA (Consular Affairs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of CA at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Barbara Watson. Press business didn't make too much difference in
                    those days. Consular Affairs wasn't getting that much press and probably didn't
                    see all that much about public relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from '76 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I did it from '76 to '78 I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about Barbara Watson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I can't remember that much about her position on policy or what have
                    you. Many evenings after the work was done we'd sit around her office and talk
                    about the old days in Harlem, and that was fascinating. Her family came from the
                    elite of Harlem, and there were so many fabulous artists in Harlem in the days
                    she was growing up. It was a real treat to be able to sit there and hear stories
                    about Harlem in the good old days. She was an interesting woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever hear about her and dealing within your
                        department and Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: She had very good ties with Congress. Who were her special people
                    there... I can't remember. But she had very close links, positive, warm links
                    with several members of Congress that were involved in immigration issues, and I
                    can't remember who they were. She had equally frigid relations with J. Edgar
                    Hoover and Frances Knight, which provoked any number scenes of fights,
                    bureaucratic and otherwise, back and forth. I started off actually in the
                    Passport Office, and so I sort of came from having seen it from a very junior
                    level obviously. I was still serving in the Passport Office, having seen these
                    fights between Frances Knight and the rest of the State Department generally
                    embodied in the person of Barbara Watson. So when I was there with Barbara
                    Watson I saw it on the other side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there really were practically no relations with the
                        press.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, the two of them didn't talk. I don't know how it worked from a
                    policy standpoint. It's difficult for anybody, and I'm not even sure that
                    Frances might have called on the Secretary of State. When I was in the Passport
                    Office, I remember people treating me as a pariah when I decided I wanted to go
                    in the Foreign Service I mean things were that frigid and distant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In working with Barbara Watson in the Counselor Bureau,
                        there must have been a lot of Congressional pressure to issue visas, to do
                        this, do things for Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, I don't know that there was that much. Now, it may just be
                    remembering wrong. I just read recently about the phenomenal explosion in
                    travel, particularly overseas travel by Americans, and they'd always take me by
                    surprise, because the period of time in which this happened is generally
                    referred to as the last 20 years. So I sort of think that I have to be careful
                    in not attributing the current things that happen to what was going on 20 years
                    ago. I don't know how many Americans really were traveling overseas in the
                    mid-'70s and to what extent there was any trouble. As I remember the Bureau in
                    those days, the focus was much more on immigration, and Mexico was a big issue.
                    I remember organizing several conferences for Bureau principals to go down to
                    southern California and Texas and try to do sort of outreach explaining the
                    immigration laws and addressing the question of illegal immigration even then. I
                    just don't remember that much went on as a regular sort of thing. I remember,
                    who was that actor, I think it could have been Kris Kristofferson. I remember
                    there was enough going on about drugs, Americans and drugs overseas, at the same
                    time that movie came out about the American in a Turkish jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Midnight Express.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Midnight Express, right. I remember we somehow organized Kris
                    Kristofferson to do some public service announcement about drug use overseas. It
                    was good that there was some of that going on, but I just don't remember a whole
                    lot of that going on. Now that part of her review that deals with American
                    citizens and services is enormous, and I just don't remember it being that much
                    of a thing. [Inaudible.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel at that time that you were part of a
                        counselor corps or was this just another assignment as opposed to being sort
                        of a general Foreign Service Officer and getting out of it and doing
                        something else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I didn't give it much thought. It's the same sort of thing when
                    people ask if I encountered discrimination in the Foreign Service, so I never
                    really gave it much thought. I guess I sort of got blinders on, and just march
                    on and do my own thing. Now, I did when I came into the Foreign Service and when
                    I came in as a consular officer and certainly while working as an FSO in the
                    Passport Office. The three years or two and a half years I was there before I
                    became an FSO certainly made me an expert on passport and citizenship law, and
                    then, of course, Trinidad and the visa and end of things, so maybe it did. But
                    when I left there, I left CA and went into admin work. I don't remember it being
                    a conscious big-deal thing. I wanted to try something other than consular
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you say relations between Barbara and the people
                        she supervised?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, from where I sat people liked her. It was different if you're
                    in a front office, of course, than if you had some other office in the Bureau.
                    But again, unlike today, I think the Bureau - it would be interesting if one
                    knew the numbers - I always thought that the Bureau was much smaller then,
                    especially since you have to kind of forget from the calculations the whole
                    passport operation at that time. But even in the other two were much smaller
                    than they are now, so it was a much more close-knit operation than now. In terms
                    of her relations with the rest of the Department, I think the closest bureau
                    that we were having the most problems with immigration, legal and illegal. And
                    actually that's one of the reasons why I went over there, because Bob
                    Gershenson, who was the resident director there at the time, was particularly
                    sensitive to all these visa processing public relations issues. We had started
                    working together on what he called consular assistance teams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CAT</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: CAT, exactly, and he was really positive and he would set aside
                    certain sums of money, and the idea was to try to go out to go out to a problem
                    post A, B, or C, figure out what needed to be done, gain the sort of acceptance
                    and participation of the people there, American and FSN and knowing that there
                    was money to fix it, if you needed whatever if you needed new furniture, but
                    more importantly if you needed more structure in order to push people in one way
                    or the other to make them more efficient when they needed training, then the
                    money was a guarantee Well, I don't know if that's ever been done where the
                    money is set aside before you had a solution, and it made an enormous difference
                    in terms of getting the cooperation and involvement of the people on site and,
                    of course, getting the job done. But that didn't last more than a year or
                    two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of Ron Somerville at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Ron's very nice. He's almost Machiavellian. I have never in my life
                    met anybody who could maneuver the bureaucracy. He knew where so many bones were
                    buried, and he's so clever at maneuvering people on issues to further advance to
                    his mark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always thought he was a very effective person to have
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The counselor package was quite important, because I think
                        we were the only part of the Department that could quantify...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's right, and we were enormously successful in getting money in
                    because of that, money that was needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was the game, but we would show that there is
                        growth in this and this and this and that we're doing it with so many
                        people. It broke down very nicely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, and if I remember correctly, that was his idea. But, you
                    know, Ron was full of good ideas, but the overwhelming thing was his ability to
                    move through that bureaucracy. I have never seen anything like it since. In
                    fact, I worked for Ron years later, well about the late 80's. In the late '80s I
                    worked over there and I was still as impressed as I had been in the very
                    beginning</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he work with Barbara Watson?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, extremely well. I think she trusted him implicitly. Of course,
                    you know, then there was the question of who was really running the show with
                    Ron, because he definitely had his own agenda. Barbara Watson was a smart lady,
                    a lawyer, if I remember correctly. She was an attorney, and she very much
                    enjoyed the job and the issues. I don't know if she was as dedicated as Ron was
                    to the issues of the Bureau. Wasn't she there twice?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was there twice, yes. She was then at the very end was
                        ambassador to Malaysia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: She did go as ambassador?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, for a little while. Really before this period I
                        remember she came to Athens. She was sort of a granddame. She had things
                        just right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, that's right, because she did appreciate things that were just
                    right and she would change it if things weren't quite right. She enjoyed having
                    men around her too. I can't imagine her ever having a front office for women
                    ambassadors even if it were today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Compared to what we have now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right. But she liked having gentlemen around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, she was appreciated. As a consular officer I felt we
                        had a friend in court for the first time. Before it had been sort of an
                        ethnic political dumping ground for people. They'd put in a Polish person or
                        Jewish person or Irish person or something like this, and they would say
                        there were close to immigration and had given that as sort of a bone tossed
                        for the political process. And then she came in and I think they thought
                        they were getting a black person, and they weren't. They were getting a
                        queen who had a far greater role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: And then did have interest in the subject. Yes, she was good for CA,
                    I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '78 somebody must have been breathing down your
                        neck and saying Sarah you are on your way somewhere or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, no, we had formed these consular assistance teams, and so then
                    I went over to ARA because that was the one bureau that was given and put their
                    money where their mouth was, but in the person of Bob Richardson. So I went over
                    there and did that for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be '78-'79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, about that. Then I was also post management officer for
                    Panama. The consular assistance teams, I guess Bob Richardson, moved on to
                    something else. Again, that sort of fizzled in terms of the money, the guarantee
                    of money. Without the guarantee of money, the concept sort of fell flat. Sort of
                    like inspectors or whoever, we just never knew if it was really going to come to
                    pass or when, and that made the involvement by local folks much more attenuate.
                    So then I did regular post management stuff and never really got thrilled about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I did that during the same period, more business stuff. I really
                    never enjoyed it. And so, at the end, I went for leave without pay, and I guess
                    we left in September of '79 and I went out West to Thunderbird.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I was considering leaving, yes, but the immediate purpose was
                    to get a master's in business administration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Thunderbird. Now it's called something different. Before it used to
                    be called Thunderbird.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Arizona</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Just north of Phoenix. It was on the site an Air Force base. I think
                    that's where it gets its name. Now it's called something else. It's called
                    American Graduate School of International Management. It started off as a
                    business management school with a different philosophy and a different
                    orientation. It was always focused towards overseas business as opposed to most
                    business schools in the States. It started off focused on just Latin America. It
                    also had a different approach in that it was very practically oriented as
                    opposed to the theoretical approach of some of the Eastern business schools,
                    which again has been abandoned in the last 40 years, but certainly in the
                    beginning it was much more theoretical. But I thought it would be nice and I had
                    never been west of the Appalachians and the focus on Latin America was
                    interesting to me. So I did that. And in those things in the Department, it was
                    pretty routine that you could get leave without pay. Not so now, I gather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of looking around for another job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, I thought I might not come back. I wasn't looking for a job at
                    the time, but I was kind of bored, bored with the State Department, certainly
                    bored with the admin work. At the end of that year I did interview with a number
                    of companies, and then I found that the people I was interviewing with were
                    places that I would have been doing very similar work to the Foreign Service
                    only I would be starting at the bottom. At that point my time in State
                    Department was only about 10 years. I thought to myself “Why are you going to do
                    the same sort of thing somewhere else and start off at the bottom and throw away
                    10 years. If you want to kind of do the same thing, you might as well stick with
                    what you got and go back to the State Department.” And so I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in '81 what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: So in January of '81 I went off to Honduras as consul general. Well,
                    I wasn't actually consul general right away. I went off as number-two for three
                    months or six months until the consul general left, and then I was consul
                    general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Honduras from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: January of '81 until about June or so of '84.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sort of political economic situation in
                        Honduras at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, that was very interesting, because the whole Contra operation,
                    the whole Nicaraguan operation, was just starting, and no one else in the
                    embassy could talk to these insurgents because at that time we didn't have a
                    policy of supporting them. I think the Argentines were supporting them. But we
                    didn't. So the only folks in the embassy couldn't have any dealings with these
                    people, but we could in the consular section, and so they would come in for
                    visas. So everybody would slip me these list of questions and, “If so-and-so
                    comes in, find out this that and everything.” It made it very interesting,
                    because to a large extent we were where the action was. The nice thing about
                    consular work, in my experience, was that if you did the job well, everybody
                    would leave you alone, which was nice, not to have people breathing down your
                    neck, and not to be in a position I found when I was later a political counselor
                    as being the ambassador's staff aide essentially. But the other nice thing about
                    consular work was that you could think very creatively about the situation you
                    were in and almost anything you wanted to get into you really could, because
                    there was very little that would be going on that didn't somehow relate to
                    protecting Americans or figuring out who was leading the country and why and
                    how, and so it gave enormous scope for getting into society and really doing the
                    formatting of different things. It gave a freedom that, as I looked at
                    colleagues in other sections, I never quite saw duplicated in other
                    sections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government of Honduras like from your
                        perspective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Honduras never had the disparity between rich and poor that's so
                    typical of other countries in Latin America and particularly Central America.
                    They are sort of mediocre. At that point they were stable, unlike other
                    countries. At least in 1981 there weren't any strong leftist inclinations. What
                    they wanted was money, money for development. There was a large amount of
                    corruption. And there was an almost exclusive focus on the United States
                    politically, socially, economically. The country was dominated economically by
                    the U.S. Banana Company. In many respects it was a satellite, a satellite of the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they having human rights problems there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, they were, but people didn't talk very much about them in the
                    late '70s. By the time they started talking about them in the '80s, our policy
                    required Honduras to be in a partnership but there was very little talk about
                    them then. Now, there has been a lot of talk about what was going on in the
                    '90s, but there wasn't much talk about it then. Yes, there were abuses going on.
                    I guess in the '80s the most one heard about regularly were the police abuses,
                    but the army abuses were well known. But the overriding concern was keeping
                    Honduras as our ally in the Central American difficulties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of thing did the Contras play in the politics of
                        the Nicaraguan conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: They didn't really play in the politics. They played in the
                    US-Honduras relationship, because essentially we give the Hondurans billions of
                    dollars in aid, and in return Honduras let the Contras train and have camps on
                    their soil from which they could go back into Nicaragua. But there wasn't that
                    much discussion in the press publicly except on a couple of occasions. The
                    border roads would be mined, and every now and again somebody would get blown up
                    and, of course, that would be reported in the press, but it was accepted. In
                    many of those societies the people that were being blown up were the peasants,
                    and the line between sort of the peasant level and the folks that controlled the
                    press, controlled the economy, controlled politics was really insurmountable.
                    So, yes, it was reported, but it wasn't the better off, the better connected,
                    the better educated that were getting blown up. They weren't out in the country
                    on these border roads. So it was reported sort of matter of fact, never a big
                    here and cry about it. There were a couple of instances which did provide a lot
                    of attention, ongoing attention. One was when a couple of American journalists
                    got blown up in one of these border wars. One of them was a reporter for the
                    L.A. Times. That was in '83, if I remember correctly. And, of course, that got
                    picked up on in a big way by the US press, and the story lived on and on, opened
                    the door to just what were these reporters doing there and what was the United
                    States interest and so on. And another time, which was perhaps that same year or
                    the next year - I can't remember - an American priest, and American Jesuit,
                    accompanied a column of Nicaraguan guerillas across the jungle mountains into
                    Honduras and disappeared, died. Then there was a lot of attention, which goes on
                    even today, about what happened to this American Jesuit. I think that incident -
                    that was probably '83/'84 - was the first opening of the door to examining
                    Honduras' human rights record stemming from the involvement of America.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, not my sights. [Inaudible.] I just never had anything to do with

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh yes, everybody knew. I guess not everybody knew, but everybody
                    knew something was going on. They often say that the happiest posts are the
                    posts where there's pressure, and certainly people were very happy. People
                    thought they had a mission, and looking back, it was very satisfying. What did
                    Reagan care about? He cared about Nicaragua and he cared about Afghanistan. So
                    if you wanted to be where there's action in the foreign policy sense, Honduras
                    was one of the few places under Reagan where you certainly knew you were getting
                    attention. In that sense I think it was very satisfying. It was interesting to
                    watch the growth of the embassy over that period of time, because between, say,
                    '82 and '85 the place tripled in size. Whereas in the early days it was a
                    smaller post and everyone knew each other, now there were all kinds of strange
                    characters walking around towards the end of that period. People had funny
                    stories to tell about camping out on hillsides with night-vision goggles
                    watching this, that and the other things. You'd meet them at parties and it
                    would be the only time you'd ever see them. It was interesting in that
                    sense.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, Briggs was there - no, not Briggs; what was his name? John
                    Negroponte was there for most of my tour, but who was there when I first arrived
                    in '81? I don't remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: And then Negroponte, exactly. John stayed, I guess, for about six
                    months. Then John Negroponte was as prize given the fact that it was such a
                    pivotal place in terms of the Reagan policy, he was a very strong person, John
                    Negroponte. It became clear he knew exactly what he thought should be done to
                    advance the policy</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, one saw that in the number of visitors that came through the
                    embassy. Very few of them ever wanted to talk to the consular section. But my
                    husband was in the political section and my closest friends were in USIA (United
                    States Information Agency) and they would all be involved in these endless
                    visits, hundreds of people every month, not just CODELs but private people to
                    whom courtesies needed to be extended because of their interest, members of the
                    press calling in for interviews, wanting to know what was going on. I wasn't
                    directly involved in this sort of stuff. They weren't interested in consular
                    stuff.</p>

                    week taking care of these visitors and then they'd have their regular work to do
                    on top of that. It was really six- and seven-day weeks for most of these people
                    and very tiring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a husband. I don't know if we ever discussed
                        when you got married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, we got married after that tour in Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you met your husband there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, I met him there on that tour, exactly. The people that were
                    involved in the Central American issues were working day and night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did visas raise their head there? Was this a problem or it
                        was fairly routine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: We always had the problem of refusing, that usual sort of problem,
                    but that was manageable. And, as I said, we did have the interesting aspects to
                    that work that one didn't encounter elsewhere in terms of the Contras coming in
                    and talking to them about things other than visas, if you will. And also, as
                    things got more involved, it was interesting when high-ranking government or
                    military officials would come in and figuring out what was it they were really
                    going to be doing in the United States; those things and then the dead Americans
                    who got blown up or disappeared from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you send out search parties looking for the
                        Jesuit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, we didn't send out search parties because it truly was
                    tropical canopy jungle. I remember going out several times with the family by
                    helicopter, by military helicopter, going up and down these ravines. But those
                    things don't last. When there's that kind of jungle, the decay rate was fairly
                    rapid. And there aren't paths. Where do you go?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feel about what had happened? You mentioned
                        Nicaraguan guerillas. Whose guerillas were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I don't know if they were manipulated or organized by a higher
                    party, but they were about, oh, 80 to 100 of them and they were coming over to
                    Honduras to engage in terrorist acts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were essentially from the Sandinista side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The lower ranks of the Catholic Church were pretty much in
                        bed with the Sandinistas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, exactly. And the southern part of Honduras had a number of
                    churches and priests that sort of espoused the more radical liberation theology.
                    And these guys were coming across. The priest in question had in fact worked in
                    Honduras earlier down in the south. So he came with them, and most of the rest
                    of the column were 16-, 17-, 18-year-olds. This guy was in his late 60s, so just
                    from a physical standpoint it's not surprising to think that he might have
                    perished. Of course, the family and other extremists in the United States
                    insisted that the Honduran army had captured and tortured him to death, and
                    that's why they didn't come up with the body. Who knows? Perhaps they did. I
                    don't think so, but it's possible. His vestments were recovered and his Bible
                    and what have you, but his body wasn't. But a lot of men and women - there were
                    women there, too - who were considerably younger and, according to other
                    eye-witness reports, in considerably better shape than this priest died. There
                    was nothing to eat in those jungles either. There's no game to catch or fruit or
                    anything like that apparently. They described the most awful conditions. So I
                    don't know what actually happened to him. His family wrote a book in which they
                    speak really castigatingly, if you will, towards our efforts. But what can you
                    do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the embassy, the officers of the embassy, was there
                        any dissention in private or something that maybe we shouldn't be doing this
                        or we should be nicer to the Sandinistas or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I never picked that up at all. I think most people in the embassy
                    thought the Sandinistas were pretty awful people. The people that I know from
                    that period in Honduras that I've seen since certainly haven't changed their
                    minds. No, I didn't detect that. It was interesting at that time, and later in
                    the '80s too, how few FSOs go to Central America, and you hear about people not
                    wanting to go because they didn't agree with the policy. I don't know if the
                    people that were there when I was there, I don't know how many of them agreed
                    with the policy strongly or not strongly, but I think there was overwhelmingly
                    the sense that, hey, we're where the action is and that's what we're in this
                    business for. So clearly whatever, if you want to call it, morality or right and
                    wrong about the situation, you might have thought about was not that strong to
                    take over a feeling of being at the center of what the United States is all
                    about in the foreign policy sense at that time. I never heard anybody say that.
                    But it was interesting to think of how many people's careers got ruined by
                    Central America, and there was a fair number, and I think that was because of
                    politics in the Department and politics on the Hill and how many people wouldn't
                    come, how often those jobs were going vacant because nobody would bid on
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a matter of conviction or just 'this is a hot
                        potato' and because of the Congressional pressure and some of the true
                        believers in the State Department...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I don't know, but either way, any way you cut it, doesn't speak very
                    well to the Foreign Service. At a subsequent time I was desk officer for
                    Ireland. In fact, when I came back in '84 I remember just being appalled at how
                    many people bid on DCM Dublin. There'd be 120 or 130 people, and at the same
                    time you couldn't get anybody to go to Central America, but you had a lot of
                    people joining the Foreign Service. It's all very well that we all like a nice
                    post every now and again, but to me...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like retirement place. There's nothing happening
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Nothing happening there a perfectly pleasant but one doesn't need
                    the Foreign Service to go and have a perfectly good life in Ireland, because
                    whereas being involved in real policy issues, you can only do that in Honduras.
                    But it's just an interesting thought. I don't know if that's the case today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's hard to say, but I think the Service keeps changing
                        all the time, and there's a tendency to try to get a job that looks good on
                        paper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: A lot of people in Central America, as I said earlier, did not get
                    supported by the system thereafter, did not get promoted, did not have a system
                    in their embassies and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I think in the end, like everything else, it's a combination
                    of factors, but if the system wants people to go and take the tough jobs, there
                    should be ways to make sure that there is some reward other than...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was certainly a system that dealt with it fairly
                        well in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: There may be. I wish I had gone to Vietnam, but I didn't, so I don't
                    know that much about it. But people not getting promoted, that's probably a
                    combination of poorly written OERs, which can do it for you anytime, maybe broad
                    antipathy toward Central America. I don't know. But people not getting
                    embassies, having their names withdrawn because of strong Congressional feelings
                    for the other side that's something that perhaps not at the very time but later
                    on, could have been corrected. There are guys down there just now getting their
                    first embassies that were in ARA at the time in the mid-'80s, and here we are
                    year 2000 and they're just getting their embassies. That's absurd, 16 years.
                    Some people did go on, but there are enough who did not that it makes you wonder
                    whether when one perhaps says as a continuing effort, someone might look and
                    say, “What happened to the people that did the tough job in the '80s? Did they
                    get rewards?” In the future that might well argue to people not to take the
                    tough jobs, because they see what happened the last time there was a very
                    strongly felt issue in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had people in Congress who felt very strongly either
                        on the right or on the left. I think Congress, when Reagan came in, set the
                        stage by treating people particularly in Latin America as being, because
                        they had been assigned there during the Carter time, as being sort of Carter
                        loyals, which was not the case at all. And I think there was a sort of
                        backlash after that of those in Congress who had power saying, “If you're
                        going to do that to our guys, we'll do this to your guys.” Of course, people
                        get caught in the middle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's right. Taking that approach with political appointees, I
                    suppose, is a fair game, but taking it with career FSOs goes against the grain
                    and certainly in my mind would encourage FSOs to take positions only in such
                    instances where they believed in the cause, which I think for the long term is
                    not healthy for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not at all.</hi>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I think of Joe Sullivan, who was assigned to Central America in the
                    early '80s, got some place in Africa - I guess he's still there; he got it less
                    than three years ago. I don't know where he is, but anyway he just got it a
                    couple years ago. Mike Kozak, who just came out of Cuba - I don't know what's
                    happening. They sent him to Cuba because they knew they couldn't get him
                    confirmed. I don't know whether they're going to try to give him an embassy
                    somewhere or not. Now, of course, being principal officer in Cuba is not a small
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yesterday I was interviewing Jay Taylor, who was there
                        with Kozak as his deputy, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Did he mention where Mike is, by the way?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, he didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: The reason Mike went there was because they couldn't get him
                    confirmed anywhere else, and I think he's still in the Department, so maybe
                    there's a chance he will get an embassy. For people to whom having the title of
                    ambassador is important, then you don't get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '84 you went back to Washington as Irish Desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, I went back to EUR. Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Iceland were
                    my domain.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: '86, two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that? I would think with the Irish one
                        you would get caught up in Boston politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, you did, very much, very much, Boston politics and the White
                    House. State Department didn't run anything, as far as I could make out, on
                    Northern Ireland, which is all that Ireland's about, Ireland and Northern
                    Ireland, and it was all done from the White House. It was all domestic politics,
                    generally Boston, who ran it. Nonetheless, it was an interesting experience. The
                    Irish ambassador would always call up the White House, wouldn't have anything to
                    do with us. But it was interesting to have that insight into American politics.
                    Margaret Heckler was the ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: A most unpleasant lady, most unpleasant, very much prima donna
                    without too much of the social graces. Barbara Watson may have been a prima
                    donna and probably was a prima donna but she at least had social graces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a lady.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: She was a lady, exactly. I don't know. Margaret Heckler and I have
                    never quite saw eye to eye on pretty much everything, so the care and feeding of
                    her was difficult. I was glad not to be a DCM, however. The thing I found
                    interesting was I just could not believe that these people were really fighting,
                    they had been fighting for over 1,000 years. I remember just being aghast when I
                    went to Belfast one time and a principal officer had a lunch for me and there
                    were the two sides present, and they started arguing about it over lunch: “When
                    you all did this back in 1492,” or whatever it was and blah-blah-blah. I have
                    never been involved in the Arab-Israeli thing, which must be fairly similar, but
                    I was just amazed that people would be thinking back that many hundreds of
                    years. For me, seeing all the signs of militarization and such was not a big
                    deal having come out of Central America, seeing machine guns and camouflage and
                    barriers on the road, but I remember being impressed when I was taking a train
                    up to Belfast from Dublin and they had blown up the line. We had to get off and
                    get bussed out, and everybody on the bus was oohing and aahing as we passed the
                    guns and the camouflage guys and the tanks and whatever. “What is their problem?
                    This is normal.” For them it was all normal. That was an interesting and
                    sobering experience to see what had become normal for me after those three years
                    in Central America, and it was just a way of life to see machine guns
                    around.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's what we thought anyway. They were disputed, going to mothers
                    and children working and things like that, but that's what we thought. In that
                    period of time it had a lot of bounce and had a lot of involvement by Americans

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, but there are an awful lot of younger illegal Irish immigrants
                    in the Boston area who, depending on what persuasion, would be feeding those
                    fires. That was the other revelation to me. Of course, one could come up with
                    the statistics and figure it out, but the idea that Ireland was really just like
                    Central America in terms of being a poor country of Europe and having a
                    per-capita income so far below the rest of Europe that it's major export was
                    still people in the 1970s/1980s was again a real eye opener. You can read about
                    these things, but to me it's the first-hand experience that makes them come
                    alive, and that was just astounding to learn how people lived, the poverty level
                    of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland when they're in fact part of Northern
                    Europe. I had never really focused on the fact before that there were all these
                    illegal immigrants from Ireland just as there were from anyplace south of the

                    the country but certainly in the Massachusetts area they were welcomed. They
                    weren't treated the way others were.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: He was one of the good guys, as was the former Speaker of the House,
                    O'Neill, Tip O'Neill. They used to call them the four horsemen, Kennedy,
                    O'Neill, Moynihan - I can't remember who the fourth was - who were reasonable,
                    reasonable people, obviously pro-Catholic but reasonable, not radical. They led
                    any number of ventures in the Congress to try to provide assistance. I must say
                    one of them I thought was a bit egregious and where they set up an assistance
                    fund out of the AID budget, which I think persists today. It was supposed to be
                    an inducement for peace, but it obviously never had that effect.</p>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It certainly wasn't anywhere close to that in terms of the amount of
                    money and it wasn't quite that obvious. The idea was, if I remember correctly,
                    it was going to be set up.... The fund was to create jobs, the theory being
                    that, if you got more Catholics in jobs, that would dissipate a lot of the
                    tension, because the unemployment rate for Catholics was extraordinarily higher
                    than it was for young Protestants, and so the idea was to create industry in
                    Northern Ireland, which was not actually exclusive. Their primary focus was on
                    the Catholics and you would lower the tensions and things would dissipate. But
                    the fact is nobody wanted to build a business in Northern Ireland with the risk
                    of being bombed being too great. I'm not sure if it originated in the Congress
                    or if it originated in State, the idea of taking the Sullivan principles that
                    were applied against South Africa or against businesses in South Africa, and
                    applying them into Northern Ireland, and that has limited success.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: But it's still very much a looking-backwards kind of church as is,
                    or at least was, the Italian Catholic Church at the time, and very conservative.
                    They're both very conservative. I would say actually that the Irish Church was
                    more conservative than the Italian Catholic Church. I guess it's something about
                    proximity to the Vatican that makes you more liberal. “They're right there;
                    they'll save us in the end.” But the hand of the Catholic Church in Ireland is
                    something that you didn't see in Italy, and certainly in Italy it would exist at
                    the village level, the power of the priests, but in Ireland it went up much
                    higher in society and wasn't confined to the village.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I didn't see any of that, but maybe they didn't have to when then
                    had Moynihan, O'Neill, and Kennedy, and Reagan in the White House. They didn't
                    have to worry.</p>
                <p>There was always a lot of explaining, there was a lot of correspondence
                    explaining to people just what it was we were doing or not doing or what was
                    really going on over there or not. And then we can't forget that, you know,
                    there was also Iceland in my portfolio, and we had a number of issues with
                    Iceland, first of all the base and probably even more important at that time was
                    a huge shipping dispute. Iceland, perhaps still today - I don't know -
                    controlled all the shipping in and out of the country. I can't remember the
                    details of this case, but it was Rainbow Navigation. It was this little upstart
                    company, US company, called Rainbow, and Rainbow somehow found some loophole in
                    the Icelandic law and started shipping to Iceland at much reduced rates. I can't
                    remember the details now, but it rapidly became a major issue to the point where
                    it was, in their case, at the prime minister level and went on easily for a year
                    or year and a half. It pitted the unions on this side and so on, and that
                    consumed a lot of time because it also had ramifications for the base and all
                    the surveillance that we were doing on that base. So that took up a lot of time.
                    So the days were not quiet by any means.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, we didn't give them. Every year around St. Patrick's Day there
                    would be some that would come up as an issue and people would test the waters
                    and such, but they weren't that big a deal. I'm trying to remember. There's
                    something you said that reminded me. Well, I can't remember. Have to think about

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, and now I remember what I was going to say. We also had a fair
                    number of people - and it would come up in the visa process - who would say that
                    they had renounced their IRA connections, and those were very interesting. If I
                    remember correctly, the policy or rule was that they had to have done equally as
                    much against as they had done for, something to that effect. I always found that
                    kind of interesting, looking at that - what had they done before, and what did
                    the Agency think they'd done before versus what had been done after? But those
                    were the more interesting of visa questions.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I would say no, but by and large they didn't need to be as nasty as
                    the IRA because, of course, they had the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which could
                    be very nasty in its own right. Now, it did so with the force of law. And they
                    didn't have financial support from within the United States, and I suppose they
                    didn't bomb people and what have you, but they could be fairly nasty. I think
                    the volume of the kind of IRA activity on the Protestant side was less.
                    Certainly there was terrorist activity going on, but they didn't have much
                    reason to come over here anyway, so we didn't hear about them in terms of visas.
                    They certainly weren't getting much support out of the United States.</p>

                    they were on my watch. I don't have any recollection of having to deal with
                    them. I'm probably thinking about that movie. You know, there was a movie a few
                    years back about an IRA guy that comes to America and gets blown up or
                    something. By mistake he is killed.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Not while I was involved. They were still very proud of their

                    close to the United States, but that was more in an economic and cultural sense
                    than a political/military kind of approach. When they would rattle our cage
                    about the base, it was generally on cultural or economic basis, if you will.</p>

                    of, this worldwide American culture. So they'd rattle our cage about the base,

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, they were all pretty objective so there wasn't much carping
                    about what the other was reporting. There was obviously a different slant, but
                    it seemed to be pretty objective. The Consul General in Belfast at the time was
                    a guy called Sam Bartlett, and Sam was having a great time. He really loved the
                    place and seemed to be loved by all. But in my conversations with him he could
                    see things fairly objectively. Now, the guy in London was a fellow called Peter
                    Reams, and he was fairly happy-go-lucky. He's still in the Department. I think
                    he's going to retire in a couple years. I saw him the other day.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, and his father was an FSO, too. In fact, Peter and I talked. We
                    were both on the selection boards last year, and we talked about it. I hadn't

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I'm sure Peter will be interested in this sort of stuff,
                    because he told me that, if I remember correctly, he had done a lot of work with
                    his father, but maybe it was with both of his parents, in terms of recollections
                    about the Service. In fact, he told me how to get my dad's records if I wanted
                    them. Anyway, Peter was in London at the time. Peter's not one to get involved
                    emotionally or what have you, so I don't think he lost his objectivity about the
                    whole thing. And, of course, Dublin's hopeless because Dublin's always

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, right. I never paid that much attention because you knew what
                    was going to come out of them anyway, but you could count on Sam and you could
                    count on London not changing what Sam had to say, and you could count on Peter
                    because both of them are level-headed, objective people. And our office director
                    was another very level-headed person, Martin Wyneck. I don't know if you've
                    talked to him. Marty's very level headed. So I think we were getting the
                    straight scoop, not that we could necessarily react properly because of the
                    politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On some of these cases, something that matters dealing
                        with Israel, you have sort of within the political process sort of true
                        believers in the Israeli cause, usually of Jewish extraction, in Congress as
                        staff aides and all. Did you have any true believers of the Irish cause that
                        caused problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No. I mean there were, like the Congressman from New York who got
                    defeated last fall. What is his name? De Mata. De Mata must have a lot of Irish
                    people. He was always fairly vocal. And there were one or two others, but they
                    were minor players when you consider Moynihan, Kennedy and the speaker. They
                    controlled everything. Without them things didn't move up there, so there wasn't
                    much in it for anybody else.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No. St. Patrick's Day and then the end of July or August, right
                    about now, is the marching season in Northern Ireland, and you just knew people
                    were going to blow up bombs and have counter-demonstrations that turn violent
                    and what have you, but that was not generated in this country.</p>

                <p>This is August 11, 2000. You were saying that after you left Ireland you went to
                    university training.</p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I went to university training at American University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of training was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was primarily in computers and telecommunications. Remember this
                    was 1986, and at least in my exposure to the Department, we were and probably
                    still are way behind the curve in terms of modern technology and communications
                    and such. I thought that it would be a good thing to learn more than what the
                    Department was offering at that time and that it might be particularly useful to
                    get into that field and apply it more in Consular Affairs because automation was
                    certainly the way of the future in Consular Affairs. So I applied for university
                    training to study, as I said, communications and computers and
                    telecommunications. And so I went off for nine months to American University and
                    had an enjoyable time. Intellectually in terms of subject matter, it was very
                    interesting to be once again in school, which was never one of my favorite
                    places to be, but this time with people that were 20/25 years younger than I
                    was, that was kind of interesting. I felt sort of like an interloper taking
                    beginning computer courses and this sort of thing. I guess what strikes me most
                    about that year was how little success I had towards the end of it in finding a
                    job in the Department where I could utilize those skills, because in terms of
                    being in the computer systems field in State and working it from that angle, the
                    idea was that I wasn't enough of a specialist. I was too high ranking to kind of
                    move into that. I can't remember what I was at that point, a two or maybe I had
                    gotten to a one, I don't know. So I ended up going to the Executive Office of
                    CA, and one of my portfolios there was in fact working with their automation
                    staff. They were the one place in the Department that I was aware of that was
                    fairly advanced in terms of automation, so I wasn't in the Systems Office, sort
                    of the liaison between the Executive Office and the Systems Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from '87 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: What, in CA?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I only did that for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '87-'88. I wonder if you could explain the relationship
                        between the Systems Office, which was the State Department's main computer
                        office at that time, and Consular Affairs. I'll put it in perspective. Back
                        in '78 or '79 I was in Seoul, and with the help of our DCM Tom Stern, we
                        were trying to put in a computerized system in Consular Affairs, actually
                        for the embassy, and the central office sent somebody out to help us do it,
                        Turk Lewis, and apparently they weren't talking to Consular Affairs. We were
                        reporting back what we were doing, but it seems like Consular Affairs was
                        going its way and Systems was going its way. But now we're talking about 10
                        years later. How were relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Relations at that point were certainly a lot better than what you've
                    just described. There's always a sort of impasse between the two offices,
                    because so few people in the main part of the Bureau knew anything about
                    automation or computers. Yet there were those that saw the potential in terms of
                    reducing the complaints about poor service, reducing the continued skyrocketing
                    need for officers to manage workloads and such. Ron Somerville, I thought, was
                    very influential in a positive way in bringing the two together. He was on very
                    good terms with the Systems Office management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Executive Director...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: He was Executive Director for what must have been 15 years for
                    Consular Affairs, and the period that I was there fell within his tenure. I
                    think I was there '87/'88, and I think he was hired about 1990 or thereabouts, a
                    number of years after that. But he clearly saw the potential. Given his ability
                    to know where all the bodies were buried and his ability to secure funds, the
                    automation program was decently funded, considering the context of the poor
                    funding overall for the State Department and the lack of very active interest in
                    automation for other State Department functions. At that time the Consular
                    Affairs Bureau had a rather unique relationship on the Hill and was very
                    successful in its lobbying effort, if you will, to point out the potential that
                    would directly affect members of Congress' constituencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Systems Bureau and the Consular
                        Bureau worked together pretty well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Certain offices in the Consular Affairs Bureau, primarily the Visa
                    Office. That was where the initial focus was for many years. I think it's only
                    more recently that the passport operation has gotten more automated, and I
                    frankly don't even know what's happened with American Citizen Services in that
                    regard. I cheer leaded the movement and the positive relationship to Ron for the
                    sake of the Bureau. He really believed in it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '87 to '88 period, who was Assistant Secretary
                        for Consular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Joan Clark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joan Clark, how did she fit into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: She certainly didn't oppose it in any way, because Joan Clark is a
                    very talented person and is known, and I've seen her put her foot down when she
                    wanted to oppose things. But I don't have any recollection of her being actually
                    involved in a big way in this sort of operation.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the reception of computerization within
                        the Visa Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Most people didn't seem to care. It seems to me that most people did
                    really appreciate the benefits that it could bring. The only part of VO that was
                    automated at that point, if I remember correctly, was the numbers game, the
                    immigrant visa numbers and such. But that was fairly small potatoes in terms of
                    the potential. I think the development of the systems was just too nascent for
                    most people to kind of pull their heads back and get a bit of perspective from
                    the demands of daily work. Most of the work that was being done by the Systems
                    Office, if I remember correctly, at that time was development work as opposed to
                    helping posts and solving and such, so it was a little early in the process for
                    people actually to see in any big way how all these things were really going to
                    make them able to do their job more efficiently and such.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '87 whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I went to the Inspector's Office for a year. For reasons that we
                    needn't go into now, I curtailed and the summer was already upon us and, as we
                    all know, there weren't very many jobs at that point in the assignment cycle. So
                    I went to the Inspector's Office and I was an inspector for a year. From there I
                    went to the Philippines. I enjoyed that, probably in great measure knowing that
                    it was just for year. I think it's very difficult for the Inspector's Office to
                    get people to take a two-year assignment, much less these poor civil servants.
                    Now I think at least a third, if not more, of the staff is civil servants. But
                    the idea of maintaining that kind of a travel schedule on an indefinite basis is
                    just not conducive to getting the best and the brightest civil servants and
                    retaining them, because it's hell on personal life, family life and such. But
                    for me for one year it was very enjoyable and very educational, and I realized
                    that one really had to limit one's expectations of what the inspection process
                    was all about in State and that the main objective really had to be helping
                    people rather than inspecting. One of the inspections that we did was Taiwan and
                    Korea. I was doing the consular work, and the consular section in Korea was
                    quite messed up, and it came up with a number of recommendations which we
                    thought went to the heart of the problem. But the post fought mightily and
                    ultimately won. There it was sort of management shortcomings that then persisted
                    for another three or four years, at least one more consul general, and then I
                    think maybe it that was that. In Taiwan it wasn't so much management problems as
                    sort of policy issues involving money because of the special relationship
                    between the United States and Taiwan and the peculiarities of some of the
                    consular operations there. It sort of struck me that in the inspection process
                    when you have an ambassador going out against the Inspector General, it's very
                    hard to effect any meaningful change, and the only way one can do it, I think,
                    was if the people at post wanted to be helped and one could project oneself in
                    the position of being a helper rather than being the inspector. That whole
                    experience was interesting. As I said, we did Korea and Taiwan on one trip,
                    Mexico on another...</p>

                        consular establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: We were in Mexico for three months, and we had, I think, six
                    consular inspectors - maybe it was three. We divided into three teams for the
                    subordinate consulates, and each had one consular person and then somebody of
                    some other description. There were significant problems at one small post that I
                    went to. Overall it was a pretty good operation in Mexico. Then we inspected SP
                    that year, which I was thrilled about because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SP being...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: The Policy Planning Staff - because it required learning about the
                    different functions that office had had under different Secretaries of State,
                    and it was obvious as one looked at the history of this. At the time we were
                    inspecting SP wasn't particularly doing very much as an office. There were
                    individuals who, because of their background or relationship with Department
                    principals, were very, very heavily involved in key policy issues, but as an
                    office it really wasn't doing very much. So we looked at how in fact the
                    vitality, the relevance, of that office really depended upon the relationship of
                    the head of the office with the Secretary of State. Of course, the time when it
                    was at its best was with George Kennan because of the relationship there. That
                    was fascinating from that perspective. Then the final inspection we did that
                    year was the Economic Bureau. I was with the group that handled aviation and
                    transportation issues, and not being a very strong economic officer, those were
                    the least kind of economic sort of issues. I can't remember anything terribly
                    remarkable about that. But the way it worked, as you know, you go out on these
                    60-day trips and then you're back here for 30 days writing up the report and
                    briefing or debriefing, and then part of that time you're sort of briefing up
                    for the next trip and then off again for 60 days. It's a very disjointed kind

                        involved, in essentially personnel problems and personal problems? I'm
                        thinking of alcoholism, sexual harassment, personality conflicts, that type

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: They were often contributors to the overall, say, poor management
                    situation. I never found they were sort of the key issue. If they were present,
                    they were present as an adjunct to broader difficulties. I don't recall any
                    sexual harassment issues. There were a lot of morale problems; a lot of problems
                    stemming from lack of communication and mutual understanding between the
                    consular section and the rest of the embassy, generally over the question of the
                    amount of immigrant visas, which is fairly standard; a lot of mismanagement, I
                    would say, or poor management or inadequate management in terms of money and use
                    of resources and that sort of thing; but some first-class operations too. I
                    remember going to Aramosea - I can't remember who was principal officer; Bob
                    Kennedy, as a matter of fact - an absolutely first-class operation even though
                    they had much of their consular resource space diverted to narcotics control,
                    narcotics reporting and that sort of thing, but absolutely a first-class
                    operation. I'm trying to think of who the Kennedy was. He's still in the
                    Department.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, a fellow that looks a bit like you.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Sherman Funk, yes, and this was shortly after that new legislation
                    having Inspector Generals report to the White House, the President, rather than
                    to the head of their agency. So the office was much strengthened, figuratively
                    anyway. I didn't frankly see that it changed much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the feelings at the time when this new inspection
                        process came in was that this was more a prosecutorial situation.
                        Particularly they tripled the number of accountants and all of that. As a
                        practical measure it all struck me that the State Department doesn't handle
                        that much in the way of funds. Financial mismanagement is not the major.
                        Financial mismanagement can be in the billions if you're talking about the
                        Bureau of Land Management, but in the State Department it's how you do your
                        job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, there were a number of things that emanated from that
                    legislation, and it came from where Sherman Funk came from. I'm not sure but
                    whether he was the first outsider to be Inspector General and then came in with
                    this sort of mantle of authority and came from a background such as you've just
                    described. I think there was an effort, or through various actions there
                    certainly was a feeling that that's what the office was more about than it had
                    been in the past. That's also the time, as you pointed out, that they started
                    bringing a lot of civil service people in, primarily accountants and auditors,
                    who had been in other agencies doing financial audits. One of the things that we
                    would have endless arguments about was, first of all, what was the difference
                    between an audit and an inspection and, secondly, whether one could apply the
                    approaches used by financial auditors to what in the Department we call
                    substantive work like political and economic reporting. Many of them had this
                    idea that you could set up a grid and via this grid you could evaluate the
                    effectiveness of, say, a political section, how many contacts, how many phone
                    calls, how many lunches, how many cocktail parties, how many cables sent. I
                    thought it was a bit bizarre, but certainly at that point I hadn't worked
                    overseas as a political or economic officer so I sort of deferred to those that
                    had, and they were just absolutely rabid about the idea that this was a way to
                    measure the effectiveness of a political section. They also applied, or tried to
                    apply, the audit approach to consular work, because while there was limited
                    scope for that in terms of money - it's fairly straightforward as to whether you
                    handle your receipts properly - they thought that was a whole question of
                    numbers. Since Consular Affairs had made its mark in terms of securing
                    resources, because it could quantify the work more than anyplace else in the
                    Department - how many visa applications, how many issued, how many denied, how
                    many requests for passports, how many citizenship cases, how many deaths, or
                    whatever - they had used that as the basis to secure these additional resources
                    on the Hill. And since essentially at that point one was talking about numbers,
                    the financial auditors, who looked at numbers from a different perspective, were
                    particularly inclined to used their auditing skills on consular work, with mixed
                    results but certainly better results overall than trying to apply it to
                    political or economic...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This matrix idea has been tried again and again and again
                        to measure the effectiveness for political and economic reporting. It never

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It would be nice. It's nice to think that it would be easy and so
                    therefore it's nice to think that one could do it that way, but I never quite
                    grasped that concept how this is all going to fit together. But then again, I'm
                    not sure if it was at that time that they separated the Inspector's Office into
                    inspections, audits, and whatever it was for prosecutions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It might have been the same period. And, of course, the people doing
                    prosecutions had to find people to prosecute, whereas before it had only been
                    sort of if it was egregious. Then they would persuade the US Attorney's Office
                    to do something, but now there was an entire office so I think they were sort of
                    looking at things that were bad nonetheless - don't get me wrong - but they
                    weren't as egregious as the cases that had been prosecuted in prior years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did seem from what I was hearing that they were looking
                        for things where normally you'd say, “Cut it out, George, and pay up,” or
                        “You owe some money here and you shouldn't have done it,” and “Pay for that
                        trip or that set of things,” and say, “Don't do it again. Sin no more.”
                        Now...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, we had shifted our crunch. It wasn't a pleasant job in that
                    one's relations with colleagues in the Department were not as kind of loose and
                    friendly as they are in other jobs, in part because of this changing attitude
                    and the lack of understanding or comprehension about folks outside the Inspector
                    General's Office as to where it was really going. So there was a certain amount
                    of tension because it was shifting direction. But I found it educational. I
                    don't suppose they say that about every experience. Anyway, that was a one-year
                    assignment, and at the end of it my husband and I were trying to get a tandem
                    assignment overseas, which gets to the whole question of couples, both members
                    of a marriage, if you will, working in the State Department and that difficulty.
                    But we did eventually. I got an assignment to Manila, and our understanding,
                    which turned out to be wrong or changed or what have you, was that a year later
                    he would probably get an assignment there as the political military officer. It
                    didn't work out, but that's what we were aiming for. So after a year in the
                    Inspector's Office, I...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right. Well, at that time it was the highest in the world. It's now
                    been surpassed, I think, by the combined Mexico operations, but it was providing
                    $7,000,000 or $8,000,000 a year in fees by itself. It was a pretty depressing
                    operation. There were about 10 junior officers in the immigrant visa section or
                    branch or whatever it was called. They only stayed about three or four months,
                    and then they rotated to other parts of the consular section. So from a
                    management perspective, it was a never-ending process of starting from zero and
                    working up. They were a fine bunch of officers that came through, very
                    impressive, the junior officers coming in, but it was hard to keep them
                    motivated and it was hard to keep myself motivated with this unending stream of
                    people that knew nothing about immigration law or the State Department and
                    really didn't care because they had their eyes fixed on their next, whatever,
                    substantive work or something less of a dronish kind of existence. That was a
                    difficult time between the United States and the Soviets. Of course, Marcos was
                    gone, but there was a lot of anti-American feeling and there were several coup
                    attempts during the year. Every month something would happen. There was either a
                    coup or a typhoon or flood or earthquake or volcano exploding. It seemed like
                    every month with some regularity there was some major issue, which was
                    interesting in itself, of course, but, speaking as the manager of this large
                    operation, made it that much more difficult to keep up. I remember one of the
                    constant refrains of Washington was, “You've got to use those numbers. You've
                    got to use those numbers. How come you can't use those numbers?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were numbers allocated to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Number for immigration to the United States. Of course, every time
                    we had one of these events and shut down for a week, it made the process of
                    churning these out with these young folks, who were willing but not terribly
                    able given their status at a new post, that much more difficult. The other thing
                    I found interesting, before we move on to other things, as the manager of that
                    operation was just how many links there are between the Filipino community in
                    the Philippines and folks back here. I have never in my whole life seen as many
                    unification cases. I would have 20 or 30 a day coming in.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, but there is, and there are a number of restaurants, not that I
                    frequent them. Filipino food is not amongst my choices, but there are, and most
                    of the Filipino community here in Washington, I don't think they live as a
                    community. You have the Latinos or you have Salvadorans, Honduran, what have
                    you, on Kalorama Road, Adams Morgan; out here in Arlington we have Vietnamese
                    now. I don't think the Filipinos live as a community the way other immigrant
                    groups in the Washington DC area do, but they are here in sufficient numbers to
                    justify or support these various Filipino restaurants that we know of here,
                    particularly in Virginia.</p>

                        knows about the problem of people trying to circumvent it, but what about

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Documentary problems. You could not trust any document in the
                    Philippines at all. They're great forgers; they were really very good. It
                    happened in so many of these operations where you have fraud. It really extends
                    from a cultural difference or a different cultural perspective than the
                    prevailing United States cultural perspective. Nothing really wrong started it,
                    there's nothing wrong with using whatever means available to one to get into the
                    United States. So you couldn't trust the written document, and you really
                    couldn't trust the verbal document either, the oral document, so you just kind
                    of went on gut feeling or you threw up your hands. If it didn't look that bad,
                    you went ahead. It did raise, particularly on the non-immigrant visa side, the
                    whole question of just how you justify your decision when you're doing it
                    basically on a gut feeling as opposed to anything more tangible, anything you
                    could really point to judge your decision.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That whole incident that I'm thinking of happened before I was
                    there, just before this, so it was still fresh in people's minds.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Probably more than once, probably twice that I can think of. It may
                    have happened more times, but I can think of two instances. But, you see, I
                    think that comes from one of the real dangers of consular work, which is to take
                    oneself too seriously and one's authority and such. I remember as a junior
                    officer it's very easy to let oneself think that all this attention is because
                    of oneself as opposed to one's position, and that's the difficulty, the danger,
                    for people new to the system. Now, one would think that somebody who'd been
                    around and reached a rank equivalent to consul general in a big place like
                    Manila would have acquired sufficient maturity to recognize that, but that is
                    the same sort of danger. Actually I think it's a bit of a danger with respect to
                    the Foreign Service too. I think a lot of people have difficulty when they
                    retire from the Foreign Service because of all this attention that they get,
                    especially if you're a consular officer, of course. Then it starts at the very
                    junior levels. But even in other fields, the United States is a big player most
                    places, and if you're representing the embassy, much less if you have visas to
                    dispose of, you are a big fish in a small pond. I think it makes for difficulty
                    when people retire, especially for a lot of people who've been ambassador. When
                    you go off and be an ambassador, maybe, and then after retirement nobody calls
                    and nobody's interested in you because you no longer have whatever it was people
                    thought you had before. The fact that they were interested in you is really
                    perhaps that they plus the sort of the cultural difference and what gets people
                    into trouble in our line of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Philippines, of course, is the preeminent case. I
                        was counselor general in Seoul about 10 years before this, and that problem
                        was there almost in the same magnitude. There was lots of fraud. I was
                        always worried about corruption.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Good thing to be worried about. You know, when you have such a
                    difference in the standard of living and at least in the case of the Philippines
                    you have a large community in the United States. So, you have enough contact
                    that you have people in the Philippines who have a fairly good idea of what it
                    is like here, what the opportunities are to work and that sort of thing. And so,
                    I suspect until recently there was less of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it, it was not with unhappiness that you decided to
                        curtail and go somewhere else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, no, no, no, not unhappiness about that at all. It was, in fact,
                    the worst post that I had, the worse assignment that I had, professionally as
                    well as personally. Manila was a dreadful place to live in those days, and
                    people that were there at the time that had been there in earlier years
                    certainly agreed with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I think it was this unrest, whether it came from acts of God or from
                    the government or acts of the revolutionaries. That was fairly constant, and it
                    was fairly clear that, if you keep the car out, you really kind of worry and you
                    just parked it wherever. You did worry about when you came back was there going
                    to be a bomb stuck under there. That was not an insignificant concern. Manila
                    also as a city, I find, is the most unattractive I've seen, unattractive. It's
                    all concrete. I guess it was just leveled in the war, so there's very little of
                    old historic value, and it has been built up and it's a great example of a
                    concrete jungle, and it's not attractive, whatever light color or different
                    color it's all sort of a gray concrete. Maybe that's the cheapest concrete; I
                    have no idea. There are no trees, no grass - in a couple residential, the
                    upper-class residential areas, yes, but I'm speaking of the city as a city more
                    than the residential areas. And air pollution was a big factor, noise pollution.
                    The bay was totally polluted. And it took hours; traffic was just incredible. I
                    lived about five miles from the embassy; if I left at seven, I could be there in
                    10 minutes. If I left at 7:15 or 7:20 it would take me an hour; to get out of
                    town it would take easily an hour and half of stop-and-go traffic. There were
                    dreadful fumes. It is just not a very livable city, and to get out of it was
                    very difficult. I spent a lot of time going up to Subic Bay and Clark Air Force
                    Base, couple of years before the base negotiations brought about their closure.
                    And that was heavenly. I can remember driving with my husband and we were going
                    to Subic Bay and we drove through the gates of Subic Bay and he said, “Listen.
                    The birds are singing in English.” “The birds, to begin with, the birds, and
                    they're singing! And there's grass and, look, there's a monkey over there.”
                    There's a great poverty, how this destroyed everything of beauty that Manila
                    might have had, with the war and then the poverty, that Manila might have had to
                    offer. Well, no, I was quite happy to leave.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I went back to Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in Honduras from 1990 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: ...to '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I had two jobs. The ambassador there at the time was a fellow,
                    Chris Arcos, who was a USIA officer, had been public affairs officer when we
                    were there the first time, and he had two senior jobs and could not fill them,
                    and that's how he got out of Manila. One of the jobs was political counselor,
                    and the other job was what they called regional affairs coordinator or such.
                    Honduras was the only place in Central America that had not or was not
                    experiencing civil waGuatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua- and so a lot of the
                    regional activities were based there. There were a lot of bilateral activities
                    based there, too. He wanted me to be political counselor and my husband to be
                    the regional affairs counselor because he, my husband, had worked with the
                    Contras for many years, both in Honduras before as well as in Washington, and it
                    made sense. Unfortunately the Department wouldn't let him do that because they
                    were afraid of being sued by my husband, who was political officer and therefore
                    rightly in their view should be the political counselor as opposed to me. But he
                    didn't want to be political counselor. The Department would not assign us to the
                    jobs we and the ambassador wanted to go to, so we went there assigned by the
                    Department as the Department saw fit and then the ambassador detailed us into
                    each other's jobs, and there is this obscure provision we found whereby an
                    ambassador can do that for up to a year. So at the end of the first year we went
                    on holiday and then he did it again, infuriating the Department but
                    accomplishing his purposes, with which we were quite comfortable anyway. So in
                    the beginning before we figured this out, I was the regional affairs person and
                    then we switched over when we figured out the loophole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about Honduras in '90 to '92. What was
                        the situation there government and American interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: They had their third or fourth elected president at that time. They
                    were sort of a shining star in terms of democracy, a peaceful-transition
                    democracy, and transition from one party to another and all that sort of thing.
                    In fact it was skin deep and isn't much better now, but of course one has to do
                    what the other countries would want it too. It was in fact much better. We had
                    poured a lot of money into Honduras during the '80s, and I don't know to what
                    extent that kept it stable, probably a fair amount, but Honduras doesn't have
                    the great divisions, great social and economic divisions, that most of the other
                    countries in Central America have. So, the really difficult part about Honduras
                    in '90 to '92 was that it was rapidly vanishing from the scope. The embassy was
                    drawing down. The money was dropping off. Peace was springing up in other
                    countries in Central America. So Honduras was losing its interest to the United
                    States, and I think for the ambassador that was a difficult process to manage
                    because it is fairly easy to grow but it's only a big person that can be honest
                    about cutting staff, resources and what have you when the political situation
                    had changed. So it was reverting to being a backwater that it has been for most
                    of its history. Most of the regional job had three aspects: one was the Contras,
                    one was narcotics, and the third was refugees. The first and third were wind-up
                    operations, and the narcotics was of course growing because Honduras hadn't had
                    the conflict and didn't have the organization of the other countries and was
                    missing the money that had been flowing in from the United States, was ripe for
                    traffickers to use and was a growing transit point for narcotics. It was very
                    different being there in those years than early in the '80s and kind of a
                    disappointment because, of course, in the early '80s one was at the center of
                    the foreign policy focus and certainly from '90 to '92 one wasn't. Honduras
                    doesn't have that much to offer in terms of places to visit, things to do. It
                    has always been sort of a backwater, backward water for the Spaniards, backwater
                    in the 9th century, backwater in the 20th century. So if you don't have a really
                    demanding job, it was sort of a challenge to find things to do to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work as a political officer? What did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: We focused on human rights at that point. People were very open,
                    very pro-American in Honduras, so there was absolutely no trouble finding people
                    to talk to. That was a period of time in which the Department was very
                    interested in Honduras. The military was, as we were, the Honduran military was
                    downsizing, was being forced to downsize, and this was really the one element of
                    potential instability. I mention it because the military was the source of most
                    of the human rights violations there, and the police was part of the military.
                    As the United States we were beginning to concentrate on human rights violations
                    in Honduras, but it was difficult because, I think - and there are different
                    points of view on this - my view is that they did exist in the '80s in a big
                    way, and because we had other priorities, we in fact didn't pay attention to
                    them, which happens a lot. What is the greater priority for the United States in
                    situation X, Y, Z? Human rights in the '80s were not going to be the biggest
                    priority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain in the Honduran context what were the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Disappearances, indefinite jail tenures, torture, forced
                    conscription; the military essentially was the law of the land. In many
                    developing countries, at least in Latin America, in the absence of a strong
                    civilian democratic government and not just presidency but regional
                    representation, legislature and such, once one gets out of the capital, the only
                    presence is the military - taking people's land, raping women so as to buy their
                    acquiescence, the military looking to agriculture, the military looking to
                    banking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Indians? One hears in Nicaragua of the Miskito
                        Indians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, there are in Honduras, too, on the Caribbean coast border
                    with Nicaragua, but in Honduras the population is much more mixed, it's a much
                    browner population overall than in Nicaragua, Salvador, or Guatemala. In those
                    countries where you had greater wealth you also have a much greater division
                    between the whites and the browns. In Honduras there was no money and very few
                    people other than of mixed race, I mean even in the Middle East Palestinians,
                    Christians, they all were white, white, white. Everybody there was sort of
                    different shades of brown. The military is an interesting institution because,
                    while people who are focused on Central America consider mainly its limitations
                    and shortcomings that we were talking about in terms of human rights, it also
                    was the one vehicle for social advancements and economic advancements for the
                    lower economic classes. Anybody could get into the military, and if you had the
                    smarts, that was the way, that was upward mobility. Business was not, government
                    was not. The military served an important function in that way. But Honduras
                    again, as I said, doesn't have Indian population that the other countries do,
                    but there are some, and the Garifunas in which are descendants of blacks from
                    the West Indies who live along the coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably came over from Belize.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: They didn't come from Belize; they came from St. Vincent and the
                    Grenadines, and they live on the coast and they speak their own language. Some
                    speak English; very few speak Spanish. And then, of course, the islands of
                    Honduras are populated by former pirate-type people, and they are white but
                    they're like the whites you find in the Chesapeake Bay, speak very interesting
                    English, very interesting accent and vocabulary in English, and have absolutely
                    nothing to do with the mainland of Honduras except they are part of the country.
                    Many of them, most of them, speak Spanish, and most Hondurans don't speak
                    English. Those sort of examples are really small in terms of the overall
                    population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have missionaries and if so, how did they fit in
                        from your perspective?</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, we talked about deliberation theology business the other time.
                    Most of them were doing missionary work, but I would say that the most
                    significant religious operators were Protestant. In fact, the growth of the
                    Protestant sects, if you will, in Central America was really very obvious in
                    Honduras, and the Catholic Church just had not delivered, and what was not
                    delivered to the people, the spiritual or personal support that they looked to,
                    and the growth of Angelical movements in Honduras was phenomenal. I was always
                    surprised to see the Mormons there, they were there in a big way, Protestants.
                    Mennonites were there, but the big ones were the Evangelicals, and the
                    population responded positively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have an agenda other than conversion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Not that I knew of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't finding them sort of aligning themselves so
                        there really wasn't the downtrodden that there might be in other
                        places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, by our terms certainly would be downtrodden, but there wasn't
                    the contrast between the downtrodden, those that have and those that don't have,
                    and the contrast was much less significant because there just wasn't ever any
                    money in Honduras. What money there was, was generally controlled by the
                    American Banana Company. There were a number of people that had money, probably
                    had millions of dollars, but it was only a handful as opposed to Nicaragua,
                    Salvador and Guatemala. They don't have the wherewithal to make more money, or
                    at least not the method we use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the press there?</hi>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, they called themselves independent but they were very party
                    affiliated, and the difference between the political parties was sort of hard to
                    discern. It was mainly based on family, family affiliation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, in 1992 it was time to move on. Actually I hadn't been in
                    Honduras two years even, but I was bidding and I got selected for the job of DCM
                    at the US mission to the OAS here in Washington, and everybody thought that was
                    a very good opportunity and so did I and so I took it. So I left Honduras in
                    April, left my husband there. One of the conditions was that he would stay until
                    August so that I could get released early. So I left and came back to Washington
                    into the mission to the OAS, and I was the deputy for Luigi R. Einaudi who, you
                    may know, is career State Department person but not a Foreign Service Officer.
                    He came from RAND in the civil service, and he was at the time ambassador to the
                    OAS.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were doing this from '92 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I did it first from '92 until about July of '95, and then I went to
                    senior seminar and then another job, and I was recalled back to the mission in
                    January of '97 and spent another year till the summer of '98, and then I went
                    off and headed the Pan American Development Foundation, which is associated, of
                    course, with the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll stick to the '93-'95 period. Could you tell me how
                        the OAS was seen sort of from the State Department eyes in this particular
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was a very good period for the OAS. The OAS historically has been
                    stronger or weaker, I think, depending on the state of US relations with the
                    hemisphere, Western Hemisphere, and of course that is dictated by how
                    unilateralist we are at the particular time and how much interest there is in
                    the hemisphere. In 1992 a couple events had preceded it which made for a very
                    high-level interest in the OAS. First of all, Central Americans wars of the
                    1980s meant that attention was still, let's say, higher than normal in the
                    Western Hemisphere. Secondly, the Bush Administration had been very clear that
                    it wanted to approach problems multilaterally. So with the interest in the
                    Western Hemisphere and the multilateral emphasis on foreign policy, there tended
                    to be in the United States a special focus on the OAS. In addition - well, maybe
                    partly related to those first two things - in 1990 the OAS had taken a decision
                    that any interruption of the democratic order would be grounds for action. Of
                    course, that whole principle of democracy being a sine qua non because of
                    membership in OAS had been there from the very beginning, but it had never
                    really been adhered to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For most of the time we're talking about, it had been run
                        by dictators.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Anyway, in 1990 they had taken this decision that had invoked this
                    resolution called 1080, the number that was given to it. They had used that
                    resolution twice already when I came in April, once against Haiti when President
                    Aristide was overthrown, and already they invoked it against President Fujimori
                    for his actions in Peru. So, it was a very exciting time to be there. The OAS
                    really was the focus of US policy makers. Probably because of that it was also
                    the focus of a number of other important countries' foreign policy, Brazil,
                    Argentina, Chile, Canada - Canada had just joined - and they all had very good
                    missions' ambassadors. As happens so often, the policy is made by people on the
                    ground and how effective they are: smart, capable, and such. There was a good
                    bunch of key country ambassadors and missions that were very well prepared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why hadn't Canada been a member before, and why did it
                        become a member at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, they hadn't been a member before because, much like the United
                    States - in fact, more so - Canada's focus had always been towards Europe, Great
                    Britain and Europe, and they had never taken any steps to become members. I
                    think they were changing as they saw more and more trade with the hemisphere
                    developing as important...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking now about the time of the North American
                        Free Trade Agreement and things were beginning to come together there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: That's right, and Canada was beginning to look a little more, a lot
                    more, towards this hemisphere because of the importance economically, and I
                    think politically too. The Cuba issue, I don't know if it factored in Canadian
                    thinking, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did, if they saw a way to make a
                    mark for themselves with their sort of peace-loving ways, that Canada is famed
                    for in terms of brokering a deal between the United States and Cuba. None of
                    that came to pass, but you can see both politically and economically, and the
                    Canadians often do operate in the OAS as a counterweight to the United States,
                    very much interested in showing that they are not necessarily as one with the
                    United States. And, of course they've been in the same positions as the United
                    States has on issues. Canada had joined very recently; 1990 I think it was, and
                    they were the newcomer, very interested and very active in the bureaucratic
                    routine. So it was a very exciting time to be at the OAS, and the United States
                    emphasis was on strengthening the role of that organization in terms of
                    consolidating democracy in the hemisphere. It was the first time probably ever
                    that the countries of the hemisphere had democratically elected governments,
                    except Cuba of course; Cuba is still suspended from the OAS. It was an exciting
                    time to be there, much as Central America had been exciting time, because it was
                    so much the center of policy. It was an exciting time to be at the OAS because
                    things were happening and there was an opportunity to do things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived during the Bush administration. Was there a
                        trust as far as the OAS was concerned that the Organization of American
                        States under the Bush administration, when the Clinton administration came
                        in was changed at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I would say so, although it didn't become apparent to me right away.
                    When Clinton came in, we got a new ambassador to the OAS, Hattie Babbitt, a
                    political appointee and very closely connected with the Administration,
                    especially with the Vice President, who had come out of NDI, the National
                    Democratic Institute, and had particular interest in human rights and the rule
                    of law. Because of her interest...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her name again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Hattie Babbitt, Harriet Babbitt. In fact, she's the deputy
                    administrator in AID right now. She moved after four or five years, she moved
                    over there. Her interest and her connections made the attention the OAS was
                    getting probably stronger than it would have otherwise been in the first Clinton
                    term and that was very beneficial for the Organization and, I think, for the
                    hemisphere because we were able to do things, say things, that, had we had a
                    career person, probably we would not have been able to do. In that sense it was
                    a very good use of a political appointee. In my view she was a very good
                    political appointee. But the down side of that from my perspective, of course,
                    is that I didn't realize until fairly well into the second Clinton term just how
                    little the Clinton Administration really felt about foreign policy at all, much
                    less the hemisphere. So that was rather a rude awakening. Because of the
                    connections we had there in the OAS, we were able to get involvement, action,
                    decisions on things that affected the OAS, that the rest of the people doing
                    policy in Latin America couldn't really get. That sort of deluded me into
                    thinking that there really was an active group in foreign policy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alec Watson was the Assistant Secretary for part of that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: For part of the time, yes, and then, of course, he left and went to
                    the Nature Conservancy. The first Assistant Secretary when I arrived, I think,
                    was Bernie Aaronson, and then Alec Watson and then at the end Jeff David Albert.
                    There was a lot going on in the hemisphere and I think the United States started
                    pulling back. It's a phenomenon that one sees a lot vis-�-vis the region, that
                    when things are going well or moderately well, seemingly in the right direction
                    if not well in and of itself, we didn't, and then when we're right back to pay
                    attention again when catastrophes tend to happen.</p>

                        that was absorbing your attention at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: There are a couple of incidents that I can remember. First of all,
                    there was the Fujimori problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, Fujimori essentially closed down the legislative and judicial
                    branches in, I think, April...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Chile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, it was in Peru.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean Peru, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: ...leaving the president, and still is. So the OAS called him to
                    task and said that this was in fact an interruption of democratic order, which
                    was an interesting position because before that time one essentially had talked
                    about the sort of presidential positions and a coup to that position the
                    interruption of the democratic order and hadn't even stopped to think about the
                    legislative branch. And Fujimori wanted to close it down, and so that was
                    another first step on the road to strengthening democracy that the legislators
                    operated independently. Fujimori engineered toe so-called the alta volta, the
                    sort of self coup. He remained in power and he in fact shut down the
                    legislature. That was interesting from the perspective of working in the OAS
                    because he did back down. The Organization was probably not as strong against
                    him and his actions as it should have been, because over the years we're seeing
                    him grasping more and more power and most recently this spring. Who knows
                    whether that will come to pass as the Organization is really getting
                    stronger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the Organization says you're a bad boy, then what do
                        they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, that's quite a question, because, unlike the United Nations
                    which has the Security Council which, for example, can impose sanctions,
                    everything in the OAS is voluntary, and its decisions are reached by consensus.
                    Many people criticize the Organization for that. It requires such a lower
                    threshold of decision making in order to get them to a consensus. Other people,
                    on the other hand, say that, despite that, the decisions end up being much
                    stronger once they are made. State can take their pick on that. But the question
                    also goes to the way Peru was handled in the time of the democracy period,
                    handled as opposed to the way the problems of democracy in Haiti were handled.
                    And the latter instance, Haiti, we, the Organization, much with United States'
                    assistance, backed the embargo, which was more or less effective. But
                    nonetheless there was this action taken to try and bring the perpetrators of
                    this coup to their knees. In the case of Peru no such action was taken, and
                    there was much criticism by the Caribbean nations that the extreme use of this
                    tool would only be directed against people of color. The reason, of course, it
                    wasn't directed against Fujimori was because he was one of the majority in the
                    Organization, and that had some serious repercussions thereafter because the
                    voting in the OAS is one-vote/one-state, population has nothing to do with it,
                    so Brazil has the same voting voice as St. Kitts which is itself rather
                    peculiar. But in the event that tools such as the embargwhich have only been
                    used once to my knowledge - are not effective, the only thing the Organization
                    has is moral suasion. If one can get a solid consensus on a point, that's not
                    insignificant, as long as, of course, there are some messages, if you will, of
                    democracy and one can build up pressure that way. But it's a peculiar
                    organization in many respects.</p>

                        how did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Luigi is a brilliant man politically but has little interest or
                    inclination for management organizations but brilliant from a strategic
                    perspective, and very highly knowledgeable about the hemisphere and the OAS
                    itself. So the way we divided things was you would think up a great plan and
                    then I would marshal the troops and what have you and executive it, which was, I
                    found, a splendid way to proceed because it plays to his strength and it plays
                    to my strength. We were very fluid. I think we got a lot of things done, and for
                    me, particularly since I didn't know the OAS when I took the job, it was a great
                    learning experience to be exposed to his knowledge and his strategizing. Now,
                    with Hattie Babbitt we worked a little differently in that she didn't want to be
                    bothered with marshaling the troops but would on issues of very important
                    stability, and issues of human rights. At that point she came in January of '93.
                    She would take those issues, and then I would choose a couple of issues, and
                    then we kind of go both ahead and I would check with her and such. But then I
                    had under my own control specific issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take an issue and what would you do, marshalling the
                        troops, going ahead...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: For example, one of the things that was very important right when
                    she came in was the election of the successor Secretary General. Secretaries
                    General in the OAS are elected every five years, and the election was coming up.
                    I can't remember now if it was in '93 or '94. We actually sat down, looked over
                    the various candidates, figured out which the United States could support
                    politically and practically, which one we could give our bid. Then she developed
                    this very carefully thought-out plan about how we were going to go about
                    persuading other countries to support the candidate we supported without showing
                    our cards to the others. Well, everybody knew who we were supporting in the end,
                    so it's no big deal at this point in time. Now, she marshaled troops, if you
                    will, on that issue and did so very effectively, as we sort of looked at each
                    country and figured out how to get that country to come to the same conclusion
                    that we have. In some cases it involved trips to the capital; in other cases it
                    involved much more sort of brass tact discussions: “What will it take to get
                    your vote?” I found that very interesting because I'd never been involved in an
                    election campaign of any sort, and I suppose that's much the way in campaigns,
                    be they local, regional, provincial, national, international, that's the way one
                    approaches it. Of course, she had background in it since her husband had run for
                    office. He had been elected governor of Arizona and had run unsuccessfully as
                    the Democratic candidate...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: And he's now Secretary of the Interior, yes. So she had had, I
                    presume, that sort of exposure. In any case, my opinion, watching this thing
                    unfold, was that she certainly brought to the process knowledge and skills about
                    how to go about it. Frankly I wouldn't have had a clue. So that's one issue.
                    Subsequently another issue that I actually handled was the combined budgetary
                    and political aspects. As you may remember, after the Central American war
                    finished, because of the reduced interest by the United States and the
                    hemisphere, we were slashing AID budgets. In fact the budget of the OAS was not
                    actually slashed; we managed to keep it on a straight line. We weren't getting
                    the increases that we had been getting in previous years when money was not a
                    big concern. I think the deficit was a big part of all that too now that I think
                    back to it. Anyway, so the idea was how could we get the Organization to waste
                    less money and shift its substantive focus to areas of concern to us. Of course,
                    the whole democracy consolidation was one of our issues, areas of interest, and
                    another one was the Clinton administration's concern with the environment, and
                    the third one I can't remember. So we had three principal areas that we wanted
                    the Organization to spend more time and more money on. That was one of the
                    issues that I had, and I got myself elected chair of the Budget Committee, and
                    then led the Budget Committee, which consisted of all states who wanted to
                    participate, led those representatives through a process whereby we would get
                    the increases that we were looking for. It was a very long, torturous process,
                    because it was mixed up in this huge personnel suit by the employees of the OAS
                    against organization for failure to give salary increases and such over the
                    years, but the bill for that came to millions of dollars and so that was mixed
                    in. The first year we managed to get the budgetary increase in the substantive
                    areas that we wanted by persuading the other countries to go along with us. We
                    were not able to solve that personnel suit, that litigation, until a year later,
                    but we managed to do that without incurring additional financial problems. The
                    reason costs were so important was that the United States paid 59.6, 60 percent
                    essentially, of the budget, so that kind of invoked a lot of Congressional
                    oversight, not just because it's such a large percentage but because the sums of
                    money actually started to be significant in terms of the results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're talking about money, what does the money
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, that's a good question. The Congress asked that too. For the
                    most part, the OAS pays salaries and it pays for programs in democracies, for
                    example, they have seminars, that they're now doing by sub-region, on how to
                    have an election, how to register people to vote, how to run a campaign, how to
                    get out the vote, what are the standards that should be applied to the judicial
                    branch, things that go to strengthen the democratic air and essentially for many
                    of the countries building awareness of how it works elsewhere, because for many
                    of the countries democracy is so shallow and the idea that you have elections
                    and you have a democracy is really elementary. So the idea was to bring those
                    groups and individuals along in countries that had not had exposure to this so
                    that they would be putting those demands on their on society for aspects of
                    political life that they hadn't been exposed to. Now, for example the
                    environment, we again would fund workshops and seminars with counterparts here
                    in the United States, be they national or state or local or government agencies
                    or NGOs, so that people would again see how it's possible to bring pressure to
                    make change and conserve their environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that being in Washington and being able to draw on
                        the political process here including NGOs was a great asset.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Absolutely. Although we often found that the more effective way to
                    go about was to have countries other than the United States involved in this
                    sharing. The United States and the Western Hemisphere is viewed as sort of god
                    like and devil like at the same time. So the same lesson imparted by, if you
                    will, one of their own would be much better received frequently than imparted by
                    an American whoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little too much like lecturing to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, exactly, and so we would often fund exchanges between, for
                    example, Caribbean and South American. One of the programs we were working on on
                    the environment was to have the Caribbean folks instruct or share with Central
                    Americans how they use natural resources for the tourist trade, thereby getting
                    income for lower-income-level folks to sort of come up the economic ladder while
                    at the same time conserving environmental aspects of the tourist industry. That
                    worked out very nicely, because of course the Caribbeans have been doing that
                    for years for tourists coming in. Central Americans were just starting with the
                    advent of ecotourism, and so there was something they could share profitably,
                    and it wasn't the United States coming in in its sort of bromide approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think in the OAS - again, I've never served in
                        Latin America, but just looking at it - I would think there would be a group
                        of prima donnas - and I consider the United States to be obviously one of
                        them - Mexico, Brazil and perhaps Canada, trotting on the stage, but in a
                        way all of them wanted to a certain extent put down the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes. Well, you've touched on a couple of things. First of all,
                    there's a very different view of what the OAS should do depending on their
                    internal political philosophy. The United States, for example, goes fairly
                    strictly by the charter, democracy, human rights, and what have you, and that's
                    what the OAS should be about. Now, countries like Mexico - I guess is the
                    classic one - will say, “Well, that's all very well and good, but overriding in
                    any sort of democracy you might have a tendency for external meddling.” It's a
                    whole principle of sovereignty and nonintervention. “So we can talk about it,
                    but I don't want this organization doing anything or saying anything about what
                    goes on within my borders, because you shouldn't be interfering. So you can make
                    general platitude kind of pronouncements, but we're not going to do anything.”
                    Then you have the sort of Caribbean group, most of which became independent and
                    therefore were able to join the OAS only in the last '60s and '70s, and they
                    look to the OAS primarily as a source of financial assistance because, again,
                    the United States thinks primarily of its political arm but it also has a
                    technical assistance and development arm, and so the Caribbeans, the small
                    countries, and some of the small Latin ones too, Paraguay, Bolivia and such,
                    traditionally have thought of it primarily in terms of “How much money can you
                    give me?” or the complement of bilateral assistance in the embassies. So you do
                    have all these different sort of agendas going in the place, which is why it's
                    often very difficult to get people to pay attention. If one country wants to
                    accomplish something on the political level, oftentimes just two or three
                    countries opposing, if they're willing to be engaged in their opposition, are
                    enough to squash the whole deal because there are so many nonplayers, if you
                    will. At the same time that very phenomenon, if you can get four or five
                    countries to really sort of do a slam-dunk and you're sure that there isn't
                    anybody in strong opposition, you can get something agreed to. But it makes it
                    very difficult. I never quite understood and I used to question my Mexican and
                    Brazilian particular colleagues about what struck me as rather unusual,
                    anomalous kind of behavior, because with the emphasis on nonintervention, it
                    always seemed to me that those countries who cared about that were sort of
                    inviting the United States to go at it alone. If I had been in their shoes, I
                    would have done everything I could to rope the United States into this OAS and
                    at least have some semblance that something was happening or whatever to
                    preclude the United States saying, “The hell with it. We'll just go in like we
                    did in the Dominican Republican.” Well, we did get our way elsewhere.</p>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: So let me think of another example. I can't think of one of the top
                    of my head now. So as to preclude our going at things unilaterally, and yet many
                    times they would just dig in their heels, and maybe they had a better reading
                    than I of what the United States would really do in the end. I think the United
                    States would have been prepared - that's an interesting question - I think it
                    would have been prepared to go alone on Haiti, because during the coup or after,
                    the year following the coup, in 1992, I guess it was, or '91, the domestic
                    political impact of all the refugees streaming out from Haiti...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: ...our officers being gored in a bad way. Florida is a really
                    important state for elections, for presidential elections, so I suppose that we
                    would have gone along on Haiti if we hadn't been successful in the OAS, and
                    being successful in the OAS was sort of the precondition for going to the United
                    Nations. So when we were pulling out of the OAS, then that gate sort of opened
                    the door to go into the United Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the Haiti situation, because this is one
                        of the major ones, could you give me a feel for dealing, say, with some of
                        the nationalities and personalities that you were dealing with, the
                        Mexicans, the Brazilians maybe, some of the Jamaicans and the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Sure. Well, let's start with the Mexicans, their being such close
                    neighbors. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs is dominated - it may be
                    changing now; it's hard to say now with President Fox having been elected; well,
                    of course, he hasn't taken office - was traditionally dominated by old-line
                    folks who espouse, I guess, the original tenets of the principal Mexican
                    political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mexico, I think, has -
                    the Institutional Revolutionary Party - maintained its grip and, therefore, its
                    tradition of controlling Mexico for the last 70 or 80 years, I think in great
                    measure by copying revolution and antagonism in foreign policy while copying
                    socialism, rather corrupt socialism, domestically. So Mexico as an international
                    organization, or at least in the OAS, would not want any focus on its internal
                    affairs, as I mentioned earlier, and would take very extreme positions on
                    external matters. Mexico was very difficult to deal with in the OAS, and we sort
                    of had the conclusion, or the staff concluded, that Mexico really wasn't
                    interested in the OAS doing anything. That made sense because they wouldn't want
                    OAS to do anything about, even look at, what was happening domestically is
                    Mexico. The Mexicans were very difficult at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're talking about Mexico - we talked about
                        Fujimori - was it sort of a no-no to question whether Mexico was a democracy
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, yes. In fact, when I stayed there in '92, you certainly wouldn't
                    do that. Moreover, to tell you how far the organization came within, say, a
                    period of five years, or three or four years, you would never mention the word
                    'corruption' because 'corruption' implied that you were looking within
                    somebody's national borders. I think it was in '95 we were able to get a code of
                    conduct on the question of corruption, which then served as a model for other
                    codes. So the first one actually happened in the OAS. It was an extraordinary
                    thing, I thought, that these countries would agree to have it talked about. Now,
                    it didn't point a finger at any particular country, but at least it talked about
                    corruption and how the absence of it and things that could be done were vital
                    for a sound democratic system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Mexico I - from just talking to people - had the
                        feeling that the foreign ministry was sort of staffed by sort of quite
                        extreme left-wing intellectuals, sort of the extreme left wing of the French
                        Socialist Party, that type of people, and this is where they were sort of
                        kept, it was their playpen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was their playpen, and it didn't really make any different to
                    Mexico, because they could say what they want and it was about foreign affairs,
                    it was about Cuba, it was about the United States. They had no relevance to what
                    was going inside of Mexico except that it functioned as a safety valve so that
                    the whole rah-rah and their satisfaction of what was going on domestically was
                    vented for the benefit of the population via this extreme behavior in foreign
                    affairs. That's the way I saw it. Now, Brazil is different. Brazil shared with
                    Mexico a lot of this sovereignty and nonintervention, but it never seemed quite
                    as rabid. Brazilian diplomats are probably the best I've ever run into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is something I've heard again and again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Very, very sharp and very well trained, meticulous, whereas the
                    Mexicans were more just sort of lax. The Brazilians were incredibly disciplined.
                    You knew that anything you said was back in Brasilia in a matter of hours. We
                    would have it coming back time and time again. I respected that a lot. I don't
                    think that they really viewed foreign policy in the same way. They just didn't
                    have that sort of a balance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they weren't trying to prove something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, Brazil thinks it's a real country. It is a real country, and it
                    doesn't have any hang-ups really as far as the United States is concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As contrasted to Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes. Now, Canada had just joined. I wish I could remember the exact
                    date, but anyway in the 90's. The ambassador there in '92 and everybody in that
                    mission was the first sort of assignment. In that sort of set of assignment, the
                    Canadians were essentially feeling their way. Their main thing was the money.
                    “If we're going to stay here, we need to see how the money is being used.” That
                    refrain, of course, continued but even later, but then more in terms of interest
                    in specific political issues and economic issues as well. In the beginning the
                    Canadians were without hang-ups. They knew they were the new kid on the block,
                    they were learning the system, they were learning the hang-ups there, and the
                    main thing was the money. Over time, I'd say into the next set of assignments,
                    they became much more vocal, more professional but that's obvious, more
                    interested in their own agenda as separate from the United States, and more
                    interested across the board in trying to show to some extent that they were
                    really the hope for the hemisphere. In fact, the culmination of that so far has
                    been this year that virtually every hemispheric meeting has taken place in
                    Canada in one city or another. They volunteered to do everything. It's not an
                    insignificant expense to host one of these international meetings. They tried
                    outside of the OAS to take the lead in the hemisphere and in fixing things with
                    Fidel and had gotten rather badly burned at that. I would say the OAS is better
                    for their presence than not. The OAS is so strained because when the U.S. pays
                    60 percent of the bill, it's very hard, almost impossible, not to be the
                    heavyweight, and people know it. It's a rather sick kind of situation if one
                    comes from the premise of you've got 34 independent and equally sovereign states
                    and then one of them is paying 60 percent of the bill, so you have the
                    Canadians. Now, the Caribbean was divided up. You have the big countries,
                    Jamaica, Trinidad - what else do we have out there? Cuba of course is suspended.
                    I think Jamaica and Trinidad, the Dominican Republic. Let me talk about the
                    Dominican Republic, because that was a real interesting example. President
                    Balaguer had been in power for God knows how many years in the Dominion
                    Republic. During the course of my tenure in the OAS, I think he withdrew. I
                    don't think he ran for office, but his candidate was defeated and there was a
                    new administration after many, many years in the Dominican Republic. That was
                    fascinating in terms of watching how a country's policies could just change
                    overnight. So much of what the previous ambassador had done at the OAS was
                    clearly sort of how much he could get away with on knowing Balaguer's position
                    and knowing that Balaguer was old, sick blind, what have you. Then you get this
                    new young administration in the Dominican Republic at least nominally interested
                    in democracy and doing things right, and you could just see the Dominican
                    Republic's position on issues go from black to white. It was interesting. It
                    doesn't happen with the United States. Our policies remain more or less
                    consistent. I don't know if it's the size of the country or the extremeness of
                    President Balaguer. Jamaica and Trinidad were the first countries in the
                    Caribbean, English-speaking Caribbean countries, to join OAS. They had a larger
                    mission to the OAS, and they were, therefore, more prepared. To be on top of
                    issues in a multilateral organization required a fair amount of time and,
                    therefore, staff. So with the little missions - little like two or three people
                    would do - they'd just write off issues and just not pay any attention. The
                    larger ones, of course, could have help studying all of them and working those
                    issues. So Jamaica and Trinidad often proved to be the leaders, so whatever
                    positions they took, the littler countries would follow because they just
                    assumed they had some common interests and they didn't have the time. It was
                    difficult for the United States operating in a multilateral environment in the
                    western hemisphere. And the relationships between the United States and
                    virtually everyone in the Western Hemisphere has been so much historically, well
                    when we cared. We would say. “Jump,” and the response is “How high?” not whether
                    you jump or not, and you just didn't see that at this time in a multilateral
                    organization. I think that made it very difficult for the United States. I
                    remember one Assistant Secretary when one of the many times Peru flared up at
                    the OAS, who was just beside himself with ire, and I remember him just screaming
                    at me, “What do you mean you can't get them to adopt” whatever it was we wanted
                    on that particular day?” I would say, “There are 34 countries, and these five
                    aren't going to do it and, therefore, the rest are not going to along with us,
                    so we need to find a variation of this theme so we can move these four or five,
                    whatever they were, off this complete recalcitrance into at least not
                    objecting.” So he said, “You can't do it. I'll damn well go there and do it
                    myself,” and then he charges over there - which, of course, points out another
                    difficulty of working with the OAS. If you always have your boss there, it made
                    it difficult more for the ambassador than it did for a DCM, because while the
                    OAS is the ambassador's turf and the Assistant Secretary should really, I
                    suppose, have a sense of moderation in terms of dipping their toes into his
                    turf, but it's kind of irresistible when it's only three blocks away. Anyway, so
                    there he goes storming over there trying to read the riot act to these people
                    and concludes it's not going to happen. But the ire that got provoked was very
                    instructive and caused a lot of irritation in the State Department because it
                    was so unusual that in dealings with the hemisphere people would say no, because
                    by and large over the years people, countries have said yes to the United
                    States. That we paid most of the bills probably helped it, but nonetheless I
                    started out by saying how it does make for a certain imbalance when your paying
                    60 percent of the bill, but nonetheless there were several instances in which I
                    can remember their saying “Absolutely not.” And this spring on Peru, which has
                    nothing to do with me because I gone but it was clear from the newspaper they
                    just said no and the United States was very angry. [Inaudible.] Oh, yes, the
                    election. Fujimori had 59 percent and he didn't want to postpone the run-off or
                    whatever, so I guess we went in the lead trying to force a delay in a run-off
                    election so that the contender, the other contender, could have fair access to
                    the media and such and, you know, you couldn't get the rest of the Organization
                    to go along.</p>

                        this would have stirred up concern with the rest of the OAS people by
                        seeing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right, it did. And it particularly stirred up resentment on the part
                    of the Caribbean missions who had long been promised that CBI legislation,
                    Caribbean Based Initiative legislation, which, if I understand correctly, was to
                    give tariff-free access on textiles and other finished products produced in the
                    Caribbean. Well, that might have happened on that last six months. But anyway,
                    the Caribbean nations felt very much that this promise to them had been made
                    before the actual discussion began in earnest, and it caused a lot of resentment
                    that we were proceeding with NAFTA. It was also a concern, I guess, in that
                    Canada, probably as a very practical matter, often used the same people as the
                    OAS for other sort of multilateral issues that were going on. For example, when
                    the whole Summit of the Americas process started, Canada used the same people,
                    whereas in the United States they were different. In the case of Mexico, the
                    other leader, they sort of overlapped. That made it rather disjointed. For
                    example, on NAFTA the mission, in effect the Latin American Bureau in the State
                    Department, had very little to do with that until just the actual negotiations.
                    It was all done by the Trade Representative's office, with, I suppose,
                    clearances from State, but the real work was done by the Trade Representative's
                    office. Now, State Department was very much involved in the lobbying thereafter
                    to try and get passage of it, but not the actual negotiations. So the Summit
                    said the details of NAFTA were not really in the OAS, and the only real
                    follow-up work on NAFTA that was done by the OAS had to do with building a trade
                    base, a data base on barriers to trade, which is a useful thing to do, of
                    course, and is appreciated most by the countries that need it the most. NAFTA
                    was not that big an issue in the OAS, as I say, for the most part intentionally
                    by the United States.</p>

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, again, that was a USTR (United States Trade Representative)
                    thing. We would get some of the spillover because it surely was, and still is, a
                    very active player in international scene, but we didn't actually do any
                    negotiations. They still thought they might have a need for doing something at
                    the OAS, but if they did, we were not the ones speaking. USTR had their person
                    right there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No, the Congressional folks did not fish in our waters. We would
                    talk to the budget folks up on the Hill, but essentially we didn't have much
                    interference. They looked on the OAS as place apart. Maybe what we should do or
                    leave for the next time... You know, one of the things you said or I said
                    reminded me that the OAS is sort of the linchpin of what's more broadly called
                    the Inter-American System. Although I mentioned the political end of the OAS and
                    the technical assistance and development end, there was also security apparatus,
                    which is, of course, much weaker now than it was say during World War II. And
                    there were various other bodies in the human rights' courts, which heard cases
                    and actually ran their judgments involving financial consequences. So the
                    Inter-American System, when one speaks of the OAS, oftentimes people mean the
                    whole Inter-American System. Alternatively they might mean what is more
                    specifically called the Permanent Council, which drives the political end of
                    things, but what time is it; I have to go.</p>

                    impression of how the OAS worked? You were there when to when?</p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I was there from April of '92 to July of '95, and then I was back
                    there again from January of '97 to the summer of '98, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how it functioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, whether it functioned and how it functioned was very much a
                    factor of who was there, because during the different periods when I was either
                    working in the mission or otherwise closely associated with the OAS, I had the
                    opportunity to see very good functioning and just abysmal functioning. For
                    example, during the early '90s - I think we've already talked about - there was
                    a cadre of excellent ambassadors from the key countries, the United States,
                    Argentina, Brazil, Trinidad, Tobago, and that combination of people in
                    conjunction with a very astute Secretary General who was not politically
                    prominent - he was a career diplomat, a Brazilian diplomat - made it possible to
                    do things, to get important decisions on democracy and civil-military relations
                    done and accepted and then actually the beginnings of their implementation. At a
                    later time there were much more prominent Secretary Generals, one the President
                    of Colombia, and a collection of ambassadors who in their totality were not as
                    able, so we saw a lot more public attention to the OAS but a lot less real
                    action. As I consider and look back on it, it just seems to me that, like so
                    many institutions, I suppose, it so depends on the capabilities and
                    personalities of the people that are there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Maybe you can talk about, during the dates you were
                        talking about, dealing with problems, whether it worked, didn't work, and
                        why and so forth, in Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, Cuba, of course, since Castro has been a member but
                    nonparticipating member of the OAS. It was suspended technically not because of
                    its government but because of its export of revolution and that situation has
                    continued to the present day. It's rather tenuous legally at this point, since,
                    of course, Cuba didn't export any of its revolution anymore since the end of the
                    Cold War. But nonetheless that's still a situation that's really active. From
                    the United States' perspective, one of our great concerns was how to ward off
                    any sort of concerted attack by significant players in terms of bringing Cuba
                    back. That has been the whole U.S. approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our basic policy was just keep Cuba out, not looking at
                        conduct or anything like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, it's kind of hard - you're right - it's kind of hard to look
                    at conduct now, at least in terms of the conduct that led to its suspension,
                    certainly doesn't apply anymore, because it's not exporting revolution anymore.
                    So what the United States looked at is the same sort of issues that we talked
                    about bilaterally with Cuba, the sort of structured economy, the human rights
                    question, the totalitarian, if you will, form of government, but those are
                    tenuous in terms of a defense in the OAS inter-American system, because while
                    certainly the charter of the OAS talks about respect of human rights and
                    participative democracy, in fact other governments have been members who have
                    flouted these aspects.</p>
                <p>Just go through the Latin and Central American states and you can subdivide the
                    rest of the continent in different ways and come up with countries that fall
                    into just about every one of the objections we have against Cuba today. So that
                    was a great concern, because legally it's rather tenuous and politically, of
                    course, the Western Hemisphere with Canada in the forefront believe as do
                    Americans that the best way to effect change is wrap them in a shroud of
                    isolation. During the time I was there, and I think the case is still true
                    today, there certainly was no wavering in terms of what to do, what the position
                    should be, on Cuba, and we had a number of difficult moments, mainly caused not
                    by Cuba, who seems to be quite happy with the situation, but caused by
                    accomplishing other issues that made countries sort of coalesce together in
                    opposition to the United States, and so Cuba was sort of a handy other issue for
                    them to get started on. But the day will come, probably before we have changed
                    our policy the way things are going, where it will be a more serious threat for
                    the OAS from the perspective of bilateral policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does it take to make membership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, it's non-functioning membership because Cuba is a member. In
                    fact, if you look at the flags of the OAS whenever they fly the flags, the Cuban
                    flag is there. They are a member. The whole quota system is based upon if Cuba
                    were paying, so there's always that small percentage that had never paid because
                    Cuba had been suspended, so they don't pay nor do they get any benefits. So they
                    are a member, they are listed, their flag is flown, they have no seat at the
                    table, although I kind of wonder whether that's a political statement or
                    practical issue, because there simply isn't room with all the new states that
                    came in the '70s and the table in the room has never been changed. You kind of
                    wonder what you get. We had dealt with the Cuba issue, the United States had
                    dealt with it, both on a political level as discussed earlier and on a practical
                    level. I can't remember the name of the amendment, but there is an amendment
                    that's been appropriated, this longstanding appropriation, legislation which
                    says that - I think it applies to all international organizations because of
                    course I can't see how it would apply to the United Nations, but it does apply
                    to the Inter-American System - if any of the OAS money, Inter-American System
                    money, goes to Cuba, that much doubled if subtracted from what the United States
                    will pay to the Organization. So we dealt with the Cuba issue on sort of two
                    levels, if you will, at the OAS.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, were you all individually or
                        collectively tweaked by the other countries by saying, “Why are you doing
                        this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, we were tweaked, we were tweaked publicly. People would make
                    references to Cuba in their various speeches in appropriate sort of contexts
                    from their perspective. It would be done publicly in the form of sessions. It
                    would also be privately. But I think most people recognize that the locus of
                    US-Cuba policy making was not in relation to the OAS. Much like when I was doing
                    Ireland work, the desk, the Bureau was not the Ireland policy, US-Ireland or
                    US-Northern Ireland policy. No, that was in the White House, because it was
                    going to have a domestic constituency. I think the people, the foreigners in the
                    OAS realizes that the same thing is true. It's still the policy. There wasn't
                    anything we could do about. So they could rattle our cages privately, and what
                    could we say, and publicly they could go so far but they didn't go that far,
                    because they did not want to alienate the United States. This is where we get
                    back to the imbalance in the American system between the United States and
                    everybody else, both on a political and a very pragmatic level. They would never
                    mess with the money aspect of Cuba business in the Inter-American System because
                    they just knew. They rant and rave and about how we're paying our quotas as we
                    have heard the last few years at the UN, but in the end it wasn't going to make
                    any difference. We were not going to pay the money, so they never strayed from
                    the prohibition about directing resources towards Cuba. I can't remember
                    exactly. There were some rather tense moments. I can't remember why or how they
                    came up, but one of those is what forms the basis for my statement that our
                    position in terms of the OAS and Cuba is rather tenuous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within your delegation and maybe within the OAS, if
                        expressed, if Cuba were readmitted into full participation it might not be
                        just so many but it might be the U.S. saying “Go your way.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I don't know. I don't know why we would ever do that. The trouble
                    with the Inter-American System, unlike the UN or somewhat unlike the UN, it's so
                    much more, it seems to me, dependent on the personalities, the personages if you
                    will, who are there and everybody realizes that. If you look at the history of
                    the OAS, it has had significant periods when it really didn't count for
                    anything. Some people say we're in a period like that right now. Part of what
                    makes such a period is the United States was turning its back, either
                    consciously or in terms of a positive action or just by ignoring, which I think
                    is more what people think is happening now. That affects the ability of the
                    Organization to function. It's of critical importance to not have that happen if
                    the Organization's going to function. So the idea that countries would ever
                    tweak us that badly that they would consciously send the United States into a
                    period of ignoring or disdaining the OAS, I think would be further than any of
                    them would want to go, even though at the same time I would say that one often
                    wonders, I wonder, about the reputation of the OAS and the Inter-American System
                    in the minds of foreign governments because oftentimes if one considers the
                    quality of ambassadors they send to Washington, the quality of representatives
                    in the defense board and the other, they call them, specialized entities that
                    they have on education or in other more technical fields, one says, “Well, that
                    country really doesn't care much about the Inter-American System or they would
                    have people with better qualifications and better access to the people in power
                    and such,” and so that sort of seems to say that they don't care about the
                    Inter-American System. Nonetheless I can't see the Western Hemisphere pushing
                    the United States that hard where they would run the risk of us just abandoning
                    the OAS. And I think that makes sense from their political perspective. One of
                    the things I never could understand all the years I was associated with it is
                    why, because of the asymmetry, why other countries didn't try their damnedest to
                    build up the system more. It's sort of like Gulliver. If you have this giant you
                    try and hamstring him, if you will, with all kinds of little strings and
                    commitments and what have you, as opposed to minimizing the number of strings
                    that were tying the giant to the ground and therefore leaving the giant more
                    operational to be able to do what the giant, the United States wanted to on its
                    own. I never understood this lack of depth of understanding of the Hemisphere,
                    but I never could figure it out because it seemed contrary to the other
                    countries' influence to not have this multilateral hemisphere system as strong
                    as possible because that is continuing influence.</p>

                        Hemisphere- were some more interested that others?</hi>

                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Different parts were interested in different things at different
                    times. For example, the Caribbean came into the OAS, I mean with one or two
                    exceptions, most of them became independent in the middle to late 70's, and so
                    they joined the OAS at that point. At the time they entered the OAS
                    Inter-American System they didn't feel that they needed the political support in
                    terms of democracy, human rights, sovereignty and such as the Latins might have
                    felt. They didn't ascribe to those concepts even for the Latins because they
                    looked at it fairly much as a charade, sort of words that would be mouthed, and
                    then as one looked at the concrete evolution of events in the Latin countries,
                    there was nothing to bear out that attitude. What they wanted from the
                    Inter-American System was money, and during the '70s and most of the '80s there
                    were significant amounts of money that went to the small countries, not just the
                    Caribbean but since we're speaking about them, great amounts of money in
                    specialized technical fields, education, science and technology, the arts,
                    preservation of some of their cultural heritage, and some for general economic
                    development. And that was their primary concern easily for 20-25 years after
                    they joined the Inter-American System. They tolerated the rest. They didn't have
                    powers. They weren't in the forefront. In the late '90s it changed only because
                    of their realization that monies had drawn back significantly, and they made a
                    link to some of the smaller countries that are now gone between security and
                    development and started on a political level arguing for things that had to do
                    with their process of security, the climate change issue, other
                    environmental-type issues, terrorism, and the narcotics business. And that
                    reflects the age and the fact that the amount of money they get out of
                    Inter-American System now is not terribly significant even for their small
                    economy. The representation of the Central Americans is a little bit different.
                    They were, of course, independent and part of the founding group of the OAS in
                    1948. They had not played a very prominent role and had pushed their own agenda
                    primarily only since the beginning of the '90s at the end of the Central
                    American conflict when they basically all had democratically elected presidents,
                    were trying to show that this was a zone of peace and therefore again worthy of
                    resources and making political points about peaceful resolution of disputes. The
                    Latin and the South Americans form Panama down South. Mexico's a different
                    place, so we'll leave that aside for now. The South American countries, I think,
                    have always looked at the OAS... Like so many of pronouncements, I am really
                    very much persuaded by the arguments that the former AID person, whose name is -
                    I can't remember right now. He has written several books, the name will come to
                    me. The thesis is development is the function of culture more than resources,
                    and it relates to the South American countries, as I see it, in that the culture
                    in those countries is very much.... If I say something is then it is, I don't
                    have to do anything about it, just putting it out on the table makes it a
                    reality as opposed to, I think, an Anglo-Saxon approach which is, of course,
                    shared by the Caribbeans and Canada in the Inter-American System, as you put
                    something out on the table and it is an aspiration or it is a commitment of
                    future action. It isn't necessarily a reality. I think the OAS was so into that
                    sort of cultural pattern as many South American countries, because the
                    aspirations, if you will, the commitments that were put on the table in 1948,
                    the birth of the modern OAS, certainly is not borne out by actions for many,
                    many years, until the last 10-15 years. So what the relationship is between that
                    state of affairs and the kind of people that were sent to the system, I don't
                    know. The money certainly was insignificant from the perspective of the size of
                    their economy. Politically I don't know that there is that much out of there,
                    again because of the size and complexity of their countries, that what was going
                    on at the OAS was, I have to say, relatively meaningless. There was a side show
                    and we have to remember that the OAS, birth of the OAS, came in 1948, and that
                    followed a significant period of hemispheric solidarity the way Inter-American
                    System worked during World War II. During World War II in 1942 at the signing of
                    the Rio Treaty - an attack against one is an attack against all, as it were -
                    this was all directed to what was going on in other parts of the world. When you
                    have euphoria after it is all said and done and you have this political system
                    set up and agreed to in 1948, think it was fairly distant from reality, but
                    there was euphoric high and the distance between what people hoped for in the
                    early '40s and what happened, I think, has been very great, and we're trying to
                    come together. We're in fact making great strides. I really think the early '90s
                    was considered a high point of the OAS.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have really democratic rules seemed to be on the

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It was on the march, but people are questioning right now whether it
                    was going to live much less if it's marching anywhere. Of course, that gets
                    reflected in the OAS. The more uncertainty there is in significant countries in
                    the OAS, the less the organization, because that's the country - we can't forget
                    that - is going to be able to do it. And I think that is explained why in the
                    last four or five years, the Organization has not been able to do that much. It
                    explains the behavior earlier this year of Peru, and the more countries that
                    feel unsettled about their own internal democracy, it's less likely that they
                    are going to want to connect themselves vis-�-vis one of their own because they
                    may be next. So it's difficult. But, you know, one thing that we haven't spoken
                    about that much is the Inter-American system at large. We have spoken about the
                    OAS and we had spoken primarily of political issues, and so in that sense it's
                    fitting that we've been talking about the OAS, but the web of hemispheric
                    relationships in fact extends far beyond the political arena and, I would say,
                    on the whole probably more successfully in the less political, more technical
                    areas. Now, in the science and technology liaison and the education liaison -
                    and they each have their sort of home body system - I think examples of
                    hemispheric unity can really benefit all of them. The exchange of experiences
                    between different levels at different times had developed, development in
                    undeveloped countries, all particular issues, where politics or international or
                    bilateral or multilateral relationships were essentially put aside. It was the
                    technical people working together or the Department of Education working on
                    education matters. I think those areas have been very successful. On the defense
                    and political/military relations, again here you see both situations exist, the
                    success and then the lack thereof, in terms of the Inter- American defense board
                    and the security arrangements in the hemisphere. From a high in the 40's because
                    of World War II and because of the Cold War to a large extent, although then as
                    the Cold War evolved, the hemisphere sort of started splitting in terms of
                    support. And when that started happening, it started falling by the wayside, and
                    now what we have is that the shells remain without much substance. One of the
                    things that went on for years and almost a decade or so, is what to do about the
                    hemispheric security institutions. What's the threat, are these proper tools to
                    deal with this threat, and so on. They haven't made much progress. So that falls
                    between, if you will, the technical and then the political side, in terms of
                    having once been a very useful instrument, and now just being a shell
                    waiting.</p>

                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, exactly. So that's why people aren't doing anything. One could
                    kill, and there have been numerous to do so, particularly since many of the
                    later entrants to the system never saw security in military terms as did the
                    original crew, such as the Caribbean and Canada, therefore never joined the
                    security institutionso you have a rather nominal situation where it's called the
                    inter-American Defense Board but it is not really inter-American because there
                    are like 12 or 13 countries, as I just mentioned, that aren't members and have
                    no interest in being members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the lack of interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, historically part of it has to do with the fact that until
                    three of four years ago you had to have a military representative there. So they
                    were effectively excluded. They changed that four years or five years ago but at
                    the same time in what has become even more prominent now is the fact of what is
                    the point, and most of these countries are so poor that even for the OAS they
                    may have two people, so they're not about to squander resources on something
                    that they see just as needing someone. Why should they bother?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just need someone to supply the troops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: It is, yes, and they don't anticipate needing it anyway, and that is
                    part of the problem. It was formed for extra-hemispheric aggression, to guard
                    against it. Where's the threat against the hemisphere coming from? In terms of a
                    military threat, there really isn't one. Then is the inter-American defense
                    board going take on environment security and what's the role of the military,
                    should you define one of your security concerns as environmental security, and
                    what's the military going to do about that? Of course, we have the same debate
                    in this country, and the military does have significant other purposes more
                    significant than environmental. In the case of Canada, while certainly they had
                    a military, although this law was changed before Canada joined the OAS, which
                    was only in 1990 or 1991, they just consider it a waste of time and money, and
                    so they're actually in the forefront of people or countries saying, “Let's stay
                    out. What are we going to do at this point?” It's not big bucks in your budget
                    terms, but still just relatively small, a couple million dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, if you're looking at it from our perspective it
                        is not a bad idea to have military people at all these places talking to
                        each other so that it makes it more likely to not go off on your own.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I suppose there's something to that, but again you get into
                    who's sent by which government to the Inter-American Defense Board. And
                    historically it has been the case where the finest and the brightest were not
                    sent; get the coup leader out of town. And oftentimes military officers in
                    disgrace were sent off as ambassadors of that country to another Latin American
                    or European country to get them out of Dallas, and the same thing is true in the
                    OAS, so you get your undesirables out of Dallas and you put them somewhere where
                    it doesn't really matter. So here you have the chicken and the egg, the
                    Inter-American Defense Board and the supplies to the civilian post at the OAS
                    too are less than the most competent, best placed if you will, people, best
                    viewed people, placed at the Defense Board and at the OAS because those
                    institutions are not highly regarded. Which comes first and how do you correct
                    that, and where's the motivation? Back in the early '90s, for whatever reason -
                    and I have spent a lot of time thinking about why it is, whether it was just
                    happenstance or whether something had really happened in the hemisphere to get
                    this critical mass of really great ambassadors at the OAS. We never had a
                    critical mass of really good defense folks at the Defense Board, and those
                    country representatives, military country representatives, on the military side
                    oftentimes, frequently, most often don't even talk to their ambassadors, so in
                    terms of civil- military relations, getting this link-up in terms of issues if
                    you will, getting the military to focus, the hemispheric body of military guys,
                    to focus on something's that important to their now all democratically elected
                    presidents is, I assume, unattainable - let's just put it that way - for the
                    moment, and I don't see anything changing there in the near term, because I
                    don't see any country that has a need that the board could potentially address,
                    therefore, I don't see the leverage, and some one country or couple of countries
                    have got to see a need strong enough to get things moving, and I don't see it
                    happening, certainly the United states doesn't have one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Haiti. Haiti was a brain issue in the
                        Clinton-Bush campaign of '92, so when Clinton came on board. This was in
                        many ways almost his fist major foreign policy test.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: There was a coup in 1991 in Haiti. The wave of boat peoplexodus of
                    refugees by boats, which most often are not boats at all but rafts of some sort,
                    from Haiti seeking haven in the United Stateshot up dramatically, and that's why
                    it was a campaign issue, that's why it was one of the first, if not the first,
                    foreign policy issue that Clinton had to deal with. The OAS had again that same
                    collection of stars that I had spoke of was at the OAS in '91. They had passed
                    the year before at the highest level of the Foreign Ministry a resolution
                    talking about the democracy being an indispensable part of membership in the
                    OAS, which is nothing new from the charter but it took it several steps further
                    setting a new direction to democracy with grounds for hemispheric action. So
                    this came on the heels of that. That passed in 1990. The coup, if I remember,
                    was in October of '91, and so, a couple of months, the election was not until
                    '92. The election was 1992, so by '92 the OAS after a couple of months been
                    spinning around and trying various high-level missions to areas of Haiti to get
                    the situation reversed, much of the problem in the United States, decided that
                    it would take hemispheric action. They decided to start ratcheting up actions
                    against Haiti in the hopes of reversing and getting the coup guys out quickly.
                    That did work, and so what we saw over the next two or three years, via constant
                    pressure from the United States because of the domestic implication, was a
                    continual ratcheting up of the screws, if you will, tightening the isolation of
                    the leadership in Haiti, and that culminated in 1993 with the imposition of an
                    embargo. If you look at the inter-America behavior of the countries as a group
                    in that process, one has to remember again that, unlike the United Nations where
                    General Assembly decisions were a majority can decide and issue, the OAS works
                    by consensus in the very rare event that the final product, the final decision,
                    is not signed onto by all, and that makes its strength and its weakness. In the
                    case of Haiti the criticism was that what the OAS kept on coming out with what
                    was weaker than what was desirable, but the strength of it at the same time was
                    that, because everybody had signed onto it, everybody, every country, in the
                    hemisphere was prepared to support it, so there was less sort of lip service and
                    more real attention paid to what was agreed to. It didn't stop the exodus of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OAS sent these people down there and talking to the
                        junta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, yes. They were trying on a political level. They were trying to
                    do that sort of thing, high-level missions, not just by the OAS Secretary
                    General but probably more importantly by groups of foreign ministers going down
                    and speaking to them on behalf of the rest of the countries, but the impact was
                    negligible. The embargo people argue even today about the effectiveness of the
                    embargo. I think perhaps the greatest achievement of the embargo was the fact
                    that it permitted the UN to act, and that then having the UN involved in support
                    of the OAS was not only a boost to the OAS, if you will, in that whole Haiti
                    operation, but gave the cover, if you will, or the opening for the United States
                    to go in militarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What really were you getting from those who went to Haiti
                        about the junta in Haiti? Were these people blind or were they cunning
                        or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I don't think they were blind. They knew exactly what they were
                    doing. I think they were extraordinarily cunning, and, very prejudiced now, I'd
                    say that I think they probably epitomize the worst of what you see in many Latin
                    societies, maybe other places as well too but I don't know, that in sort of the
                    absence of any civic mindedness. It was everyone's out for themselves. I don't
                    think they were different from the previous rulers. One subsequent one in
                    manifesting that sort of cultural trait, but I think the means that they used to
                    effect their personal gains were much more vicious certainly than since and
                    probably than before. I think by comparison with the situation now, that might
                    have been a cumulative effect, so after living with the two Duvaliers, Papa Doc
                    and Baby Doc, and having real attention focused on Haiti. You know more about
                    the atrocities of the junta. We hear about them and we heard about them after we
                    had heard about the atrocities of the Duvaliers. They may not have been that
                    much worse but certainly more of the public perception of them was that it was
                    an entirely different order than before. But the OAS tried to send in a human
                    rights monitoring team. If I remember correctly, they did send it in, and that
                    was the only sort of foreign presence. Most other governments left Haiti during
                    the embargo, both for political and practical reasons. It was tough. And the OAS
                    mission monitoring human rights was a very useful source of information and
                    political pressure, but ultimately what changed the situation was the U.S.
                    military intervention. People wondered about that at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The American military, you say. When we put the troops in,
                        what was their immediate reaction at the OAS - oh my God, there go the
                        Americans again, or thank God there go the Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I would say both. Fortunately for the United States, the UN cover
                    made it a non-OAS issue officially because they were going out under UN
                    auspices, not OAS. I think the world, this hemisphere, was tired of Haiti, and
                    Haiti fatigue continued even after that, but I think the Haiti fatigue
                    attenuated everybody's interests. So on the part of the Latins, all right, fine,
                    that's great; they went in and they removed an eyesore, and that's terrific. On
                    the Caribbean side, the Haiti situation affected the Caribbean states much more
                    directly than it affected the Latins just because of proximity. What is not
                    talked about is how many refugees they got and what it did to their economic
                    situation, the other Caribbean countries that were close to Haiti, and what the
                    embargo did to them. So I think there was a bit of happiness that we had done it
                    for them. It was tempered somewhat by the fact it was perfectly obvious that
                    Peru, which was in a similar kind of situation - similar but not identical, of
                    course - was being treated differently by the international system. So I think
                    there was really a mix on the US intervention in Haiti on the part of the
                    hemisphere. What happened in the years thereafter or what didn't happen in the
                    years thereafter has also lacked in experience. What was the point? And yet,
                    political situations don't run themselves generally into a nice and tidy
                    solution.</p>

                    recall, and goes through some of the wildest country in South America that had
                    never really been mapped properly, which was, I think, at the core of the
                    problem, because while it had been this - I think you're right - 1941 agreement
                    that we with three others guaranteed, if you will, guarantee the borders. It had
                    very questionable border demarcation in it. For example, there was one part that
                    went on the watershed of a series of mountains, but the question of what was the
                    watershed had never been resolved. I can remember people just poring over these
                    maps. I mean it seems rather absurd, I mean you're a diplomat and everybody
                    sitting there. Now, who's map do you have? And everybody was figuring out what
                    map are you going to use, and what map you use obviously started off from a
                    different vantage point. It was an interesting exercise in diplomacy. The
                    Ecuadorians kept trying to push this issue into the larger OAS, and that was a
                    very interesting play in terms of the inter-American system where the smaller
                    the country the more benefit accrues to them by the larger, if you will,
                    multilateral studies. The Ecuadorians kept trying to push their position that
                    the guarantor's business did not apply to this and the entire OAS should be
                    involved in the issue. The United States was opposed; Peru was too and ended up
                    staying with the guarantors. Another interesting aspect of that particular
                    problem was the imbalance between Ecuador and Peru on all levels, economically,
                    militarily, politically. Peru, of course, had Fujimori at the helm at that
                    point, and Ecuador had a series of presidents, which made them rather weak in
                    terms of the continuity issue if not the personalities of their presidents. It
                    was a non-typical OAS issue in terms of the seriousness of the issue, the
                    dispute, the different kinds of manifestations it had taken over years and years
                    and years of tension between the countries and the fact that it periodically did
                    erupt into armed conflict. The solution, of course, the immediate solution,
                    which got it out of the OAS and therefore permitted its resolution was to enlist
                    some high-level negotiator to work between the two countries outside of the
                    system completely. And I think that speaks to the weakness of the OAS - unless
                    one were to consider that this whole process of the negotiator having been sort
                    of part of the Inter-American System. I suppose you can make that argument.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: In fact what went into that happening politically and in terms of
                    public relations is that the OAS turned it over to special negotiation process,
                    and at that point it became a bilateral thing. So the OAS was not the one that
                    resolved it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there people there at the OAS who were activists in

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I think the latter. First of all, I don't think most of the OAS
                    cared about the question, thought it was relatively ridiculous, but sympathized
                    with the plight of Ecuador, which is much smaller and was fighting the colossus
                    of Peru, and was on the whole quite happy to get rid of it. It goes back to the
                    people who are representing the countries at the OAS. I don't think most of the
                    folks at the OAS were interested in tackling such a serious issue or had the
                    wherewithal personally to deal with this, much less for the government. So I
                    think everybody was quite happy, and ultimately I think the solution was fine
                    for both countries. I think it was truly one of these good diplomatic solutions,
                    which was arrived at the ultimate resolution of the conflict.</p>

                        yesterday, Fujimori has sort of been an advocate more or less, but how was
                        Fujimori, the President of Peru, seated in the OAS during the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, the OAS witnessed his coming to power and then his sort of
                    reincursion and skirmishes with going over the line of democracy, as the OAS saw
                    it. I think in the beginning, in the early '90s before Fujimori started playing
                    around with democratic foundations in Peru, I think the OAS members looked up to
                    him as sort of the wave of the future, the first of these popular democrats, and
                    gave meaning to the idea of new democracy by and for the people as opposed to
                    democracy just representative of a new forum for old elite. I think that,
                    because of that in part, the treatment of Fujimori was much more delicate than
                    it would have been had it been a Caribbean country that we're talking about in
                    terms of his actions, and that led to some divisiveness between the various
                    groups in the OAS. I think the respect for what he was able to do in Peru in a
                    non-democratic nation with the terrorism and the narcotics was undeniable. I
                    forget to mention a more technical or less political institutions including
                    organizations such as the Human Rights Commission and the Human Rights Court to
                    separate other inter-American entities. The Human Rights Commission was very
                    hard on Fujimori throughout this period, and most countries agreed with the
                    Human Rights Commission reports, and that caused a certain amount of isolation
                    of Peru in the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Peruvian ambassador operate under those
                        circumstances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: [Inaudible.] She was a woman, a woman who had personal contacts with
                    Fujimori, was not a career diplomat extremely effective, very smart and very
                    charming - and, of course, charming is an extremely effective tool in many more
                    male societies, Latin societies in the OAS, and it certainly was one of her
                    great strength. And she was just resolute about getting her way. She was an
                    extremely able, effective spokesperson for Fujimori.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the United States take a particular stand on Fujimori,
                        or were they king of going along with everyone else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, I think in the beginning we were taking a stand on Fujimori
                    and in the beginning the rest of the hemisphere were quite willing to be
                    counted. I'd say the hypocrisy that the Caribbean countries accused the OAS of
                    applied to the United States as well. It may be racially based, as was often the
                    accusation; it may not. It stems from a very practical consideration: for
                    example, isolating Haiti. If you look at the map, it's a fairly easy job
                    compared to isolating Peru when you look at how many countries it borders if you
                    were going to do an embargo. Many people said, “Well, why don't we do an embargo
                    against Peru?” Well, it's just not very practical, quite apart from whatever
                    political or racial prejudice were there. It affects big neighbors, Ecuador,
                    Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile. How do you mount a blockade, an embargo, when
                    you have so many countries with so many borders? That really would require
                    active participation by all those countries to control their borders with Peru.
                    I would venture to say that most of those countries probably don't even know
                    exactly where the borders are. Most of those borders fall in jungle areas, so
                    it's very, very difficult from a practical perspective. The other thing too is
                    on a political level in Peru, Fujimori, was doing some good things. The fact
                    that while he was taking these extra-constitutional, undemocratic actions, the
                    fact is he was having success in controlling the terrorist operation, the
                    Shining Path, and he was having success, and he did over a long period of time,
                    success on the narcotics front is the extent to which it's now rampant in
                    Colombia and not Peru. So the United States that sort of two against one, if you
                    will, in terms of the balance of interest with Fujimori</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Chile and Bolivia? Did that cause any
                        particular problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, yes. Chile-Bolivia is an annual statement about the access to
                    the sea. The statements they have, I believe, that these are serious, compelling
                    issues to both countries, but when it's just sort of a once-a-year operation,
                    one has to wonder whether they haven't decided to live with the status quo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Exactly. These conflicts between Guatemala and Belize were solved in
                    the early '90s, so that was not much of an issue when I was at the OAS. In the
                    '80s, of course, the whole Central America thing for better or for worse, so
                    that OAS was helpful in the resolution of the border disputes between El
                    Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua on the Pacific side of the isthmus. Really the
                    only military conflict that was significant was the one between Ecuador and
                    Peru.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling of almost self satisfaction within the
                        OAS at this time? Before most of Latin America was run by military or
                        quasi-military dictatorships, and all of a sudden you had a pretty
                        democratic period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: The early '90s and mid-'90s were a period of self satisfaction for
                    the OAS. I mean they were all democracies at least in terms of the election of
                    their presidents. Their economies were doing very well, very well, which
                    supported the whole concept or notion that the move to democracy had been a good
                    thing. Their efforts hemispherically in the field were very well regarded. The
                    human rights mission in Haiti with the UN was highly regarded. The
                    demobilization that they did of armed combatants in Central America had been
                    highly regarded, again part of that not in conjunction with the United States.
                    They had set up a sort of reintroduction of military folks into civilian life in
                    Nicaragua, and again that was highly regarded. They had done a peace process in
                    Surinam. They had done many things in different fields, primarily political and
                    political-military, which caused great satisfaction but very little public
                    attention. One of the soul-searchings that went on regularly was how can we do
                    such good things and nobody knows and nobody cares. Never mind. They did very
                    good things. And then I thought all began to sort of wane, and I don't know why.
                    I think they need a little more time to see whether it really waned or it's
                    still alive, but the second half of the '90s seemed to have a waning of the
                    effectiveness and the impact perhaps. Certainly the Human Rights Commission
                    continues to be a very effective and attendant arm. Countries are not supporting
                    it. The Inter-American System was depleting funds. The level of representation
                    seemed to be lower. Perhaps it had to do with some democracy issues. The economy
                    started to stagnate in the late '90s, and I gather that's getting fairly serious
                    now, and maybe that combined with the popular authoritarian leaders. These
                    people need to fix things at home before they can go elsewhere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: No. They were a concern to us, yes, but was it voices of real
                    concern in the OAS; was anything special done? No. Maybe that's true in two
                    years or three years but not while I was involved with the OAS, no. Yes,
                    Colombia would want a resolution to put in when they were talking about security
                    issues, the threat of narco-trafficking. So there was all this verbiage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't pass that off to the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, we worked very closely with a number of officers in the State
                    Department Protocol Office, and the number two there in the Protocol Office was
                    one I dealt with most often, Maria Johnson. I can't recall ever dealing with the
                    police. I think normally the political people dealt with the police, because
                    while the staff of the OAS was controlled by us, they were all beyond reproach
                    as an international organization. Then, of course the missions were credited to
                    the OAS and so the OAS Protocol people would deal through the mission with its
                    political people. It was an interesting situation. I mean one part, knowing from
                    my particular vantage point how many of the people at the OAS in fact were
                    permanent residents and therefore didn't have diplomatic immunity, if not US
                    citizens. Of course, it wasn't in their interest financially to be US citizens,
                    and watching the shenanigans of people retired and tried to show up with these
                    million-dollar retirement accounts, that they accumulated from being in a tax
                    free status, retiring and not wanting to go back to country A, B, C, but rather
                    wanting to have their retirement years here and still shelter their retirement
                    income. It was quite amazing. From the perspective of being the host country of
                    the OAS and seeing these very practical situations, problems, and having to
                    resolve those, it was always interesting to me the vociferousness of anti-US
                    feeling. Criticism of US was so loud and yet, of course, nobody ever wanted to
                    go home, the diplomats, this euphoria. The international civil servants in the
                    Inter-American System that were based here didn't want to go and be assigned,
                    rotated, to Bolivia or Santiago or whatever. They were quite happy living here,
                    and that became a real issue because part of the reason for the rather high pay
                    was the idea that they could be sent by the Secretary General to any country in
                    the hemisphere. Well, of course, none of them wanted to do that. They wanted to
                    live in the United States with their high salary and tax-free status, and yet at
                    the same time their country representatives would be sitting there in the
                    various political or technical forums criticizing the United States. It's always
                    a very interesting sort of contrast. Another interest of mine is the number of -
                    it's a lot; I think there's five or six - Cubans in the US who came after the
                    ascent of Castro and essentially sought refuge here and have been diplomats,
                    including one who is so elderly now but who was the Cuban ambassador in Colombia
                    when Castro was there in 1948 leading demonstrations against the OAS before he
                    ever came to power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Bogot� uprising of April 9, 1948 and the

                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Exactly, and he was spirited out of Colombia by the Cuban ambassador
                    and back to Cuba, and that Cuban ambassador is now still serving at the OAS.
                    There are very interesting historical things from that one mundane job of
                    dealing with the fact that we're the host country for many of these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a hiatus between '95 and '97. What were you up
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I went off to senior seminar from September to June. Of course, many
                    people criticize or praise that depending. I think it has mixed value. I
                    certainly enjoyed my time, but I question the value overall for the State
                    Department. But we had two high points of the year. One was the trip to Alaska,
                    which awoke in me an interest in environmental issues and a connection with
                    political questions, and in fact led to my next assignment. The second issue,
                    since I spent so much time in the southern United States was the whole budget
                    debate. Remember that was the year the budget shut down, federal budget shut
                    down, in the government and such, and the debate over federalism and just what
                    the relative bounds of power between the states and the federal government
                    should be, which was interesting just as sort of a student of the United States
                    and not having didn't pay much attention. But the environment issues we start
                    off on as a country but refer to the states for conservation, if you will, and
                    the need for development on a local or regional level. That got me very
                    interested in environmental issues, and I went back to work at OAS taking up
                    Secretary Christopher's initiative to integrate environmental issues with more
                    traditional foreign policy issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: I did that for about nine months from June of '96 to January '97,
                    when I went back to the mission to the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the environmental side, how effective were we there?
                        Was it hard to raise the consciousness of everyone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, the State Department certainly. I was fascinated by that
                    bureau because, unlike any of the others including Consular Affairs that I had
                    knowledge of, its focus was so much away from the State Department to other
                    agencies of the federal government and to the NGOs, non-governmental
                    organizations, that it was an eye opener for me. Now, I think the State
                    Department sort of coming along in terms of being more open to outside domestic
                    players, but I had never experienced that. That bureau is just wide open to the
                    world outside the State Department and rather closed relative to the world of
                    the State Department. Many of the people in that bureau, most, are not Foreign
                    Service Officers, and that is, of course, part of the problem from the
                    perspective of what my job was. Most of them are civil servants; a lot of them
                    are Ph.D.s in various scientific or medical fields, again quite unlike Foreign
                    Service Officers. Many of them are on detail from other government agencies,
                    technical, scientific, environmental agencies. Some are on detail from
                    organizations, both non-governmental and private companies that are working in
                    the field. There are all kinds of shared resources and arrangements that I had
                    never heard about in other parts of the State Department. The purpose was
                    obviously to get into this group of people, this function in the State
                    Department, people that knew the issues from a technical/scientific perspective.
                    What they hadn't done was get very many people in there that knew how to make
                    things happen on a political level relative to their issues. So, yes, they were
                    effective in the scientific community but they were not effective in the
                    diplomatic community. One of Secretary Christopher's initiatives was to get the
                    two to merge then so that the United States could be more effective politically
                    around the world in dealing with these scientific/environmental issues. That was
                    sort of a two-sided effort, the first part trying to convince people within the
                    Bureau that there was value to dealing with regional bureaus. The other part,
                    for example, was getting the regional bureaus to see that there was some value
                    for them. I remember the greatest success that I had. It was a very discouraging
                    at first; it went along slowly; and it was only before I left that I had my
                    greatest satisfaction - I think it's continued since - with the European Bureau
                    where the Baltic States and EUR's objective adjusted vis-�-vis the Baltic States
                    because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Exactly, exactly. Again, there wasn't much money to throw at all
                    those issues that had come about because of the breakdown of the USSR
                    establishment of these breakaway republics. The idea was that they wanted these
                    countries to share experiences, to band together and help each other out. The
                    United States will help a little, but they said that they could further their
                    objective of getting these three or four countries to coalesce and to follow
                    through. It would make the money go further and it would also provide a bulwark,
                    if you will, against instability in Russia if these little countries were sort
                    of united in terms of what they were doing. After many months of discussing this
                    with them, they finally realized that they could use the nuclear pollution issue
                    as one way of bringing together the countries and cementing their common
                    interest, because they all has the same sort of problem in various degrees with
                    all this military debris, if you will, that the Russians, the Soviets, had left
                    behind and no resources with which to contain possible pollution and radiation
                    from these countries. That was just at the very end. It was extremely satisfying
                    when you actually saw the light bulb go off in these leaders in the European
                    Bureau and they realized that this environmental issue, which US domestic
                    agencies had been harping on, primarily EPA, for months, years, about the
                    seriousness of the problem and the State Department had to take the lead to do
                    something about it. It finally went off like, as I say, this light bulb that
                    they could use this issue and the domestic agencies' interest in working on this
                    issue and putting resources in it to further their own political objectives
                    vis-�-vis that area. I suppose other things must have happened, but to me that
                    was a prime breakthrough in great force, unlike most of my career where things
                    just take so long that you're not there to sort of see the breakthrough and you
                    might read about it later on and think about you had some small part in the
                    outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you back to the OAS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Well, my successor died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. Who was your successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Bill Taylor, a consular officer. He came back from Guatemala, where
                    he had been DCM, in the summer of '95 and developed lung cancer after six months
                    or a year and died in January of '97. So the ambassador called me up and
                    said...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: The ambassador was Thomas Hadibaba, who had been ambassador when I
                    left, and so asked me to come back because they were in the middle of some
                    fairly technical negotiations that they hoped to conclude by the OAS' General
                    Assembly date, which was always the first week of June. So I went back. I left
                    my environmental job and went back there and stayed there for about a year and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>Then I went as executive director on detail, as executive director for
                    Pan-American Development Foundation (PDF). One of the things, other than just
                    serving in the usual sort of DCM capacity again, one of the things I did during
                    that second stint in the mission was that I headed up the US follow-up to the
                    Santa Cruz Summit that took place in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. This had been a
                    meeting that was very important to the country and particularly Gore on the
                    Clinton administration, particularly Gore. It had taken place in 1996, and I
                    think was supposed to sort of undo the tarnished US image left over from the Rio
                    Conference...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on environmental matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Exactly, and so this was like a shine-up image, exactly, vis-�-vis
                    at least the inter-American hemisphere. Gore took a personal interest in it
                    because of his image of being a environmental guy, but the interesting thing
                    about that was that I was sort of trying to coordinate the US effort vis-�-vis
                    this thing and also heading up the OAS committee process that was trying to come
                    up with hemispheric positions. The interesting thing about that was how little
                    anybody cared - again, a lesson in the question of expediency on political
                    levels, because areas that seemed so important back in 1996 when the actual
                    conference was held, and here we were in '97 trying to do a follow-up which
                    everybody called for in '96 and was now beginning in 1998, I guess it was, and
                    nobody cared, including the United States. But everybody wanted to have this
                    conference, at least on paper, they wanted to have this meeting to sort of
                    assess what progress had been made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on environmental matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, environmental matters. I will just move on from there. So I
                    went off on detail to Pan-American Development Foundation, which is associated
                    with the OAS in that it receives a small annual subsidy, and its mission is to
                    sort of do development work and carry out policies of the OAS as a
                    non-government entity based in Washington. It has its board of directors as a
                    private entity. For many years it had paid no attention to the OAS in any way
                    except for taking its money, and now it's hard up for money as are many NGOs and
                    so they wanted to pay more attention to the OAS and hopefully get some more
                    money out of there. I guess it was not a very satisfactory arrangement. The main
                    thing, I think, of significance in the hemisphere was the whole question of
                    Hurricane Mitch and now we responded. As you know, that hurricane took place
                    probably about October, September or October, of '98.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was horrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Horrible. The hurricane just sort of stopped over Honduras, the
                    northern part of Nicaragua for four or five days. I was in Nicaragua at the
                    beginning of the hurricane and fortunately was sick and so decided to get out,
                    because when you're sick you don't want to be in a hotel room. But even then -
                    that was the first day of the hurricane - the flights were being canceled. I had
                    to go down to Panama in order to get back up to the United States. So I was very
                    grateful that I had gotten out. It would have been maybe ten days because roads,
                    airports were washed out and non-functioning at least for weeks and months
                    thereafter. But at PDF it was an interesting vantage point from which to view
                    hemispheric reaction. The OAS issued its usual pronouncement, typically wordy
                    and absent of significance in terms of providing material. I suppose that's
                    harsh, but the fact is there. At PDF we took a leadership role and were very
                    successful in raising funds in the community here in Washington and than
                    channeling those monies down. It offered an opportunity for the OAS to really
                    get private sector funding in the US, and perhaps it will lead to that down the
                    road, which might help in larger terms the development of the country, but
                    that's a long way away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Panama Development get involved in Hurricane
                        Mitch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Oh, you mean PDF?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: We had a couple of operations going already so we had contact, and
                    we used the OAS offices in the region. One of our programs was getting used
                    equipment, office equipment and hospital equipment, and refurbishing it and
                    sending it to clinics in the region. That was a very successful program. We used
                    the infrastructure for that program to collect household items, building
                    supplies, used clothing, of course, which I think was of moderate utility, and
                    sent containers to Honduras and Nicaragua with those items to help in the
                    immediate aftermath and then help with the building, and we got local businesses
                    in the DC and Baltimore area to finance cash or finance containers or finance
                    building materials. We had radio-thons and I did radio interviews and callers
                    would send checks. Again, it was a very unusual experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Foundation was able to push the

                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, in terms of the immediate aftermath. Of course, the Foundation
                    could not begin to touch the scale of what was needed. You mentioned the word
                    'promptness', and that was one of the great criticisms of the response to the
                    hurricane with the length of time it took, not only in the immediate aftermath,
                    immediate emergency assistance, but also in terms of the international
                    community, the pace set by international financial institutions to review the
                    situation and make loans, grants, whatever, available. The protests in Seattle
                    at the WTO (World Trade Organization).</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Yes, but those sorts of issues - at the International Monetary Fund
                    meeting this year in the spring, the same sort of protest about the lack of
                    responsiveness to the needs of the developing world. The reaction to government
                    and quasi-governmental responses after Hurricane Mitch was along the lines of
                    what was heard around the United States about President Bush at those meetings.
                    I'm certainly not an authority to know how one faces those problems of response
                    time, because so much depends on the country's or somebody's assessment of need
                    and identification, sort of breaking the need down into manageable chunks and
                    putting it into the broader context.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HORSEY-BARR: Right. What the solution was I don't know, but certainly what I did
                    witness was the unhappiness of the hopeful civilians in both the quantity and
                    the timeliness.</p>

                    retired at the end of November '99, and so there we are. I'm retired and
                    happy.</p>
