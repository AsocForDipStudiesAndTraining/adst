                <p>Interviewer: Harold Davey </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 19, 1993</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 19, 1993, and I am Harold Davey interviewing
                        George L. P. Weaver for the Labor Diplomacy Oral History Project. Now, this
                        oral history program is targeted principally to young graduate students,
                        George, not yet very familiar with the operational and political aspects of
                        U.S. diplomacy in the post-World War II period. These stories and examples
                        of how personalities or policy directives work can serve as excellent
                        guidelines, which may encourage the tendency toward the formation of future
                        model approaches. It is not a discussion of what we should have done nor
                        does it tend to stress whether our current policies are right or wrong,
                        rather it is an account of how you felt at the time and how you then saw the
                        situation. So the first question I want to raise with you is your personal
                        interest in labor and foreign affairs and your pre-Foreign Service concerns
                        and involvement. When did you first get interested in labor and the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WEAVER: Well, I was with the labor movement and served as assistant to Jim Carey,
                    who was Secretary-Treasurer of the CIO. Jim handled [international policy]. Phil
                    Murray used to jokingly introduce Jim sometimes at the CIO Board meetings as his
                    Foreign Minister, because he handled the international aspects, which as you
                    compare them with today were slight in comparison, but very important to us in
                    those days. He handled international affairs for the CIO, and as his assistant I
                    got became involved quite often in providing research for him and backstopping
                    him at meetings and that sort of thing, so I became interested in foreign
                    affairs early on. I went on the staff of the CIO in 1942, and shortly thereafter
                    there was a tin strike and then a massacre of tin workers in Bolivia. That
                    incident received a good deal of publicity here in the United States. The labor
                    movement here picked it up, passed resolutions, and went as far as seeing the
                    President of the United States. The President sent a team down, which included a
                    representative from the CIO. If I remember it correctly — I would have to check
                    this name — I think it was Martin Kyne from the Wholesale and Retail Workers
                    [Union]. This team was directed by the President to report to Sumner Wells, who
                    was an Under Secretary of State, and who had very close contact with the
                    President. I think they were in school together, but their friendship and their
                    working together went back many years before Roosevelt became President. Out of
                    that incident and the experience that followed the incident, the Labor Attach�
                    Program developed. It grew out of that program. So my interest goes back to the
                    very beginning of the Labor Attach� Program, and as I say, I was assistant to
                    Jim Carey, and Jim had a very heavy involvement in the foreign affairs of the
                    period, development of the Marshall Plan, and he was involved in the various
                    committees that the President appointed to flesh out and develop the Marshall
                    Plan. As his assistant, I accompanied him to any number of meetings; At some I
                    represented him when he was not able to attend himself. So I had an interest in
                    international affairs which goes back to the 1940's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so that's the beginning of your interest, and then
                        in the period before you came to the Labor Department in 1961, you had some
                        more involvement in international affairs throughout, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WEAVER: Well, yes. I really was inducted into the international community in 1950
                    and 1951, just as we got involved in the Korean War. I was loaned to Stuart
                    Symington, who was at that time Administrator of the NSRB, the National Security
                    and Resources Board. The NSRB was a planning agency of the U.S. Government and a
                    sister agency to what is now NSA [National Security Agency]. It was created at
                    the same time. Its responsibility was to develop an inventory of our resources
                    and to plan for future wars. I served with Stuart Symington there as one of his
                    assistants. Then in 1951 when the scandals broke in the RFC, President Truman
                    appointed Symington to clean up the RFC. It really was the sum and substance of
                    the charge to him, and I was one of six assistants that Stuart had at the . . It
                    was the NSRB, the National Resources and Security Board. That's what it was. And
                    I accompanied him and moved over to the R.F.C.During World War II, the R.F.C.
                    was given the responsibility of overseeing our tin purchases. We didn't produce
                    any tin. We purchased all of our tin from overseas, which was sharply affected
                    by World War II. The other commodity was abaca or hemp; we also imported all of
                    it. Well, we started hemp plantations in Central America, and before the war was
                    over, we were fulfilling our supply needs on that. We leaned heavily on the tin
                    that we bought from Bolivia, which was the major source in this hemisphere, and
                    we built a smelter in Texas City, Texas, which at that time was the [world's]
                    most modern smelter, to handle primarily the Bolivian tin, which was of a lower
                    grade than the tin from either Nigeria or Malaysia. We bought tin in Malaysia,
                    in Indonesia and in Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be World War II then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WEAVER: No, this was the Korean War. When we took over the R.F.C., we were buying
                    tin at that time . . . The tin price had gone up to $1.70 or $1.80 a pound, and
                    there was tin reputedly being held out in Europe waiting for a $4.00 a pound
                    price. There was quite an outcry here, particularly from the steel industry,
                    which was the largest user of tin, used in tin cans. After a series of
                    conversations internally within the Government, it was decided, largely at
                    Stuart Symington's urging, and finally agreed to by George Marshall, who was
                    Secretary of Defense at that time — and they had charge of the Munitions Board,
                    which tin came under, because during the war it was a vital metal — that we get
                    out of the tin market and drew down tin from the National Stock Pile. That was
                    the reason you had to have Marshall's agreement, because the Munitions' Board
                    had the jurisdiction over the stock pile. This action caused a virtual
                    revolution in Latin America, in Bolivia particularly and in Asia. Churchill at
                    that time was the [British] Prime Minister, and you could here him squawking all
                    over the world, because at that time Malaysia was in the midst of the guerrilla
                    warfare, and just in the process of moving from colonies into independent
                    territories, then into full independence. A lot of heat developed immediately
                    for us to move away from this boycott, which was literally what it was. We just
                    withdrew from the market. It was really a boycott. But to make a long story
                    short, I was appointed by Symington as a member of the team that had the
                    responsibility of renegotiating our tin contracts, and in that assignment, I
                    traveled to Bolivia two or three times that summer, the summer of 1951. Then
                    around November it was — because we spent Thanksgiving out there — we made a
                    swing out to the Far East and that was my introduction to the Far East, a
                    section of the world that I later spent a lot of time in. Subsequently when I
                    left the Government and returned to the labor movement, I was loaned to the
                    ICFTU, and then later as a Government official, I spent a good deal of time in
                    Asia because of the War in Vietnam. So this is how I sort of slid into my
                    interest in labor and foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were with the ICFTU, where was your home
                        base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I was still based here {in Washington], but I worked out of the Singapore
                    office. I had an apartment out there, but I never left the payroll of the
                    AFL-CIO. I was on the AFL- CIO payroll, and the ICFTU provided expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had contact, I suppose, with Labor Attach�s then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, yes. I always touched base with Labor Attach�s first. Skagen was our
                    Labor Attach� in Tokyo. I went out to Tokyo as head of an ICFTU mission to
                    investigate labor and social conditions in Okinawa, and I was elected Chairman
                    of the mission. Skagen from the Machinists was the Labor Attach� in Tokyo at
                    that time. There wasn't a Labor Attach� in Singapore or Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
                    but I maintained very close contact with the Consulates General in both
                    Singapore and Malaysia. In those days it was just a Consulate General. It became
                    an Embassy in Malaysia and then subsequently in Singapore after they gained
                    their independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see that around 1955, Irv Lippe became the Labor Attach�
                        in Singapore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, in Singapore, but then he moved up to Malaysia and worked out of
                    Malaysia. I was out there when Irv came out. That was where I first met Irv. Irv
                    came into the program from the Teamsters, and we had met one another casually
                    when he was with the Teamsters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a lot of contact through the ICFTU Your base
                        union was the IUE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, my base union was IUE. Well, my first base union in the labor
                    movement was with the United Transport Workers' Union as a red cap. Then I went
                    on the staff of the CIO, and I got involved in the organization of the IUE when
                    it was chartered in 1949 as result of the expulsion of the UE from the CIO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, and Jim Carey, of course, who had been the President of the old UE
                    headed up the effort to organize the IUE, and, of course, being one of his
                    assistants, I worked with him. When I left the staff of the AFL-CIO and went
                    back with the IUE, I became the Director of Political Education and the
                    International Program. I was holding those two posts down when I came back into
                    Government as Assistant Secretary of Labor for International Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you still had a relationship with Senator
                        Symington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I maintained a relationship with Senator Symington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which had an effect on your appointment, did it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WEAVER: No, the appointment came about [as follows:] Arthur Goldberg and I had
                    worked very closely together in the labor movement, in the CIO. One of my
                    functions in the CIO was as Director of the Civil Rights Department, and we had
                    a Civil Rights Committee, which Goldberg served on as Counsel to the Committee
                    and a member of the Committee. My relationship with Goldberg went back to 1948,
                    when he first came to Washington as Counsel for the Steel Workers' Union and the
                    CIO, so when he was appointed by President Kennedy, he asked me to serve with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how you became Assistant Secretary. Through
                        Goldberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes. But I maintained a very close contact and friendship with Symington
                    up until the day of his death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served under two President, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon
                        Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: And Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First with Kennedy, did you have some personal contact
                        with President Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of those dealing with the Labor Attach� Corps? Or
                        were they just n general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, each one of the contacts I had with the President, each time I saw
                    him dealt with some aspect of the ILAB [Bureau of International Labor Affairs,
                    U.S. Department of Labor] program. The last time was just a month to the day
                    before his assassination. I took Dave Morse, who was Director General of the
                    ILO, in to see him. Of course I represented the Government on the Governing Body
                    of the ILO and led the delegations to the annual conference. One other time I
                    went in to see the President and spent about 45 minutes with him; I was with
                    George Meany and Arthur Goldberg. It was just before Goldberg was appointed to
                    the Supreme Court. We were working on the Alliance for Progress Program. Part of
                    the program that we worked out that day with the President was for him to
                    receive a group of trade unionists from Latin America, who were involved with
                    the Alliance for Progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we have a picture of that. Joaquin Bazan is in the
                        picture with the Latin American trade unionists and President Kennedy
                        meeting at the White House. It must have been that meeting probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I didn't remember that there were any pictures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That one [with Joaquin Bazan] I have. I'll have to show it
                        to you. So that was your meetings with Kennedy dealing with the ILO and with
                        the Alliance for Progress. Now, in your relations with President Lyndon
                        Johnson, did you have anything in your contacts dealing with the Labor
                        Attach� Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Not with the Labor Attach� Corps as such. I knew President Johnson since
                    before he became the Majority Leader in the Senate, and my contacts with him
                    were more political than they were dealing with the labor program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I know that some of the Secretaries of Labor got
                        directly involved in the Labor Attach� issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: When I was Assistant Secretary, I involved the Secretaries every
                    opportunity that I had, because quite often problems arose that could be quickly
                    and quietly settled at the Secretary level at Cabinet meetings or by picking up
                    the telephone and calling his colleague. So I kept them closely involved. It was
                    easy to do, because I kept the Secretary and his [immediate staff] involved
                    through his staff meetings. We had two a week, and the Secretary always went
                    around the table, and so you had an opportunity to involve not only the
                    Secretary but the Under Secretary and the Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So both Secretary Goldberg and Secretary Wirtz were
                        involved in the same way..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: And we had another program that was of inestimable value, and that was
                    the American-Japanese Cabinet Committee. I represented the Secretary in that
                    operation, and he had an opportunity, particularly going to Japan, to see the
                    Labor Attach� in operation. Our Labor Attach� — I'm trying to think of his name
                    now. —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: In Japan in the 1960's.</p>

                <p>WEAVER: Lou Silverberg. Lou made quite an impression on both Goldberg and Wirtz.
                    Any time that the Secretary was going out of the country, I always arranged for
                    him to meet with the Labor Attach�s, and generally arranged for the Labor
                    Attach�s to meet him and to arrange sessions with them. It was to their [mutual]
                    advantage, I thought, both educating the Secretary as well as developing
                    powerful friends for the program, to keep the Secretary involved as much as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were, of course, supportive. Now, Phil Delaney .
                        . . I guess when you first came on board, it wasn't Phil Delaney; it was
                        another man from California from a public sector union who was S/IL, the
                        first S/IL under President Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Gordon Chapman. You see Gordon and I had been the two American
                    representatives on the committee in Okinawa. We had been on that mission
                    together, so I knew Gordon well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Gordon came out to Rome for that Labor Attach�
                        Conference as kind of his first official act. So you had good relations with
                        the State Department when Gordon Chapman was S/IL?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Very good relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then he was there for only about a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: About a year or a year and a half. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Phil Delaney took over S/IL?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: That's right. Phil succeeded him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your relations with the State Department through
                        Phil Delaney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Put it this way, my relations with the State Department remained good. My
                    relationship with S/IL began to deteriorate. In those days, I served on a
                    Foreign Service Board, which was largely made up of Assistant Secretaries. I
                    don't know whether it is still important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There still is a Board of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WEAVER: And I served on it, and it had tremendous influence. In fact, it had
                    responsibility for the development of the Labor Attach� Program. Another aspect
                    of the Labor Attach� Program I looked on with great importance was the Promotion
                    Boards. I saw to it every year that we manned each one of the Boards for each
                    grade, and this brought me in touch with other officers in the Department [of
                    State] all the way up to the Assistant Secretary level. So although my personal
                    relationships with S/IL deteriorated . . . — Other colleagues in the ILAB were
                    able to maintain relationships. — . . . my relationships with other parts of the
                    State Department didn't suffer at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I guess this relationship with S/IL would impact on
                        things like recruiting of Labor Attach�s and their assignments, for
                        example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Well, it didn't so much on assignments because I still . . . Well, I'll
                    put it this way. There was a large group in the State Department who were
                    sympathetic to the Labor Attach� Program, but resisted and some resented the way
                    that S/IL functioned. The fact that S/IL was looked upon by many in the
                    Department as responsible, as they used to say, to “15th Street” [the AFL-CIO]
                    rather than to the Secretary of State was resented and, of course, many of them
                    also knew my personal relationships, and they took advantage of the situation. I
                    knew the game that they were playing, so this became a part of the daily diet in
                    relation to the dealings with S/IL.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the CIO versus AFL origin of these Labor Attach�s
                        continue to be a factor in their assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes. Yes. Yes. Of course, nobody would admit it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since you were from the CIO and Phil was from the AFL . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Well, there was something deeper than that. I never talked about this too
                    much, but those who were active at that point, and a good many of the men are
                    still living, knew about it. Phil was a candidate for the job that I got as
                    Assistant Secretary, and they went to great lengths trying to block [my
                    appointment]. Goldberg had invited me to join him and I agreed to it, and he
                    refused to back down, but they went as far as to try to involve Walter Reuther
                    in putting up and supporting another candidate. Phil was one of the candidates
                    for that job, and this also was a factor, I think, in subsequent
                    relationships.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about McCarthyism, for example? Did you see that in
                        any of the issues involving Labor Attach�s, in their assignments or maybe
                        being up for discharge due to alleged Communist connections during the
                        McCarthyism period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, remember the McCarthyism period was coming to an end during our
                    [tenure].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be more while you were with the CIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, that was quite . . . Well, when I was in Government before with
                    Symington, it was at its height. I remember Symington used to call my wife and
                    me each evening during the McCarthy hearings. You'll remember Symington was on
                    that committee. He and McCarthy almost came to blows. We used to talk for hours
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, but it did not affect the Labor Attach� Program. First of all, the
                    Labor Attach� Program was not as important and not as influential in the 1950's
                    as it was in the 1960's. The cast of characters in State Department as well as
                    in the White House changed significantly in the 1960's. If you remember, there
                    was vacillation on the part Eisenhower himself and vacillation on the part of
                    Dulles with unfortunate and unfavorable consequences on many of the staff
                    officers. There was no question about where Kennedy stood, nor where Rusk
                    stood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I think you are right that by the time the
                        Administration changed, but I guess there were some Labor Attach�s . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: And the climate of opinion had changed too. You see, the Labor Attach�
                    Program was not a factor. It was during the height of the McCarthy period, which
                    would be in the early 1950's. The Labor Attach� Program was just really getting
                    started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relations with Ambassadors that you worked
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WEAVER: My relationship with the ambassadors was uniformly good. One of the
                    routine briefings for ambassadors was a visit to the Labor Department, and we
                    took it very seriously. I always arranged for them to see and spend a few
                    minutes with the Secretary [of Labor], and I would spend all of the time that
                    they had and make available to them any aspect of the program they were
                    interested in. I'd bring our top people in to talk with them. So generally we
                    started out with having made a reasonably favorable impression, and that I would
                    follow up on as soon as I was in the field. Any time I was in the field, I
                    always secured the permission of the Ambassador, if I was coming to his country.
                    I always sounded it out and got a green light from the State Department, before
                    I made travel plans and publicized what country I was going to. The only
                    exception was Geneva, where I was going three or four times a year. This was an
                    aspect of the program that I nursed very carefully, so I never had any
                    difficulty that I can think of off hand. I never had any difficulty with any of
                    the Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have occasion to contact them about say a Labor

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, yes, and when problems would arise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of problem might arise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Well, there were a couple . . . I don't remember off hand the names. A
                    couple Labor Attach�s we had to get out of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one problem I think you had was the situation in
                        Pakistan with Herb Baker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, but the way we handled that . . . We thought Herb was right, and we
                    saw to it that he got a better post, because what we were trying to demonstrate
                    to the Corps was that they would not be punished when they were right. In fact,
                    we tried to suddenly reward him and that was known in the State Department.
                    Crockett jumped me about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sent him I believe to Tel Aviv, which was a better
                        post. As I understand it, the difficulty in Pakistan was with a Chinese
                        Communist official at a meeting — and this of course was 1962 or so — and
                        Herb Baker did not want to be associated on the platform with this person,
                        and he left the meeting. The Ambassador said, “Well, next time you stay and
                        don't walk off. It creates bad publicity.” Herb said, “Put that in writing.”
                        And the Ambassador said, “Send him home immediately, because he thinks I
                        will not live up to my word.” The Ambassador got rid of him in 24
                        hours.</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, that was Abe Kramer in Germany, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And why did the Ambassador want him to leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: It was differences in reporting, and as a result we sent Abe to . . . Abe
                    had had difficulty before. This was before I came on board. And we sent him to
                    Singapore as a Regional [Labor Attach�].</p>

                <p>WEAVER: He did extremely well out there. He was grateful to me up to the day he
                    died. I went to see him the day before he died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were a couple of incidents there. In the one case
                        the Ambassador in Pakistan was not too helpful, but there was a problem
                        which had to be resolved, and you resolved it in that way. What about your
                        relations with the Agency for International Development (AID)? I know there
                        are a lot of things that you have done in the AID area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: The relationship was very good with AID, and we worked out — and this was
                    largely the ground work, which was worked out at my level, and the details were
                    worked out of course with the technicians, and that was the program that Jim
                    Taylor [worked on]. — the DOLITAC Program. And after the DOLITAC Program was
                    worked out, then we had a formal mechanism, which meant just daily working at it
                    and implementing. Jim did an excellent job. He sort of lived in that DOLITAC
                    [office]. Jim had one habit that I used to chuckle about. I always tried to
                    accept it with a straight face, but Jim could bring you notebooks . . . You
                    asked him a question and you really got the answer and all of the precedents and
                    all of the mousetraps that he could conceive of. I used to laugh about it,
                    because I was fearful of trying to choke it off.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you had these difficulties with S/IL Phil Delaney,
                        what about your relations with the AFL-CIO International Affairs Department
                        or George Meany himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I had a peculiar and interesting relationship. George Meany and I
                    differed and differed sharply. I was the first staff person of the AFL-CIO to
                    resign after the merger, and Meany tried to talk me out of it. When he and Jim
                    Carey broke over the Civil Rights Committee . . . See Meany didn't know really
                    what to do with me. When the merger took place, the only black on his staff of
                    the AFL was the elevator operator. The first three or four years I spent most of
                    my time out of the country, out in Asia on loan to the ICFTU, and I came back
                    and he and Jim got into a shouting match, and Jim resigned as Chairman of the
                    Civil Rights Committee. I resigned the next day, and I told Meany we don't want
                    to talk about it, and I think he understood that my loyalty was with Jim Carey.
                    I grew up under Jim. I owed much to him, and I was sure that he understood.
                    That's the way I left it. Well, we differed strongly, and largely I thought
                    because of Delaney's influence. We differed strongly on the ILO. Delaney had
                    strong, sharp beliefs on how the delegation should be run, what the United
                    States' posture should be, particularly on political issues. I had a different
                    approach and different idea, and I had the responsibility. I was never scared,
                    because Delaney used to scare the hell out of most people by what George Meany
                    thought and what he was going to do, but that never influenced me, and he knew
                    it. Well, we had eight years of sort of armed neutrality.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess it was more like six and a half. With Gordon
                        [Chapman]. . . Oh, you and George Meany had that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, Delaney and I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess Delaney at first was in ILAB.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, he was in ILAB.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was Director of the Office of Foreign Relations,
                        so he was your subordinate.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, but that still didn't make any difference, because he was running
                    back and forth over to [Meany]. Meany and I had respect on both sides, and Meany
                    was very kind. He had very kind words to say when I left the Labor Department
                    and when I left the ILO. You see Meany and Dave Morse fought, and I ended up
                    supporting Dave Morse most of the time. Then when Morse put me on the staff, he
                    did not consult with Meany. He made me Director of the Washington Office, and
                    Meany was furious about that. Here again, I knew what the result was going to
                    be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Well, if a Labor Attach� assignment came up that
                        was at controversy between you and Phil Delaney, would you get involved with
                        the AFL-CIO about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Sometimes. It was according to who the person was and according to how
                    important the post was, and if it was a real important post, I would. For
                    example, the reason that Tom Bowie stayed in Rome for as long as he did was
                    because Phil and I differed on who [would replace him].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: And I agreed we would leave Bowie there. Now I didn't do that through
                    Meany. I did that through Jay Lovestone. You see, I had an interesting
                    relationship with Jay. There was mutual respect there. Jay and I used to . . .
                    just like what's his name who was in Paris, Irving Brown. Irving and I, we
                    always had a good working relationship and understood one another. Irving used
                    to come to me on the Q.T., when he was labor representative to the ILO, and I
                    was on the ILO staff. He would come to me about working out the relationships
                    about the labor movement coming back. I can't remember and pinpoint an issue
                    where my differences with Meany had a deleterious effect on the [Labor] Attach�
                    Program.</p>

                <p>WEAVER: Oh, he was a good staffer. I didn't know that much about him. Where is he

                <p>WEAVER: No, I can't say that I had a relationship with him. I followed his work,

                    came out of the CIO. Let me look down this list. It will remind me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's only a list of those with five or more assignments.
                        There may be others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Bob Kinney was one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was with the CIO, and you pushed or encouraged him to
                        get into Labor Attach� work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who did you nominate him to at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: At that time we went directly to Bob Murphy through Jim Carey. Then I got
                    to know Murphy very well too.</p>

                <p>WEAVER: Wilbur Wright? Let me see that list, and I can go over the list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, Wilbur Wright was in ILAB, and didn't you
                        nominate him for Labor Attach� somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Labor Attach�, yes.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Howard Robinson is another. Sandman was one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lennie Sandman. Yes, Lennie came to the Labor Department
                        from the AFL, as he was recounting at the luncheon the other day [of former

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boggs would be after the merger while you were in ILAB, so

                <p>WEAVER: Lovestone, yes. I'm looking over these names here.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's continue with my alphabetical questioning of
                        you and they might come up if you had anything to do with [their entry]. I
                        think I see one down the list here that you did. Your relation with Tom
                        Byrne, who was the Labor Attach� in Ghana and the U.K.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes. I really think that Tom was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had good relations with Tom Byrne, but he came into
                        the Labor Attach� Program before you were in ILAB. Did you have anything to
                        do with his recruitment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, I knew him though, before he came in. No, I didn't have anything to
                    do with his recruitment</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now he was in the U.K. in 1964, in London. Did you have
                        contact with him there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I had a good deal of contact with him, and it was all on the
                    favorable side. Q: And what was the sort of thing that you would deal with him
                    about?</p>
                <p>WEAVER: Well, I dealt with him about questions in regard to the British labor
                    movement, and particularly important, I was in and out of London on the way to
                    the ILO. We worked very closely with the British delegate representative on the
                    ILO Governing Body, and he would set up meetings for us and that sort of
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then Seymour Chalfin was already in the Foreign Service
                        when you came to ILAB, but he went on and was assigned to Kenya and the OECD
                        in France. Did you have any work with Sy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, when he was in France, I used to see him. He used to arrange
                    meetings for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about Herman Cohen, who was Labor Attach� in
                        Southern Rhodesia and Zaire back in the 1960's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, but I didn't have any particular dealings with him [then]. I had more
                    dealings with him after he became Ambassador, and I was with the ILO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Condon served in Tunisia and Algeria and Vietnam and
                        Lebanon while you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I had a lot of contact with him. He served in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was after you were in ILAB, but you were still
                        working with the ILO then. Yes, he was Labor Attach� in France in 1970.
                        Vietnam, that must have been a tough period. Did you have any particular
                        programs with him in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Not when he was in Vietnam, no I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now he was in Lebanon in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes. He succeeded Harold [Snell], I think, in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I believe he did. There were four Labor Attach�s
                        there, Jim Mattson and he and Dick Searing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, but I think he succeeded Harold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we have it right here in our list. Lebanon. Condon
                        succeeded Snell, and he was succeeded by Searing, and he was succeeded by
                        Mattson. Of course Harold continued to serve there for quite a few years
                        after his initial appointment. It was about nine years, I think, Harold was
                        Labor Attach� there. He was one of the longest serving Labor Attach�s
                        anywhere.</hi>

                <p>WEAVER: No, I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you mentioned John Doherty, who was an Assistant Labor

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: We had difficulty finding a post for John because of housing. Remember
                    the housing needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he had about nine children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, eight or nine children at one point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, I guess these were posts that could take him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: You know the problem was that the big house were for grades higher than
                    he was. You know, for the Counselor of Embassy or the D.C.M..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They get the big houses. I think his first job was as
                        Assistant Labor Attach�. Now, jumping ahead to one of his bosses, Irving
                        Salert. Do you recall any relations that you had with Irving Salert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Sure, Irving. I had a lot of relations with Irving. I was trying to think
                    where Irving was serving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Mexico was one [place].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Irving came out of the labor movement. He came out of the America (?)
                    side. He was also with the Community Services Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall hearing about one incident involving John Doherty
                        and Salert, and another one involving I think Ed Sylvester and Salert.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>WEAVER: What? I don't remember what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, you sent Ed down to be your representative at
                        one of these USIA trade fair things, and Salert didn't give him the time of
                        day, because who was Ed Sylvester? Some junior person, he thought. And I
                        think he kind of snubbed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: That's like Salert. That's the wrong person to snub, and I bet Ed made
                    him pay for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I have the impression that on the next couple of
                        Selection Boards he didn't do too well, but also speaking of Salert, there
                        were three Assistant Labor Attach�s there in a row that he gave a very rough
                        time to, one was Tyler Byrne, John Doherty, and the other I think was [James
                        Creagan]. He wrote very bad efficiency reports on all of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: He was no good. What ever happened to him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. I don't know about him. Now, Jim Engle was
                        Labor Attach� in Germany in 1961. Did you have any contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No. Not [really].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Jim Taylor used to have a lot of problem with that,
                        because he was an FSO and this was a job that we had always had labor people
                        in. Now Cliff Finch was in Spain and Vietnam and other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I knew Cliff very well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, he arranged meetings, and he was an excellent briefer. Cliff was a
                    very good reporter. Now his judgment at times left a lot to be desired, but he
                    was an excellent reporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Judgment about what issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: On things he reported on. I mean the conclusions that he would draw, but
                    he was an excellent reporter in terms of getting the facts. But I soon learned
                    how to handle and what to do with him. And I liked him very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, John Fishburn was in Geneva, and you dealt with him

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I dealt with him extensively.</p>

                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I know he is retired. I was wondering where.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember I think an incident about him in Brazil while I

                        annual labor report, the Embassy did not accept what he wrote, and he sort
                        of sent it in as a dissent message.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: That's like him.</p>
                <p>

                        view. Then later on he got assigned to Geneva. Now young Tony Freeman was in

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has had some very top jobs in the State Department in
                        Latin America since then. Let's see, Dale Good we talked about. He was in
                        Israel, in Austria, then in Germany right at the end of your tour. Did you
                        have much contact with Dale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I had a good deal of contact with Dale. Dale succeeded Phil [Delaney as

                <p>WEAVER: What had happened to Dale? Where did Dale go?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he did succeed Phil. I think Dan Horowitz succeeded
                        Phil more directly, didn't he? Thinking back to what is the chronology of
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: He was before Phil, wasn't he? No, no, Dan was after.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I was trying to think where Dale fitted in. Or [maybe] Dale was Assistant

                        Horowitz was brought in to be S/IL, and that may have been a little later
                        period though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: When did Byrne become Ambassador?</p>

                        he was Ambassador in Norway when . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Was it Norway or . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Norway, and then Czechoslovakia. I think it was Norway,
                        because he received the Nobel Prize for Kissinger. When Kissinger got the
                        Nobel Prize, Byrne was the American Ambassador to Norway. There's a picture
                        of him in a tuxedo receiving this award on behalf of Kissinger, so that
                        would have been some time after Vietnam. Well, in any event, Dale Good would
                        be more after your period in ILAB that he was in S/IL. He was a counterpart
                        to Howard Samuel, and Howard Samuel was Deputy Under Secretary or the
                        equivalent to your job under the Carter Administration, which would be 1977
                        to 1980. So that was when Dale Good was S/IL, about that period. A little
                        later.</hi>

                <p>Now, Dan Goott was out in France in 1962.</p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, that was sort of his swan song.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No. I had a couple meals with him when I was over there, but not any

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: In Argentina is where I met him. I went down to Argentina to an ILO

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, but before that he was the Latin American person in the State

                <p>WEAVER: I knew him when he went in, and we okayed him going into Trinidad.</p>

                <p>WEAVER: Yes, that's when he came in. I was trying to think where he came from. I
                    know his father was active in the Sleeping Car Porters' Union, and I am trying
                    to think where Charlie was.</p>

                <p>WEAVER: But his case came up before the Secretary's staff meeting, and I remember
                    Leo Wertz joined me in strongly arguing that we should take him back because it
                    came during a time when we were tight on personnel and we had to find a job for

                <p>Now we talked about Bob Kinney. In addition to being in Malaysia, he was also in

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was Labor Attach� there in 1953. So it would have
                        been in that period. Of course, he went there a second time in 1968, and
                        that was just a year before you left ILAB.</hi>

                        Munich. He was telling how they were going up there and Meany asked what
                        that meant, “Ich bin ein Berliner,” and he translated for him, and he
                        thought that might have slipped into the President's speech from his

                        had several other jobs before that — Venezuela, Argentina, and the

                        tour as Labor Attach� was after you were in ILAB. He went to Japan in 1969,
                        but he was in the State Department Foreign Service already, I believe. East

                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I was trying to think how we got him in. We had a hell of time
                    getting him in, I remember, because I worked on it for Carey. It was before I
                    went in as Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That got him in the State Department, I think, but then

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was a D.C.M. in a couple of places. In fact his

                        He went to Belgium, Algeria, and Vietnam, and I know ILAB at least concurred
                        in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, [ILAB] concurred in it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I had a lot of contact with him. Jim and I worked on the first plank in

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, Jim worked for Boris Shishkin, and I worked for Jim Carey. He was
                    representing Boris and the AFL-CIO, and I was representing Jim, and we did the
                    first study over at the N.L.R.B. on raiding between the AFL and the CIO. The
                    results of that study demonstrated that nobody gained from the raiding, and
                    everybody lost, because it cost everybody so much money. Nobody gained in terms
                    of membership. We did the study, and that was the first basis to get those guys
                    really talking seriously about merger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the first thing was a no raiding pact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes. Jim and I did the basic research on that. We were talking about it
                    last week</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. Looking at some of the more senior
                        people [on the Historical Roster], do you recall Fred Somerford going to the
                        Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, the name is familiar, but I don't recall it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason it sticks in my mind is that he was there a
                        year or so, and he got shot on the golf course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, I remember now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they said it was an accident, but I always wondered,
                        since there was so much hostility toward the U.S. down there. In fact I
                        think he was scheduled to go to be Assistant Labor Attach� in Rome, then
                        something happened on that assignment and he ended up as Labor Attach� in
                        the Dominican Republic and then he ended up dead. That was a tragedy. Chuck
                        Stewart, who was in the OECD in 1963, came out of ILAB. Did you have much
                        contact with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, yes, I had [contact with him], because I knew Chuck from ILAB. Well,
                    I knew him from the Department of Labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came out of that equivalent of ASP, I think. Did you go
                        over with the OECD Delegation on some of the ministerial meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I used to go with them. I went to many of their meetings.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Then, did you deal with Windsor Stroup in Pakistan

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: I never had any dealings with him. I remember the name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he had to be evacuated out of Pakistan with a
                        medical problem. He had a long operation in Germany. He had only been in
                        Pakistan less than a year , when he went on to New Zealand, because it was
                        better for his health. Barney Taylor, you probably knew, was in

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Barney came out of the CIO. He came out of the Newspaper Guild. I helped
                    get him into the Labor Attach� Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another one you helped recruit. Then he went to Honduras
                        in 1957, so you would have been active at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: With Jim Carey, yes.</p>

                        has retired yet or not. And Vic Ulriksson was in Germany in 1962. I don't
                        know if you had any contact with him there or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Not there, but afterwards here in the States, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heard about him when I was out at Wisconsin, because he
                        was one of Selig Perlman's disciples. He came out of the Telegraphers' Union
                        or something like that, and he went through the School of Workers and so on,
                        and became like an Assistant Professor or Professor there. He worked his way
                        up right from the laboring ranks. I see here he went to as Labor Attach� to
                        Indonesia in 1951. He was at that Labor Attach� Conference we had down in
                        Rome, I think.</hi>

                        early days of the Marshall Plan. Or maybe it was out of the Marshall

                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, it wasn't the Marshall Plan. It was when . . . OECD comes way after

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, Murray has done his own oral history. Ed

                <p>WEAVER: He was the head civil servant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but you had Leo Wertz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Leo succeeded him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leo took over when Zempel went overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zempel as you say was a civil servant, but there was an
                        Assistant Secretary over him. Like George Lodge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Oh, yes, but he was the top civil servant. I had a wonderful last talk
                    with Zemp before he died. He didn't die at post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. He came back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: His wife died while he was there. He used to take his meals at a private
                    home, that used to serve meals, served four or five people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he was overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WEAVER: In Paris. And he took me there one night to dinner, one of the great
                    meals that I had in France. No, I knew Zemp very well. I saw Zemp two or three
                    times after he came back. You know he was in a home here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Dan Lazorchek used to visit him out there. Well,
                        we have gone through most of the Labor Attach�s. Anything else that comes to
                        mind stimulated by all these names that we have dredged up? .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: No, I can't think of anything else. The thing that I would be interested
                    in in terms of the history is: What happened to the role of the Foreign Service
                    Board and the Labor Department's role in that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, actually that's diminished because the Board has now
                        got a broader responsibility. Since the Foreign Service Act of 1980, the
                        main function of the Board is to coordinate all of the agencies' foreign
                        services and not internally the State Department Foreign Service that we
                        participate in. So they consider that kind of a waste of their time to talk
                        about internal State Department Foreign Service matters as a rule, and they
                        talk about coordinating USIA's Foreign Service, AID's Foreign Service, . . .
                        Well, AID doesn't use the Foreign Service appointing authorities, but anyway
                        they are on there, and they try to coordinate . . . That's there main
                        function — to coordinate. And so the Labor Department role . . . They don't
                        meet as often as they used to, and even back when you were there . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Is the Labor Department represented on it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It will now be Jack Otero as soon as he gets sworn in
                        as Deputy Under Secretary. Now in recent years [Deputy Under Secretary of
                        Labor] Shellyn [G. McCaffrey] only went to one meeting of the Board of the
                        Foreign Service the whole time she was there. That was because it was the
                        farewell of Ambassador to the United Nations. He used to be Ambassador to
                        South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Yes, I knew him. What's his name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed Perkins. Anyway, she wanted to go to his last meeting
                        of the Board. which she did, but she had not attended any in all the rest
                        [of her time in office].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Now, who is in charge of the Board?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it has now been [given] back to the Director
                        General. Genta Hawkins is the . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: The Director General rather than the . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Than the “M” or the . . . At one time it was the Director
                        General.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: At one time it was the Under Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It came down to that because of labor relations reasons,
                        and really that was more in the 1970's and the 1960's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: Not in the 1960's. When I left it still had its position. The Under
                    Secretary for Management was the Chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they moved it down to the Director General. There
                        was a period when they didn't even want the Director General on the Board,
                        when the Board started getting into internal labor relations [matters]. When
                        the State Department union started becoming very active. Since the Board had
                        a role then in resolving the labor relations problems of State, they said
                        that it is not right for the Director General even to be on the Board, but
                        they have now gone back. The Director General heads the Board now, but as I
                        say, they do not get into internal State Department [policies].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEAVER: They don't pick the panel members, for example, for the promotion
                    panels?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. I think that they used to maybe wave them by them in
                        the past. Each agency . . . The Labor Department nominates two now. We used
                        to have three. Every year we were having three, the senior and the two
                        upper-mid career and even some of the others, but it has been hard getting
                        people to serve on that, so we only provide two now.</hi>
