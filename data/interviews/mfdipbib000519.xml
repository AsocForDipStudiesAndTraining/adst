                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you like to give me a little biographical data of
                        where you were born, your education, children, marriage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: I was born and raised on a farm in northwestern Iowa. I attended Iowa
                    State University where I earned my undergraduate degree. I earned my graduate
                    degree at Michigan State University. My undergraduate work was in the
                    agricultural production sciences. My graduate work was in agricultural economics
                    with a focus on agricultural and economic development in developing countries. I
                    became interested in the foreign service after living in Japan for part of a
                    year with Japanese farmers under the aegis of the International Farm Youth
                    Exchange Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: This was in 1955 from early June until December.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led you to join this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: This was a program implemented by the National 4-H Club Foundation,
                    and supported by a variety of major U.S. corporations and the State Department.
                    Its purpose was to encourage cultural exchanges between American and overseas
                    young farm people whose families and themselves were involved in rural youth
                    activities such as 4-H Club work. After having that experience in Japan, I
                    became very interested in working overseas. I went back to work for Iowa State
                    University for some four months and then, when I about to be drafted, I enlisted
                    in the U.S. Army for the counter-intelligence specialty. After basic training in
                    Arkansas and the Army Intelligence School training in Baltimore, I applied for
                    language study and had the opportunity to study Korean at the Army Language
                    School at the Presidio of Monterey in California. Eventually, in Korea after
                    promotion to sergeant, I was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in Korea in Military
                    Intelligence. With my language capacity, first in Japanese, then in Korean, I
                    became interested particularly in working in Japan or Korea, and doing something
                    that would make use of my agricultural training and experience. In 1959, the
                    Near East Foundation had a new USOM/K contract to help South Korea's government
                    launch a national rural community development program. Shortly after I was
                    discharged from the Army in April 1959, I was hired as one of several advisors
                    on that contract. That was the beginning of my association with what soon became
                    known as the U.S. Agency for International Development. At the time that I went
                    on that contract to Korea, USAID had not yet come into being. The Korea foreign
                    assistance mission was called the United States Operations Mission to Korea or
                    USOM/K.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of the old International Corporation
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Right. The ICA commenced operations as our U.S. foreign assistance
                    program in 1955. And it was in 1961 that our foreign assistance agency became
                    the USAID, United States Agency for International Development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were single at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: No. When I was in the Army I met a young lady who was managing the
                    Army Service Club in Yokohama, Japan. I was in Japan on R&amp;R from Korea. She
                    was transferred to Korea shortly after we met. A year or two later we were
                    married in Seattle, her hometown. That was in April 1959, just prior to going
                    back to Korea on the USOM/K contract. Our four children, three sons and a
                    daughter, were born in Korea between October 1960 and March 1966. Virginia and I
                    were married 26 years - until she died of cancer in 1985. Later I married her
                    best friend, who had been matron-of-honor at my first wedding. Janet and I have
                    been married nearly nine years. Getting back to my time with the U.S. foreign
                    assistance program in Korea, it was professionally a very exciting period.</p>
                <p>Work in Korea in rural development - 1960</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were first working with an AID contractor in
                        Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, the Near East Foundation had the USOM/K contract to help the
                    Republic of Korea's Government launch a national rural development program. I
                    was assigned to Taejon, capitol of Chung chong Namdo, located about 100 miles
                    south of Seoul. At the age 26, I became Advisor to the National Community
                    Development Program in four provinces.</p>
                <p>Third World rural community development programs have been the focus of a number
                    of analytical studies that have looked at the impact of a multi-sector
                    development approach versus a single sector development approach at the village
                    level. In the 1950s and early 1960s, rural community development was seen as a
                    way of providing technical assistance to improve the levels of living of rural
                    people, and also of developing democratic institutions at the grass roots
                    level.</p>
                <p>Over time the community development approach lost host-country political, and
                    external donor, support in most developing countries. By 1965, there were only a
                    small number of community development programs in existence around the world
                    that were being directly supported by national governments and donor
                    organizations. But during the '50s and early '60s, this was a very popular
                    donor-supported movement directed at responding to the spread of
                    totalitarianism, a euphemism for the spread of communism in the rural areas of
                    the developing world.</p>
                <p>The lessons learned are many and later in my career I authored a small book about
                    the rise and fall of the community development approach to rural development. I
                    found in my research that the approach worked very well where there was a
                    charismatic national leader who was willing to provide the political and other
                    resources needed to keep it moving forward and expanding. But where there was
                    not a charismatic leader who could provide the kind of environment that
                    encouraged multi-sectoral efforts, community development movements failed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You may want to include that publication, if you like, as
                        an appendix to this oral history if it's still available.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: That early rural community development movement is important in the
                    sense that about every decade, as donor agencies and Third World nations look
                    for ways of getting at basic development problems, they often return to the
                    rural community development approach as a model of some kind for a new rural
                    development effort. There is a tendency to try to reinvent the wheel. For
                    example, you remember the attention and impetus that was given to “integrated
                    rural development”, or IRD, in the 1970s and the beginning of the '80s - that
                    effort was modeled on the earlier rural community development movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. Were there host-government
                        counterparts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: The way it was organized in every country was quite similar. There
                    would be a national ministry or sub-ministry-level agency that would be attached
                    to the prime minister's or president's office. That agency would have a national
                    training facility, and staff at the national, provincial, and district level
                    that would provide the administrative and technical back-stopping for
                    village-level workers to organize villagers to cooperatively undertake projects
                    that would benefit their communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You felt that national level input was one of the keys
                        leading to success?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: The record was mixed. But generally those national efforts that had
                    the support of the president or the prime minister, for example Nehru in India
                    and Magsaysay in the Philippines, became major development efforts in those
                    nations. Wherever there was that kind of political support, these movements did
                    well. But in most nations the community development programs were competing with
                    the old-line ministries - agriculture, health, and education - and over time in
                    many instances significant animosities arose. And this carried over to some
                    degree into the donor agency's operations. For example, there was a great deal
                    of bureaucratic animosity between some of the U.S. advisors in the community
                    development division and those in the agricultural division of the USOM in
                    Korea. This did not cause any serious problems at the field level. But there was
                    a good deal of competition for budgetary and personnel resources between those
                    divisions in the mission. Being a contractor in the field, I was not privy to
                    what was going on in that regard at that time, but there have been papers
                    written about this - the controversy surrounding the community development
                    divisions in USAID missions around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Versus the agriculture...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Agriculture, health and education - because most of the community
                    development program that USAID supported had health, education and agriculture
                    elements. And so there was the sense that this multi-sectoral initiative wasn't
                    appropriately utilizing the skills of host country personnel in the technical
                    ministries. In Korea, the community development program was identified with
                    Syngman Rhee and then briefly with Chang Myon. When the coup d'�tat took place
                    and Park Chung Hee assumed power as chief of state, the national community
                    development entity was abolished. Most of its programs were subsumed by the
                    Ministry of Agriculture, with some by the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry
                    of Education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About what time would this have occurred?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: After the student uprisings, President Syngman Rhee resigned in April
                    1960. Then in July, Chang Myon was elected Prime Minister under the new
                    parliamentary cabinet system. The next year in May, some of the military
                    revolted and Park Chung Hee assumed power as Chairman of the Supreme Council for
                    National Reconstruction. Then in late 1963, Park Chung Hee was elected President
                    under the new Constitution that revived the presidential system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And by that time you had become...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: By that time I had become a direct hire foreign service officer. I
                    continued to serve in Taejon, but, after the coup, as the USAID provincial Rural
                    Development Officer. I was advisor to the governors of two provinces until
                    mid-1965. Then I was transferred to the USAID/K headquarters in Seoul and put in
                    charge of an expanded Provincial Rural Development Staff. We had at that time
                    two American advisors in each of the provinces.</p>
                <p>It was a rather exciting period because this was the time when all of the earlier
                    development efforts started to come to fruition. The Korean economy, both rural
                    and urban, started to take off. From 1962 through 1976, the Republic of Korea
                    maintained an average annual economic growth rate of about 10 percent. Exports
                    went up very rapidly - from only $50 million in 1962 to nearly $8 billion in
                    1976. Of course, per capita income also grew very substantially. Agricultural
                    yields increased very dramatically. All of this commenced in the early '60s. The
                    only significant external donor at that time was the United States. We made a
                    very substantial contribution to that effort.</p>
                <p>I remained in Korea until 1968. From mid-1968 until mid-1969, I was on the Korea
                    desk in USAID's Washington DC headquarters. My office was in the State
                    Department on the fourth floor above the diplomatic entrance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started as a contractor in Korea in 1959?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, and in 1963 I became a direct hire foreign service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And stayed on five years in Korea as a direct hire?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, I stayed on five years as a direct hire rural development
                    officer. I was the American direct hire officer in the USAID Mission who had
                    served in Korea the longest, and had tested fluency in the Korean language. So I
                    had the opportunity to become involved in interesting activities beyond my
                    responsibilities for the rural development field operations. For example, I had
                    the opportunity to do the Korean interpreting for many of the American VIP's
                    that visited Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your Korean counterparts as far as
                        capabilities and willingness to work with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: They were super; for the most part well trained and highly motivated.
                    At all levels they worked hard and played hard. Their culture stressed a strong
                    work ethic. I could work without an interpreter, so it was easier to form close
                    working and personal relationships with my Korean colleagues. I spent over
                    eleven years in Korea. I went there in the Army in 1957 and I left USAID/Korea
                    in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could be called a Korean hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: I could be called a young, “old Korean hand” at that time. Those were
                    really exciting days to be associated with the U.S. foreign assistance program
                    in Korea, as it was working so well in terms of helping the Koreans succeed in
                    formulating and implementing their ambitious Five Year Economic Development
                    Plans.</p>
                <p>I am always quite surprised to hear comments by supposedly knowledgeable people
                    that downplay the significance and importance of America's role in Korea's
                    unusually successful economic development effort. For example, I happened to
                    hear a Mr. Keyes, Republican candidate for president, on the PBS McNeil-Lehrer
                    News Hour a few months ago. When asked about the significance of America's role
                    in Korea's economic development - he stated something to the effect that
                    Americans didn't really do anything much in Korea in terms of foreign aid after
                    1960!</p>
                <p>Not true. In fact, it was during the '60s that our program was so large in terms
                    of personnel - direct hire and contract, technical and administrative - that
                    were working in Korea on behalf of the Korean development effort. We had
                    absolutely outstanding people, some more controversial than others, who provided
                    leadership to the U.S. aid effort in those days. When I arrived, there were a
                    number of Americans in agriculture and industry who had outstanding careers in
                    the States but who felt called to work in Korea. Korea was of importance to the
                    U.S. and free world in the minds of so many Americans with so many personal ties
                    forged during the Korean War.</p>

                <p>Semi-retired deans of American universities were coming out on long-term
                    assignments. The outstanding director of the research system of the state of
                    Texas was, for some time, our agricultural research advisor to the Ministry of
                    Agriculture. And a chap who operated a fertilizer producing factory in America
                    was operating the major fertilizer factory in Korea, as advisor to the Korean
                    who was managing that facility. We had some of the outstanding fisheries people
                    from the Pacific Northwest assisting the Koreans in developing their fishing
                    fleets - much to the chagrin of the American fisheries people today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't any shortage of American skills who were
                        willing to come forward.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: That's right. It was a unique opportunity for young persons like me to
                    work with world class professionals. Those were heady times. One of the
                    outstanding mission directors was Joel Bernstein. Joel was a bright economist,
                    who had earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago at a very young age. He and
                    our small economics staff provided a great deal of the intellectual leadership
                    to the Koreans in terms of their macroeconomic planning, their national programs
                    and policies. Joel and his deputy, Roger Ernst, also provided excellent
                    leadership to the several hundred Americans and Koreans, contract and direct
                    hire, were in the USAID/K Mission at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall it was one of the largest, if not the
                        largest...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: It was probably the largest USAID mission in the world at that time.
                    Iran had been - as I recall - the largest mission in the '50s and I believe
                    Korea was the largest in the '60s.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: It was certainly the one that influenced me the most in terms of my
                    own thinking and understanding of development and the role of the external
                    donor. I also thoroughly enjoyed my other overseas posts which were Ethiopia,
                    where I served for four years and the Philippines, where I also served for four
                    years. There were tours in Washington DC after each of my overseas assignments.
                    Ethiopia was particularly interesting because much of Ethiopia was still as it
                    had been a century or more ago.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that where you served after Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: After serving in Korea and a year on the Korean desk in
                    USAID/Washington, I was assigned to Ethiopia. I went out as the deputy head of
                    Rural Development Office in the USAID Mission. A short time later, the office
                    head departed as a result of health problems, so I headed up that office for
                    nearly four years. Ethiopia in a real sense - its development atmosphere - was
                    like Korea turned upside down. For example, Korea had a very low percentage of
                    illiteracy; Ethiopia had a very high percentage of illiterate people. Ethiopia
                    has a large land base; Korea's was very small. And on it went.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Ethiopia mid-1969. That was an promising era in Ethiopia's
                    development. At that time, a critical mass of U.S., Canadian, and
                    European-schooled Ethiopians, who had a clear vision of what needed to be done
                    in their particular field of endeavor, were back in Ethiopia. They were ready to
                    help improve the well-being of their less fortunate fellow citizens. This cadre
                    of well-trained young people, most in their early '30s with lots of vim and
                    vinegar, were greatly benefitted by the donor programs that provided them with
                    resources to move ahead in their specialties. We in the donor community were
                    very much a part of their effort to further economic and social change in that
                    very undeveloped nation, one of the poorest in the world.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately the political system was still quite antiquated and the policies
                    were in many instances not very supportive of the development efforts of these
                    young well-trained people. For example, Ethiopia still in the 1960s had a
                    somewhat feudalistic system of land tenure. Producers were not provided with the
                    incentive they needed in order to make investments in improving the productive
                    capacity of the lands that they farmed. And so their agriculture tended to be
                    more exploitative. Still, much progress was being made while we were there,
                    particularly in terms of training in health and education and agriculture. The
                    levels of living of the various peoples in Ethiopia were commencing to improve.
                    The malaria program, for example, was quite successful in reducing the incidence
                    of malaria in the lowlands. Unfortunately, the Ethiopian political advisors who
                    were closest to Haile Selassie were of an earlier generation. They did not
                    understand the need to undertake some significant reforms in land tenure,
                    economic reforms that would give more opportunities to the poor majority,
                    reforms that would commence to spread the wealth among the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were large holdings by...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Very large holdings were owned by many of the members of the royal
                    family, the Coptic church, and senior military officers and government
                    officials. They were given grants of land. They often did not use this land -
                    they did not farm the land themselves; they simply used the tenants who may have
                    already farmed the land. They had middlemen who would collect the rents from the
                    tenants. A lot of change for the better was being effected, but it wasn't
                    keeping pace with the expectations of the growing urban population, particularly
                    the poor. And thus it was that eventually Haile Selassie was deposed. In fact,
                    less than a year after I had departed Ethiopia, Haile Selassie was deposed and a
                    totalitarian communist-oriented state emerged. I have very fond memories of
                    Ethiopia and of those young Ethiopians who had been trained in Europe, the
                    United States and Canada. The dedication that they had to improving the
                    well-being of their fellow citizens... Most of these young educated leaders -
                    during the ensuing regime - were either killed or left the country. Large
                    numbers sought political asylum abroad, and went to work for various bilateral
                    and multilateral aid agencies. Those of my Ethiopian colleagues that were not
                    imprisoned or killed wound up in UN organizations, at the African Development
                    Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary
                    Fund. Ethiopia went through some hellishly difficult times as a society and a
                    people after Mengistu assumed control of the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to the coup did AID have a relatively large program
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, it was a very significant program. The geopolitical reason for
                    the large program was the fact that in this era before communications satellites
                    were in place, the US military maintained a communications facility in Eritrea
                    called Kagnew Station. American economic and technical assistance was to some
                    degree a quid pro quo for having that large, very substantial facility, in
                    Ethiopia. After the satellites were in place, there was no longer the need for
                    the communications facility. Part of its mission, as I recall, was to eavesdrop
                    on radio communications from Russian and the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then this was related to the Cold War, at least to some
                        extent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Although I don't recall it being discussed, I understood that the
                    level of aid for Ethiopia was a result of our having a military facility in the
                    country. We were very proud of the institutions that we helped build, starting
                    from scratch, such as the national university in Addis Ababa and the college of
                    agriculture at Alemaya near Harar where the Oklahoma State University provided
                    technical assistance for almost two decades. These institutions - during the
                    Mengistu years - underwent some very difficult times, although they have
                    reopened and are in operation at this time.</p>
                <p>Return to USAID/Washington and working in agriculture and rural development in
                    Southeast Asia and Jordan - 1973</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>After Ethiopia, I went back to Washington and headed up the Agriculture and Rural
                    Development Division in the Supporting Assistance Bureau, which was the bureau
                    responsible for overseas programs in Southeast Asia and Jordan. That was an
                    interesting time because we were very much involved in making decisions that
                    would impinge upon USAID's largest program, Vietnam, as well as programs in Laos
                    and Cambodia. I had the opportunity during that period to visit those countries
                    and to gain some understanding of the difficulties of undertaking economic and
                    technical assistance programs in politically unstable areas that were close to
                    being or had become war zones. I have a great deal of admiration for those of my
                    colleagues who served in those posts during those difficult years in the
                    '70s.</p>
                <p>I was in Korea and on my way to Vietnam the very day that the Embassy closed in
                    Saigon. I arrived in Hong Kong to catch a PanAm flight to Saigon the day the
                    Embassy was evacuated. I had earlier had the opportunity to serve on the joint
                    State-Aid task force that was sent to the Pentagon to work with the DOD on a
                    program to ascertain the amount of economic and military support Vietnam would
                    need to sustain its operations during the summer and fall of 1975. That was an
                    curious exercise because we - Stu Callison and Hadley Smith, and several other
                    military officers - would disappear into the bowels of the Pentagon every day
                    and study the potential impact of several truncated versions of a South Vietnam.
                    We tried to ascertain what resources were needed to sustain the various
                    scenarios.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Those were curious times. I recall the task force involved long days
                    most of February and March. After that I went out to Asia and nearly arrived in
                    Vietnam at the very end of our presence there. The day after Saigon fell, I went
                    on to Manila from Hong Kong. I ran into a few of my former colleagues who had
                    just arrived from Saigon. They had all had harrowing evacuation experiences. I
                    saw our Ambassador from Saigon, Graham Martin, dining alone at Sea Front the day
                    after I arrived in Manila. I had met him briefly on an earlier visit to Saigon,
                    and had read many of his recent Vietnam situation and outlook cables.</p>

                <p>HOLDCROFT: Commencing in September 1975, I spent a year at Michigan State. That
                    was just prior to going out to the Philippines in September of 1976, which,
                    Charles, is where we first met you and Liz.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: That's right. I had a year of long-term graduate school training in
                    agricultural economics. I had a very heavy schedule because I was doing research
                    on rural development and lecturing, as well as taking a full class load. Carl
                    Eicher was my very capable major advisor. Carl and the other faculty were very
                    encouraging and helpful. I was given an appointment as a visiting scholar. It
                    was an intellectually stimulating, but very demanding year. My understanding of
                    development was greatly enhanced. I didn't do much with my family that year.
                    Fortunately, my wife was very supportive.</p>
                <p>The day after my orals, our family departed Michigan for the Philippines. There I
                    met you at a very difficult time for the USAID/Philippines Mission because our
                    good friend and colleague, Garnett Zimmerly, the Mission Director, had just died
                    in a plane crash. The tragedy occurred about a week before we arrived. You would
                    remember that better than I do.</p>

                    you hosted the evening we arrived was the first time that the USAID staff had
                    had a social function since his death.</p>

                    although as you'll recall it had its ups and downs. But the dynamic leadership
                    that the Philippine agricultural sector being provided by the Minister of
                    Agriculture was something to behold. The way that various public and private
                    resources were mobilized in this push for rice and food self-sufficiency was
                    most impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your working relationships with your
                        counterparts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: They were really super. I had good personal and professional relations
                    with all of my colleagues in the Philippines. It was rather expected for a
                    number of reasons. I had had the good fortune of having been in and out of the
                    Philippines on short-term visits since the '50s. So I knew something about the
                    people and the country. I had known a number of the Filipino agricultural
                    leaders for some years. Also I had worked in 1975 on the strategy that the USAID
                    Mission was employing for its agriculture and rural development efforts.
                    Therefore, I was well prepared to head up the USAID Agricultural Development
                    Office in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find them competent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Very competent. Mostly they were trained at U.S. graduate schools.
                    They were very well prepared, but unfortunately caught in a situation where they
                    had to walk the line between doing what was expected of them by their President
                    and a political system that wanted to maintain the status quo. They knew what
                    needed to be done in order to move forward their programs directed to helping
                    the poor people - the poor farmers, the poor urban dwellers. But change would
                    usually be at some cost to those few hundred families that controlled the
                    political economy. So reform was a slow process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this politics versus economic development? Was that
                        the way you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, in most regards that is correct. The “patron” mentality and the
                    application of the “patron” system to political organizations inhibited change
                    that addressed the real problems of the poor and otherwise disadvantaged. The
                    “patron” system is the old social system the Spaniards brought to their colonies
                    around the world. It involves unquestioning loyalty to the big man, the hacienda
                    owner, or the political leader. Then the “patron” is required to look after the
                    welfare of his followers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the program suffer in the late Marcos years due to the
                        known shortcomings of that administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes. Increasingly those programs that were directed at improving
                    levels of living of the poorer segments of Philippine society were less
                    effective. For example, in terms of reaching its stated objectives, the land
                    reform program was increasingly watered down. The bottom line was that the rich
                    were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer. Studies that we helped
                    finance by the University of the Philippines/Diliman indicated that the
                    distribution of income nationwide was becoming more skewed.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, since that time the situation has improved immensely. And although
                    now I'm not following the Philippines closely, my sense is that the economy is
                    probably doing better now than it has in any number of years. Perhaps as well or
                    better than it has done since the early years of Marcos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The technocrats, I gather, were making considerable
                        progress in the early Marcos years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: That's right. There were a lot of institutional and technological
                    innovations that could and did quickly impact favorably on the economy in the
                    early Marcos years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of your most prominent success stories
                        or failures there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: It started before I arrived and continued on after I departed, but the
                    most successful efforts that we were involved in were those that were associated
                    with the rice and food self-sufficiency programs. We played a very key role in
                    linking the expertise being trained and technology being produced at the
                    International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to the Filipino farmer. We were the
                    catalysts that made it possible for IRRI's world-renown resources to be made
                    available very quickly to Philippine agriculture. That's particularly noteworthy
                    with rice, but the same applies to other crops as we made available the work of
                    other international research centers. The newest technology in maize and wheat
                    came from CIMMYT in Mexico, and in horticultural crops from the Asian Vegetable
                    Research Center on Taiwan. At any rate, agricultural technology development and
                    transfer was a very successful program and we were the major - and usually the
                    only donor - supporting those kind of activities. Of course, our support to the
                    educational and research institutions, the numerous colleges of agriculture and
                    Philippine Agricultural Research Council, also had very high returns.
                    Incidentally, the Philippines Agricultural Research Council has become a model
                    for countries around the world to use in setting up institutions to develop
                    effective and efficient national agricultural research efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it that the University of Kansas or Kansas State
                        that had a large project out there? Did it ever succeed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: You know that that program was still going on when I left. Certainly
                    it was successful in terms of the part of it that was supporting Central Luzon
                    State University and its college of agriculture. I don't have good handles on
                    what the marketing component contributed to the growth of the Philippine
                    agricultural sector. Certainly the educational part of it was very effective.
                    The mechanisms for developing packages of technology that small farmers could
                    easily use to increase their output in some areas - even while I was there - was
                    successful. But I don't know what happened after 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you experience the clash between provincial
                        development and agriculture, as you were exposed to with community
                        development in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: No. It's interesting that we had a close working relationship among
                    the Bicol Program, the Provincial Development Office, and the Agricultural
                    Development Offices. We cooperated very closely. I don't remember even one
                    controversy. I think it's in part a function of the cordial relationships of the
                    office heads, namely Don Wadley, Bill Sommers and myself. We never had any
                    problems.</p>
                <p>I do remember a kind of turf problem between my office and Capital Development
                    Office, headed by Dick Dangler, with regard to which office should have the
                    small scale irrigation project. It came to my office from the Capital
                    Development Office and he wanted it back. The issue was whether or not that it
                    should be in the Agricultural Development Office with its agricultural technical
                    staff or in the Capital Development Office with its civil engineering staff. I
                    didn't feel strongly about it, but the U.S. contract staff on the project
                    maintained that they would get better support if it stayed in our office. My
                    recollection now is that it went back to the Capital Development Office about
                    the time that I departed Manila. These kinds of issues were minimal...
                    Generally, the Philippines was a neat place to work. Q: The climate there was
                    both a hindrance and conducive to agricultural development, I suppose.</p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, it's a tough place, agriculturally speaking, because the land
                    resource has been much abused. In 1955, something like 90 percent of the country
                    was covered in forest and now it's less than five percent. There has been so
                    much erosion and leaching, and so many associated problems that the productive
                    capacity of those tropical soils is greatly reduced. Pest and disease problems
                    are extreme because of the climate and people pressure on the land. On the
                    positive side, crops can be raised the year around. Three crops of rice per
                    annum is common.</p>

                <p>New assignment as chief of the Technical Resources Office of the USAID/Africa
                    Bureau - 1980</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: 1980. That's right. I was assigned to the Africa Bureau in USAID's
                    Washington DC headquarters. I headed up the Africa Bureau's Agricultural and
                    Rural Development Division for two years, and then the Bureau's newly
                    established Technical Resources Office for two years. Q: When you first got back
                    there you used as one of your consultants Dr. Vernon Johnson. Is that correct?
                    He just did a long interview with Haven North on his experience with AID
                    agriculture. HOLDCROFT: Yes, I had know Vern for a number of years. He really
                    knew African agriculture, and we thought it was important that he continue to
                    work on African agricultural issues. There were other very experienced people
                    like Vern that consulted with us at that time. We needed all the expertise that
                    was available as we were formulating a strategy and program to respond to the
                    deteriorating food situation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some others that come to
                    mind are Ryland Holmes, Rex Daly, Ev Headrick, Wendell McMillan, Boyd Whittle,
                    Fran La Beau and Ed Hogan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were with the agricultural division of the Africa
                        bureau...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: For two years and then the new Technical Resources Office. What had
                    been the Development Resources Office was divided roughly into two units: the
                    Technical Resources Office and the Project Development Office. Over those four
                    years, I worked closely with and for Haven North and then Ray Love. They were
                    the senior career persons in the Africa Bureau. They were both very supportive
                    of our efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were the deputy assistant administrators, career
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: That's right. The head of the Development Resources Office when I
                    arrived in the Bureau was John Koehring, a very dedicated officer and a
                    gentleman. I've kept in touch with John and his wife over the years. He is
                    living now in Connecticut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a very large staff that you had in the Technical
                        Resources Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes it was. We had sixty-some professional technical staff, direct
                    hire and contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it difficult in the Africa Bureau to get
                        staffing assigned to the field because of the hardship posts? Were you
                        supported?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: It was a problem. It was very difficult to find people who were
                    willing to go to places where there were not adequate schools for their children
                    or had limited health care facilities. Having said that, we did have some very
                    fine and competent people who assumed assignments to places that left a lot to
                    be desired in terms of creature comforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And sometimes the morale at those posts was higher than

                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: It was usually a function of the leadership that was being provided by
                    the U.S. ambassador and the head of the USAID operation.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other factor in recent years that has come into play
                        for those assignments is meaningful work for the spouse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Yes, these dual career assignments have been an increasing challenge
                    to arrange as time has gone on. I've had the opportunity since my retirement to
                    work in a number of USAID missions in Africa and Asia and it's very curious to
                    see the changes in attitudes with regard to spouses working in the same mission
                    and often the same office. Certainly when you and I commenced our careers,
                    spouses would never be assigned to jobs that in any way were clearly related.
                    That is certainly not the case now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. What do you think the biggest problems that
                        we encountered in AID in implementing programs in Africa as opposed to your
                        experience in Korea and the Philippines? You alluded to this to some degree
                        with respect to Ethiopia, but I assumed that you had broader exposure to it
                        when you had the whole Africa continent...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: The most significant difference in my experience was the paucity of
                    trained manpower in Africa as compared with Asia. Only a few years ago, it was
                    very difficult to communicate with many Africans because they simply had such a
                    different world view than did our non-African colleagues who were trying to
                    assist them in understanding some facet of development. Having said that, there
                    were some very notable exceptions. For example, I'm still in touch with Eduardo
                    Tapsoba, a former Minister of Agriculture in Burkina Faso. When I first knew him
                    when he was a graduate student at Michigan State. Or Dunston Spencer, an
                    outstanding Sierra Leonean, trained at the University of Illinois, who has held
                    senior government posts in that country.</p>
                <p>Today the situation has much improved. There are now in most African countries,
                    Sub-Saharan African countries, that critical mass of trained technical people.
                    That critical mass that can sustain those basic institutions in agriculture,
                    education, and health needed to move those countries forward. Of course the
                    political environment must be favorable for them to do well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the foreign donors addressing this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLDCROFT: Certainly we did. We did at least until the mid-1980s. We were very
                    sensitive to the need for building basic institutions that would sustain
                    development. Since the mid-1980s there has been less interest by donors in
                    supporting institutions that would require longer term investments. There has
                    been more interest in looking for short-term panaceas that would provide some
                    pay-off sooner rather than later.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>My sense is that over the last decade there has been decreased donor support for
                    building those basic institutions in health, education and agriculture for
                    sustained development, while at the same time there had been much more support
                    for reform of the macroeconomic environment. Thus attention has been on national
                    policy reform, structural adjustment and private sector growth.</p>

                        Did they consider that they were on a cold war or geopolitical mission or
                        that they had technical, expert knowledge to transfer and better the life of
                        people in the Third World which would be a credit to the U.S. in the
                        economic development sphere.</hi>

                <p>HOLDCROFT: I think that most technical personnel in USAID, including myself, have
                    been motivated mostly by the satisfaction gained from helping the poor and
                    disadvantaged. This is in the American Judeo-Christian tradition of helping the
                    poor. None-the-less, we were aware that we were involved in a cold war,
                    especially in places like Indochina.</p>
                <p>Another relevant question is how did the technical personnel feel about their
                    role in the Agency, vis-a-vis the non-technical personnel. There were in the
                    earlier part of my career more incentives for people to excel in their technical
                    areas of expertise than experienced later on. It's clear that the incentives to
                    pursue a career in agriculture, education, health, or engineering decreased over
                    the 25 years that I was associated with the Agency. Having said that, in the
                    early 1980s there was an effort on the part of Administrator Peter McPherson and
                    Assistant Administrator for Science and Technology Nyle Brady to give more
                    recognition to the technical personnel. The numbers of all types of technical
                    personnel declined dramatically, commencing in the mid-1980s. Especially
                    engineering promotions and positions both declined precipitously until the
                    number of bona-fide engineers was minuscule. Several years ago, I was involved
                    in doing a couple of studies of the Agency's technical personnel. But that's a
                    whole other chapter not for discussion today.</p>
                <p>Well, this has been great, Charles. I appreciate the opportunity to see you again
                    and share with you and whomever the transcript of our conversation today.</p>
