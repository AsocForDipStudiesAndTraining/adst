                <p>HERMAN POLLACK</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas Stern </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herman, as it is customary in these interviews, we like to
                        start with a brief description of your back ground, education and the
                        reasons why you joined the Federal Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK : I was raised on Long Island, went to what was then know as the City
                    College of New York during the tail end of the Depression. I majored in the
                    social sciences and graduated with a degree in Social Science, having taken many
                    history and government courses. Following graduation in 1940, I found that jobs
                    were not readily available, so I went for a Masters Degree in economics at
                    Columbia University during the 1940-41 academic year. This was to round out my
                    education in the social sciences. Like many of my contemporaries, I had taken
                    the Civil Service examination. As a result, in the late summer of 1941, I got a
                    call from Washington, asking me to come for an interview. I did so and went to
                    the Office of Emergency Management. I went through a period of four months
                    during which all was confusion. The Office was expanding very rapidly at that
                    time. The first job to which I was assigned was abolished before I could even
                    get there. I stuck around OEM until something else could be worked out. That
                    something else happened to be in the Personnel office, despite my background in
                    economics which I had hoped to use. Since income was fairly important at the
                    time, I took the personnel assignment and started to work a day or two after
                    Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>I chose the Federal Government for two reasons: a) I had some vague notion of
                    public service being a more attractive way of life than the private sector—as a
                    matter of fact, I had turned down an offer to become a trainee with one of the
                    big airlines; and b) at the time, $1,440 or $1,620, whichever it was, looked
                    like a lot of money to me. Indeed compared to my previous earnings from
                    part-time employment, the federal entrance salary level was a princely sum. It
                    was attractive.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>So I started in the OPA's Personnel office and stayed for about eighteen months.
                    I started as a classification analyst. The guru of classification in those years
                    was a man by the name Stan O'Rear, who made his reputation in classification
                    himself, but then worked in one of OPA's operating divisions. My immediate boss
                    was a woman, Margaret Bremer, who was not only very capable, but who also taught
                    me how to write English with a minimal use of adjectives and adverbs. This was
                    probably the best training in writing that I had ever had. It spoiled my ability
                    to wax eloquently. I still shy away from hyperbole or even descriptive words and
                    tend to be expository in what I write.</p>
                <p>Then I went into the military service in March, 1943. I immediately contracted
                    hepatitis and a few other ailments and then I was discharged for having poor
                    vision. I returned to OPA and followed a man named Paul Canaipe, who changed his
                    name later to Camp, when he went to the War Shipping Administration. We were at
                    WSA for about a year when our earlier boss, Ken Warner, became personnel
                    director of the Foreign Economic Administration. So I joined him there as a
                    management analyst in his office and stayed there until the end of the war. My
                    main task was to write policies and procedures on subjects such as
                    reductions-in-force. There was a brief period during which they moved FEA into
                    the Department of Commerce, although the staff never actually moved.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere in Washington, during the war years, was absolutely hectic. It was
                    also a period of great upheaval and change. When I first came to Washington in
                    1941, it was still a “southern” city. The lunch rooms were segregated. If you
                    got on a bus top go to Virginia and sat in the back, the driver would ask you to
                    move forward when you crossed the Virginia line because the back was reserved
                    for the blacks. This was also the period when the Americans Veterans Committee
                    was organized, among other reasons, to compete with the established veterans
                    groups in an effort to provide veterans a more liberal voice. We engaged in
                    desegregation activities in theaters where blacks had been forced to sit in the
                    balcony and in restaurants which they had not been able to enter. So it was a
                    period of extreme turmoil.</p>
                <p>On the management side, the governing rule was to get the job done. Regulations
                    were not the end-all. Every agency that participated in the war effort was in a
                    constant state of reorganization. Young people who had little experience were
                    given major responsibilities. One of the lasting impression that I gained from
                    those days is that given the opportunity, people with talent will rise and
                    surprise you with their capabilities to achieve. The legal counsel at OPA was a
                    Columbia University professor—twenty-five years old— who, like all the other
                    lawyers, walked around without ties and with shirt sleeves turned up. That was a
                    major break through in the government officials' dress code. This acceptance of
                    the new eventually even applied to the State Department. In prior times, Foreign
                    Service Inspectors, when writing their commentaries on each officer inspected,
                    would comment on the officer's appearance. If you wore a beard or a goatee you
                    would have been informed in various ways that that was not proper or
                    appropriate. And certainly, if you were caught with your jacket off, you were
                    told, as I one was by Tom Estes once, that that was also highly
                    inappropriate.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>While still at FEA, one day, while walking on the street, I ran into John Miles,
                    who had worked in FEA's personnel office, but had left to go to work for the
                    Department of State. We hadn't seen each other for an extended period. We
                    exchanged the usual pleasantries and promised to have lunch together at sometime
                    and then parted. Much to my surprise, a week later I got a call from John,
                    asking me to have lunch with him. It turned out that someone else joined us,
                    namely Carl Humelsine, who was then the Assistant Secretary for Administration,
                    which was the top administrative position in those days. Carl had worked with
                    General George Marshall at the Pentagon and when Marshall became Secretary of
                    State, Humelsine came with him. I was still young in 1946—26 or 27 years old—,
                    but had done well in the civil service. I was probably a General Schedule (GS)
                    14 or 15, which was the top of pay schedule. Humelsine called me for a
                    discussion later. I must have passed the lunch screening because all he wanted
                    to know then was what I wanted to do. The Department was trying to staff itself
                    with young people. I explained my general interest in management; I did not
                    mention personnel; I had had enough of that at that point. So he sent me to see
                    Just Lunning, who was the head of the Department's management staff. He was born
                    in Denmark and still had a slight accent. His father owned Jensen's on Fifth
                    Avenue in New York. During the war years, Just had worked in a variety of
                    intelligence assignments and then had transferred to the Department. So I went
                    to work for the Department in the Department's central management staff. Just
                    gave me a couple of assignments to start me off. My very first assignment—and
                    remember I knew precious little about the Department—was to work on the plans
                    for the new building. Specifications were being developed so that the General
                    Service Administration (GSA) could come up with some design requirements that
                    the architects would have to fulfill. The old State Department had a library,
                    which when the building was built in 1887, was the epitome of the library
                    science. It was the most advanced library of its day. The facility by the time I
                    joined the Department, had been in existence some 60 odd years. The question
                    then became what should the library of the future look like. To try to get an
                    answer, the Department employed a Mr. Osborne, the Librarian of Harvard
                    University. I was assigned as his assistant. Together we went through the old
                    library. I found very interesting the way an experienced librarian made an
                    assessment. He would count shelf feet and look for the standards authoritative
                    books that any respectable collection should include. He found that there were
                    more volumes on the Civil War than there were on the Spanish-American and World
                    War I conflicts. There was much less on World War II. He found that the library
                    was not a working library, but rather an archive. I remember how aghast he was
                    when he went upstairs under the eaves to find a newspaper collection that went
                    back to 1801. These were big, thick folio volumes. about 4” thick and very
                    large. They were stacked one on top of the other so that you couldn't retrieve
                    the bottom copies anyway. Of course they hadn't been used and were just being
                    stored. He also found that the roof was leaking, so that there was considerable
                    water damage. Osborne would have given his right arm to have that material
                    available at Harvard for the use of scholars who would have found it a gold mine
                    of information. Downstairs, when you entered into the library, which was a very
                    attractive facility. there was a glass case, which held the Articles of
                    Confederation, one of the two or three sets then extent. The rooms were not air
                    conditioned although the Articles were the pride of the Library. He was
                    horrified that a document of such great national and historical importance was
                    being treated this way. Osborne saw to it that the Articles were transferred as
                    quickly as possible to the Archives or the Library of Congress were they would
                    be given proper care.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>That was typical of the Department of 1946; it lived in the past. It was at this
                    time in the process of absorbing what had been the Office of War Information and
                    part of the Office of Strategic Studies (OSS). The Department was growing by
                    leaps and bounds, although psychologically it was still the State Department of
                    1939—a small, cozy organization, small enough so that all of the officers had
                    known each other. The Department was physically scattered all over Washington. I
                    started in a temporary building behind what is now known as Old State. There was
                    no New State; many of us were in temporary buildings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Humelsine or anyone else in State find your youth and
                        rank to be incompatible with the personnel structure of a traditional,
                        “old-line” bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: Humelsine did not, but the personnel people had great difficulties
                    accepting the situation. They wanted me to take a lower grade; I thanked them,
                    but I told them that I would not accept a lower rank just to join the
                    Department. They finally accepted my position, but it was not easy for them. The
                    Department was having great difficulty in adjusting to the post World War period
                    which was a period of tremendous upheaval. First of all, the Department had been
                    shunted aside during the most of the War years. The military , the Treasury
                    Department and the Foreign Economic Administration were playing the predominant
                    roles in the international relations area. State grew only slightly during the
                    War and was not very much different by the end of it than it was before it. It
                    looked upon itself as an elite organization, one with a special relationship to
                    the President. The Department viewed itself as the President's staff on foreign
                    policy and resented the perceived intrusion by other agencies on what had been
                    its essentially private turf. It had no concept on how to adjust to the post-War
                    role that the United States had to play. In 1939, the U.S. was still essentially
                    a country that shielded itself from the world surrounding it. After the War, the
                    U.S. found itself as the predominant world power with much of the world
                    depending on it for both political and economic leadership. It took the
                    Department several decades to adjust to that new the world situation and I am
                    not certain that it has fully accommodate to it yet. Of course, just about now,
                    the world situation is turning around from a one or two nation hegemony to a
                    multi-polar world.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>When intelligence and information activities were created in the Department,
                    initially it merely reflected a transfer of a group of people who showed on the
                    organization chart as a new activity. There was no interchange between these new
                    additions and the “old-timers”. Some years later in the late 1940s, when I was
                    on the administrative staff of the Bureau of European Affairs, we brought in a
                    new group of people. I remember a frustrated Tony Maccocio, an information
                    specialist who later became the head of the information office, seeking to find
                    out how he could be invited to lunch by some of the Foreign Service officers and
                    other established members of the Bureau. He felt very isolated from the rest of
                    the Bureau; he and the other recent arrivals were viewed as “uncouth”—in the
                    literal sense—different and foreign. The Foreign Service of course dominated the
                    Department, but the whole institution was a unified, integrated organization.
                    There were professional non-Foreign Service officers who felt the same way about
                    this invasion of “outsiders”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked for Carl Humelsine, who was the senior
                        management official of the Department. Do you have any recollection of the
                        relationship that Humelsine had with the Secretary or the Under
                        Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: He had a close relationship with the Secretary because he, like a number
                    of other officials, had come with Marshall from the Defense Department or War
                    Department. He therefore enjoyed the Secretary's confidence. The Under Secretary
                    was Bedell Smith, another former military man. But these two were not the kind
                    who intervened in the daily activities of their subordinates. They were trying
                    to bring the Department into a position of being able to carry its own role
                    inside the government. The Department had a bad reputation at that point in time
                    and it was certainly not geared to perform its post-war function. I was assigned
                    another project, namely to study the ILH (International Labor and Health) office
                    which was within the International Organization Division. The ILH office was
                    headed by Otis Mulligan. The principal reason for the study was the interest of
                    the Department of Labor which was riding high following Francis Perkins' tenure
                    as Secretary. It was concerned about the role of the Labor Attach� overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>My career in the Department was largely determined by a change in the senior
                    management officials. Humelsine became the Executive Secretary of the Department
                    and was succeeded by Jack Peurifoy. The Executive Secretariat was a new
                    organization created by Marshall and Humelsine. In those days, when a classified
                    message was sent overseas, it was typed on a telegram form and was sent to the
                    Secretary for review since his name would be at the end of the text. The people
                    who reviewed all these messages was a group of very pleasant women who looked at
                    the grammar, the conciseness and style of the message. They improved my use of
                    the English language considerably. I got a great deal of instruction from that
                    group. When one of these people in the Secretary's office finished the review,
                    you took the message back to your office for retyping, obtained other necessary
                    approvals and then it was sent to the code room where the message was retyped
                    into a machine that would encode and transmit it. That process was of course
                    reversed at the receiving end. It was a slow and laborious process. The
                    Department was very slow in modernizing itself. The use of the telephone for
                    international calls was not an accepted practice, not so much because of the
                    security issue, but because it was novel and expensive. This situation lasted a
                    longtime. Later when the foreign assistance program was established. its
                    personnel was aggressive and used the telephone because there was no record was
                    made and it was rapid. State still required its personnel to have a form filled
                    in and approved before a long-distance call could be made. I complained bitterly
                    to Livingston Merchant, then Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, that we
                    were being taken advantage of by people who were more attuned to the modern
                    era.</p>
                <p>After Peurifoy took over as Assistant Secretary for Administration, I was
                    assigned to work for Arthur Kimball, who was Peurifoy's special assistant. I was
                    assigned to work on the transfer of responsibilities for the “occupied areas”
                    from the military to the State Department. There was an office in the Department
                    headed by former general Hilldring. On his staff was a former colonel by the
                    name Joe Frank. Frank and Kimball, with me as the senior assistant, made up a
                    team that planned the transfer of the “occupation” responsibilities. Some people
                    thought it was ludicrous that State would be able to take on these
                    responsibilities. I still remember the phrase that George Marshall used once
                    when he was returning from Europe on a ship. As he arrived in New York, he was
                    met by the usual mob of reporters. When asked by one of them whether it was true
                    that the Department would take on these new responsibilities. When he answered
                    in the affirmative, he was then asked whether he thought the Department would be
                    able to handle the new functions. His answer was in effect that there was no
                    better way to commence than to begin. That was typical George Marshall. Frank,
                    Kimball and I spent several years on this issue. We started with Korea, then on
                    to Germany and then Austria. I worked on this transfer until late 1949 or early
                    1950.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>At about this time, the Department was also undergoing a fundamental change,
                    thanks primarily to the Hoover Commission report. Hoover's chief assistant was
                    Dean Acheson, who became Secretary of State in 1951. By 1950, there was a new
                    spirit emerging in the Department. There were a lot of new faces. There were
                    major projects undertaken to implement the Hoover Commission recommendations.
                    Various task forces which worked late at night. There was a spirit of
                    creativity, which has probably not been duplicated in the Department since. As a
                    consequence of the very wide participation in this effort to devise a new State
                    organization, led by Dean Acheson, there were very few officers who did not
                    understand what the new Department was designed to do and what its functions and
                    goals were. It was a major undertaking. This effort produced a much stronger
                    Secretariat; that in turn also produced a much better understanding of the
                    meaning of a “clearance” procedure. The pre-Hoover Commission clearance
                    procedures in the Department were very constipated; it was used as a means to
                    block policy development, not to improve it. The Hoover Commission understood
                    the problem and made a clear distinction between “veto” clearances and
                    “advisory” clearances. This difference was pretty well understood and observed
                    in the Department until the mid 1950's. Gradually, the distinction became
                    blurred again. I was brought back into it in again in 1959 when I was the
                    Department Management Officer. We reopened the question at that time in an
                    effort to re-educate a brand new generation of officers in the meaning of
                    “clearance”. We may have succeeded in returning one-fourth of the way back to
                    where the Hoover Commission had put the issue.</p>
                <p>But back to my work of assisting the transition overseas from a military
                    government to a civilian one. I had an opportunity to visit all three countries.
                    I went to Korea about 1947, before the Korean War, with a group of State
                    officials which included Glenn Wolfe. It had been devastated. Seoul's hillsides
                    were bare; no trees—all used for fuel during the war years. The major hotel was
                    built by Germans early in the century, called the Chosun Hotel. We drank our
                    water out of a chlorine bag. The tap water was not potable if it ran at all. The
                    city was destroyed and the American military thought it was the rear end of the
                    world. They were delighted to see us because we offered the prospect that they
                    could leave Korea in the reasonable near future. The military was running an
                    occupation government and couldn't wait to leave. When we arrived, there was no
                    civilian activity except a small assistance group which provided some economic
                    aid. Matters were very rugged. Amoebic diseases were rampant. We were in Korea
                    to design a plan for the replacement of the military administration by a
                    civilian one. Korea would continue to be occupied territory. We were looking to
                    see what resources might be available, what housing could be expected, what
                    facilities would be required and what the military might continue to do to
                    support the American officials. The situation was very difficult. I remember
                    that the military tried to keep its commissary supplies on a concrete area
                    surrounded by an electrified fence. We were told the Koreans would tunnel in
                    under the fence and the goods would disappear in the night despite the thick
                    concrete base. The Koreans were very resourceful and ingenious, as later shown
                    by the science students it sent to the U.S., for advanced academic training.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>In the case of Germany, John J.McCloy was appointed as High Commissioner,
                    succeeding General Lucius Clay, who may have had the same title. I, as well as
                    many other, accompanied McCloy on his first visit to Germany. Glenn Wolfe was
                    brought into the administration of the High Commissioner's office, as the chief
                    administrative official. When I visited Germany in 1948=49, it was still
                    devastated. You could see the bombing damage. The American military was living
                    quite well in beautiful homes. General Clay's staff, particularly those involved
                    in political developments, was a very dedicated group. I spent sometime with
                    them. That staff of political analysts was headed by a Dr. Pollock from the
                    University of Michigan. He had helped draft a constitution which gave
                    considerable authority to the Laender (states). I remember going to Berlin where
                    we were given a presentation. That was my fist exposure to an Air Force
                    briefing, which was done with great skill and art. Everything was being superbly
                    managed and there were no unsolved problems. McCloy was a unique individual. He
                    walked around with a German dictionary in his hand to make the point that his
                    staff should learn German. The transfer from military to civilian authority went
                    relatively smoothly in Germany. It was a much different environment in Germany
                    than in Korea, which at that time was viewed as the rear end of the world, with
                    some justification.</p>
                <p>When later I was assigned to the Bureau of European Affairs, I had the
                    opportunity to stay in contact with German and Austrian issues. In both
                    countries, there was a great deal of foreign currency to be spent. We spent it
                    liberally and that helped to move matters along expeditiously. For example, our
                    staff moved from Frankfurt to Bonn, the new German capital, in record time. The
                    new American development was lavish which subsequently drew some criticism, but
                    it was done with great speed which was the essential requirement of the time.
                    This was primarily the work of Glen Wolfe who was an accomplished operator. He
                    deserves a great deal of credit for that move, not only for the its speed, but
                    the minimal disruption it created for the operations of our staff. He may not
                    have been an expert in inter-personal relationships, but he was an effective
                    executive. His monument still stands, forty years later. It was a professional
                    piece of work. There were very few people in the Department's administrative
                    area who could have done it as well. Maybe Graham Martin, but not many
                    others.</p>
                <p>Later, I was part of the team that surveyed Austria. Vienna was of course in a
                    far different situation than Germany. It was a city which was governed
                    tripartitely. It had not been devastated as had been Berlin or Frankfurt.</p>

                <p>POLLACK: It was discovered that we were still affixing photographs to documents
                    with a steam iron. In London, the file room was in the basement and the Visa
                    Office was on the first floor. The great technological achievement there was the
                    purchase of a system which permitted the officer to write on a slate and an
                    exact duplicate would show up in another room. This was an early version of the
                    fax machine. This small step forward expedited the movement of information
                    tremendously. Two State Department visa experts went to London and designed new
                    procedures and introduced small technological improvements. They speeded the
                    process up considerably, but for its first two years, the Refugee Relief Program
                    was the single biggest administrative challenge faced by the Bureau of European
                    Affairs. We had to get the consular function modernized because that is where
                    the largest number of refugees resided. It would be an interesting research
                    project for someone to study the impact of the Refugee Relief Program on the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities as Deputy Executive
                        Director in the Bureau of European Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: I was told I was the alter ego of the Executive Director—at least that
                    is the way the job was described to me by Arthur Stevens, the Executive Director
                    and others. They expected me to shield them from the daily routine decisions
                    that had to be made and bring to them only those issues that required higher
                    level attention. I was also supposed to convey to the staff what were the
                    Assistant Secretary and the Executive Director desires and expectations were. It
                    was a wide ranging job, although with Arthur Stevens and his successor, I was
                    pretty much excluded from personnel decisions. They kept that responsibility in
                    their own hands. My principal area of activity was the budget, which was handled
                    by a man the name of Harris Collins. Harris was a man with a great sense of
                    order; he could organize figures in a way that made them meaningful. He was more
                    than just an accountant; he was very effective and able.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked for a number of Assistant Secretaries. Tell me
                        about their interest in administration, if any.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>POLLACK: I would say that they relied very heavily on their Executive staffs to
                    run the administrative side of the Bureau. They would intervene in a personnel
                    decision only if it were a key position in a key post and only if their
                    intervention was called for by the Executive Director. George Perkins and
                    Livingston Merchant, the two Assistant Secretaries I worked with, were
                    substantive people essentially concerned with their relations with the Secretary
                    and the conduct of international relations with European countries. Livy
                    Merchant was interested in the management of his personal time, because we were
                    all concerned with the work load burden on the senior official in the Bureau. He
                    wondered whether his time was spent as profitably as it might be. Earlier during
                    my tenure at OPA, I had become involved briefly with time study work—the
                    Department of Agriculture had pioneered work in this area. I still had some of
                    the forms we used in OPA and I persuaded Merchant to let us conduct a test on
                    him for a three or five day period. We did; I think we did it in ten minutes
                    segments. His secretary would try to keep a record of what he did during each of
                    those periods. He discovered that he was pending much more time on the telephone
                    than he wanted to. He also found that his dictation was not well organized; he
                    dictated intermittently during the day. He made some changes in his personal
                    habits; he tried to dictate during specific longer periods of the day. He tried
                    to let others answer the phone or make calls. All over the Bureau and the
                    Department, there was a tremendous concern for the burden on the senior
                    officials, who were under work and time pressures that were worrisome. I
                    encountered this phenomenon throughout my career in the Department. I also
                    encountered that unique affinity in the Department for lawyers, who never had
                    had an opportunity to manage large organizations and who found the challenges of
                    defending multi million budgets before Congressional Committees both a new
                    experience and mystifying. They did not know how to order their affairs so they
                    could manage the volume of paper that flowed across their desks. Each day, many
                    felt compelled to read much more than they needed. George Marshall introduced
                    some concepts that Carl Humelsine implemented. Marshall would not look at a
                    paper that was longer than a page. He didn't care how narrow the margins were
                    and therefore received some ridiculous memoranda with one-quarter inch margins.
                    But he forced the Department to accept the discipline of succinct statements,
                    forcing officers to state the problem and actions required by the Secretary on
                    one page. He did not want the subordinate officers to make the decisions for
                    him, but wanted to be told very briefly what the problem was and the action
                    options. This concept later developed into the “options” approach. The
                    Department officials eventually became skilled in writing options so that only
                    the one they preferred would look reasonable. The whole question of how
                    Assistant Secretaries and other senior officials manage their workload is an
                    interesting topic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the time pressure on the senior officers, which is an
                        issue that appears frequently in our oral interviews, endemic to the
                        institution of the State Department or is it the personal problem of certain
                        officials?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>POLLACK: In part, it was an outgrowth of the fact that the Secretary has to limit
                    himself in the number of people he deals with. If he is going to deal on
                    European issues primarily with the Assistant Secretary for that Bureau, then
                    that Assistant Secretary will soon wish to know all that is going on that might
                    be raised by the Secretary. I am not sure that the nature of most other
                    Departments is the same. Most other government Departments have a variety of
                    dispersed functions. For example, although Social Security is part of HEW, the
                    Administrator does not have the same relationship to the HEW Secretary as an
                    Assistant Secretary in State has to his Secretary. It is an entirely different
                    relationship. On international affairs, there a peculiar staff relationship
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and in turn between the
                    Secretary and his Assistant Secretaries. There may be other comparable
                    situations in the government, but I don't think many. That is the major factor
                    bearing on the heavy workload of senior officials. There were people like
                    Harriman who enough personal stature, having been a Cabinet officer and an
                    independent figure, who did not feel compelled to know every detail of what was
                    happening. On the other hand, Harriman was a great executive and had a pretty
                    good idea of what was going on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: Yes, with ECA (the Economic Cooperation Administration)—later ICA( the
                    International Cooperation)—, for example. Alan Boyd and I saw each other
                    frequently. We did not have very extensive relationships with other Departments,
                    except maybe on some of the attach� programs, like Labor. There were
                    considerable tensions with ECA, which was an independent agency under the policy
                    guidance of the Secretary. They made it clear that they were not getting policy
                    guidance elsewhere. I remember raising in Merchant's staff meetings repeatedly
                    the problems that ECA was posing.</p>

                        Office. Why and what were your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>POLLACK: We had in EUR a personnel officer by the name of Sherry Dann, who was a
                    very sober individual. We had a message center in EUR headed by Frank Smiraglia.
                    There had been a classification survey which had resulted in a downgrading of
                    Frank's job. I disagreed with the conclusion. I instructed Dann to ignore the
                    finding and await further developments. Frank had a couple of kids he was
                    sending through school and needed the income. Eventually the Civil Service
                    Commission found out that the results of the classification survey had not been
                    implemented. The Department's Personnel Office decided that some action had be
                    taken in view of this “negligence”. So they issued Dann an official reprimand; I
                    decided that was unjust because he had just followed my instructions. I went to
                    see the Assistant Secretary for Administration-Controller, Zeke Carpenter, and
                    had a dispute with him on the action taken against Dann. I had Merchant's
                    backing on getting the reprimand shifted to me. The Personnel Office was
                    unwilling to do so, but Carpenter finally instructed them to give me the
                    reprimand. Dann's record was cleared. A week later, Merchant got a call from
                    Carpenter, asking for permission to speak to me. I went to see him and he
                    offered me the position as his administrative assistant.</p>
                <p>I accepted it and worked as the Assistant Secretary-Controller's assistant,
                    screening the material that was addressed to him and giving him advice on
                    administrative issues in the Department. I was more a consultant than anything
                    else. Carpenter was a warm-hearted, somewhat naive businessman from Omaha.
                    Carpenter had been told by his attorneys to keep a record; he would come in the
                    morning and dictate the events of the preceding day. I remember Frances Knight
                    coming to see him once and referring to a conversation they had had previously.
                    Carpenter then pulled out his book and corrected Knight by telling precisely
                    what his notes had said about that meeting. He was very proud of his ability to
                    do that. Ed Crouch was the Department's budget officer. Carpenter was a man of
                    great integrity, whom Loy Henderson tolerated even with his lack of background
                    in State Department. Carpenter was loyal to Henderson and made a major effort to
                    establish good relations with him. He did the same with Congressman John Rooney.
                    At one point Rooney was hospitalized and was not having any visitors. Carpenter
                    considered this for a while and then bought some flowers and took them to the
                    hospital. Rooney was delighted by the attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Carpenter, as a former businessman was very conscious of the importance of audits
                    and established an internal audit group in the Department, separate and apart
                    from the Inspection Corps. A number of useful findings were made by this new
                    group; it was all part of the sporadic efforts made to bring State Department
                    into the modern world. We did not have in existence then the formal budgetary
                    systems that were tried during the Bill Crockett's era with the reviews by top
                    staffs of the programs and budgets of the various offices, divisions and
                    bureaus. Loy Henderson was concerned at one point about language deficiencies;
                    he was especially concerned by the lack of officers being trained in Chinese,
                    which the Department was in the process of reviving. He turned to Howard Mace
                    and me on a personal; basis to see whether we couldn't find a solution to his
                    problem. We suggested an incentive program which tied promotions and language
                    skills for the first time. When Loy Henderson became concerned with the language
                    program, there was a large resurgence of interest. I think it was then that the
                    early morning language programs were instituted. That is a good illustration of
                    my thesis that people tend to do what the leadership expects.</p>
                <p>Carpenter did not concern himself with the shaping of foreign policy and what the
                    Department needed to do. It is therefore unlikely that there was much linkage
                    between the budget and the substantive objectives.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after your assignment as Executive Assistant
                        to Mr. Carpenter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: Carpenter left, but I stayed in that position and worked for Lane
                    Dwinell, who was the new Assistant Secretary-Controller. Somewhere along the
                    line, I became “The Management Officer” of the Department of State. I did that
                    for about a year, supervising a staff of three or four people. I was the only
                    one who knew about the inclusion of the word “THE” in the title of the job. I
                    had written the terms of reference for the position. I had a clear and simple
                    role: I was to look at the management of the Department from the vantage point
                    of the Secretary of State. So our office rejected all responsibility for any
                    organizational changes within Bureaus; there was another staff separate from
                    ours that assisted in such efforts. We took a look at such things as the
                    clearance procedure, which I discussed earlier; it was an effort to get sharper,
                    less compromised language to the Secretary so that he would have greater choice.
                    During this period I worked with George Newman, who was then in Office of the
                    Special Assistant for Politico-Military Affairs. The Secretary was concerned
                    with his relationships with the Pentagon; so we instituted an exchange program
                    which brought military officers to the Department and vice-versa.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Earlier I had been assigned with the President's “Commission on Management of the
                    Federal Government”, which was headed by Milton Eisenhower, the President's
                    brother. On that Commission was Nelson Rockefeller and Arthur Fleming. Arthur
                    Kimball was working for Rockefeller on this Commission. The White House had been
                    greatly concerned with the relationships between the President and the Secretary
                    of State. The White House staff saw the problem as two-fold: a) the Secretary
                    travelled a considerable amount and when the President wanted his advice, he
                    often had to take someone else's; and b) the White House staff at that time
                    played only a service role and not a leading role as the National Security
                    Council staff does today. This Commission reached the conclusion that a First
                    Secretary of the Cabinet position be established. The Secretary of State would
                    continue to be the chief negotiator and do the travelling. The First Secretary
                    would be located in the White House and would advise the President on foreign
                    affairs. This idea was discussed with Senator Jackson and his Committee by
                    Rockefeller toward the end of the Eisenhower Administration as an idea that the
                    Congress might wish to consider in the future. I went with someone else to brief
                    Secretary Dulles; he blessed the idea, but since it was so late in the life of
                    the Eisenhower Administration, it didn't go very far. But I did have an
                    opportunity to attend a meeting of the American Assembly which met at the
                    Harriman estate on the Hudson to consider the role of the Secretary of State.
                    Averell Harriman was there as well as Dean Rusk, then President of the
                    Rockefeller Foundation. Everybody was concerned with the amount of travel that
                    Dulles performed. So the Assembly recommended that the Secretary of State stay
                    home and send someone else for negotiations. Dean Rusk was one of the prime
                    advocates of that point of view. Of course, when he became Secretary, he broke
                    all previous travel records.</p>
                <p>It was the experience, however, which gave me the idea for developing the concept
                    of “The Management Officer of the Department” who could look at management
                    issues from the Secretary' s vantage. In addition to the exchange program and
                    the revision of the clearance procedures, we wrote a briefing book for the
                    incoming Secretary. Kennedy had set up transition teams, one of which was
                    headquartered in George Ball's law office. Bob Schaetzel and I went and worked
                    with that team. So the briefing book was written and it was full of good advice.
                    Included was a recommendation that the President should appoint the Secretary of
                    State and that all subordinate positions in the Department be filled by the
                    President from a list provided by the Secretary, so that when the State team was
                    put together it would be off to a running start because at least the Secretary
                    would know all of them. Kennedy of course violated that thought more than any of
                    his predecessors. As a consequence, Chester Bowles was appointed Under
                    Secretary, but it was never clear to Bowles who the real Secretary was. That led
                    me to go see Carl Humelsine in Williamsburg to discuss how the Executive
                    Secretariat could be revitalized and to see whether he might be interested in
                    consulting with us on that issue. I went to see Bowles and Rusk to discuss the
                    idea; both agreed. Humelsine was a man they had confidence in. So Carl helped us
                    out and Luke Battle, who was working with Humelsine in Williamsburg, returned to
                    the Department to become Executive Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I suspect the briefing book got lost somewhere in the Executive Secretariat or
                    was disposed of. I have a copy still. The book included ten or twelve management
                    recommendations. The development of these recommendations required the
                    participation of a lot of people, not just me or my staff. Some of the ideas in
                    the book showed up subsequently in other forms. No one can be sure what the
                    genesis of an idea really was, but the book may have contributed to some. But
                    none of the recommendations as such were adopted even though it dealt with the
                    fundamental management problems of the Department. One issue for example was the
                    tension between regional and functional bureaus. Of course, there is no way that
                    that conflict could be resolved, but you can minimize the damage that the
                    competition might make to the effective operations of the Department. You can
                    find ways to improve understanding between the factions and the differing
                    responsibilities. I probably recommend that people be moved between regional and
                    functional bureaus to improve understanding of perspectives. You may remember
                    that the Regional Bureaus went through a period when they established functional
                    positions, like policy planning staffs, information officers, intelligence
                    officers, politico-military offices, etc. Of course, some of these positions
                    eventually evaporated because either it was not seen as a requirement or because
                    the incumbent was a poor selection. What did become established were offices
                    such “Regional Affairs office” staffed by capable economists and Foreign Service
                    officers. This may have been an out-growth of the Hoover Commission. The
                    geographic-functional bureau competition is inherent in foreign policy
                    activities of the United States. That requires every functional bureau to have
                    geographic concentration because that is the foreign policy is administered. We
                    did that in the Bureau of Science and Technology. It was a constant problem of
                    how the Bureau stayed in the forefront of technology knowledge and was still
                    country-oriented. In historical perspective, in 1945, foreign economic policy
                    for the United States was focused on agriculture or commerce or finance. That
                    was handled by the domestic Departments like Agriculture, Commerce and Treasury.
                    The State Department's strength laid in its geographic expertise. After the War,
                    with the changing role of the United States, it became necessary for the
                    Department of State to become more deeply involved in functional areas,
                    particularly economic affairs and such activities as propaganda to match the
                    Soviet popularity and leadership. That was quite a change in attitude and
                    approach in the conduct of our foreign affairs. I remember Phil Trezise giving
                    formal instructions on international economics to Henry Kissinger, at the
                    latter's request. Kissinger had recognized that he was not able to hold his own
                    when it came to discussions of economic issues with Treasury or Commerce
                    officials. He approached the problem very sensibly by in effect taking a
                    graduate course in concentrated form. There was no way, for example, to isolate
                    economic policy from bilateral relations because economic policy was vital to
                    each geographic area. There is therefore no permanent solution to the
                    geographic-functional divisions; it will vary with time, circumstances,
                    personalities at al. I think the tensions between the two is healthy and can be
                    beneficial. It should not be resolved. It creates a difference of views which
                    the Secretary should have more often.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>POLLACK: It came to me, as I suggested earlier, when I heard people like Milton
                    Eisenhower, Nelson Rockefeller and Arthur Fleming discussing the position of
                    Secretary of State. These were people of great experience and considerable
                    wisdom. The Secretary had immense problems stemming from the fact that he was
                    the President's principal foreign policy advisor and also the manager of a
                    prominent Cabinet Department, which was trying to modernize, which was trying to
                    merge or at least rationalize the existence of several personnel systems in the
                    same Department, which had dispersed functions and so on. It was a major
                    management challenge. In addition, one could never overlook that everyone else
                    in the White House was trying to run foreign affairs as well. When there was a
                    media leak, it was always the Department that carried the onus, regardless where
                    the leak had come from. I knew that the problems the Department had in absorbing
                    new functions and new personnel were larger than its institutional capacity to
                    deal with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: In terms of your question, I don't think the Secretary's job has been
                    doable for a long time. The question is whether a better alternative exists.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: We did get in to see him on the proposals I mentioned earlier. Of
                    course, toward the end of the Eisenhower Administration, Dulles became ill. I
                    saw therefore Christian Herter more often. I saw him a good deal, comparatively
                    speaking, for an administrative man. I was interested in reviving the concept of
                    the use of inter-Departmental committees as vehicles for action and for the
                    discussion of nascent ideas. Herter was very interested in that concept. He had
                    viewed these committees as an opportunity for networking so that one participant
                    could call another on a first name basis. We used the same argument in support
                    of the State-Defense exchange program and in maintaining State representation in
                    the National War colleges and other military training institutions. Networking
                    was well served by these approaches.</p>

                <p>POLLACK: Bill Crockett came to me one day and asked me whether I would be
                    interested in becoming the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Personnel. Bill had
                    been the Administrative Officer in Rome, while I was in EUR and therefore we had
                    a working relationship. I accepted and became in effect the director for
                    personnel for the State Department. The only personnel decisions that I didn't
                    handle related to ambassadorial appointments. The Director General of the
                    Foreign Service during most of my tenure in Personnel was Tyler Thompson, who
                    had been my boss for a while in EUR and whom I knew well. We got along very
                    well. We worked out that division of labor. While Chester Bowles was Under
                    Secretary, there was a great deal of interest in the role of the Ambassador and
                    therefore in the selection of candidates and in the issue of political and
                    career appointments. It was therefore a very important issue which required the
                    attention of a top-level official. The division of labor was furthermore
                    compatible with the fact that the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries focused
                    much more on ambassadorial appointments than any other personnel issue. So I had
                    an agreed charter to run the total personnel program, which included the medical
                    division. The Director General spent all of his time on ambassadorial
                    appointments and the monitoring of their performance; the personnel policies and
                    programs were the responsibility of the Deputy Assistant Secretary. It is, of
                    course, completely changed now. The personnel function is part of the Director
                    General's province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major personnel issues during the almost two
                        year period during which you were Deputy Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: The problems in Personnel are pretty standard. They don't change
                    greatly. If you have an organization such as the Foreign Service, you manage
                    recruitment, training, allowances, education of children. You try to provide the
                    Service with combinations of skills and talents required, either through
                    recruitment or training. We probably were more concerned with than anything else
                    was broadening the personnel selection base. At that point, the Foreign Service
                    depended very heavily on the Ivy League schools for its source of new recruits.
                    That was the perception and in my view largely correct. It was at the Ivy League
                    that students learned foreign languages, which were stressed in the entrance
                    examination. There was color discrimination; there was religious
                    discrimination—perhaps less so in the 60s than there was in the 40s. The Foreign
                    Service did not reflect adequately the diversity of the country it served. So we
                    were interested in enlarging the recruitment base. The change may have come
                    about anyway, but I am sure we expedited the opening of the Foreign Service to
                    minorities. That was an interesting, exciting and rewarding initiative. History
                    depends on the perspective of the viewer. If you read Dean Rusk's autobiography,
                    you will see that he takes credit for that program. I have great trouble
                    recollecting that he had very much to do with it, except to let it proceed. He
                    may have felt that he had provided the guidance.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The Foreign Service had also been the subject of considerable negative comments
                    from the academic community which was playing a larger role in the Kennedy
                    Administration than it did in the Eisenhower one. The criticism concerned the
                    perception that the Foreign Service was self-managing organization, interested
                    in its own self-succession, rather than working for the welfare of the
                    Department and the country. So we placed a lot of stress on putting some visible
                    integrity on the personnel system, trying to insure that the assignment process
                    operated without favoritism in an open, above-board manner. We made a major
                    effort to bring the responsibility for assignments back into the Personnel
                    Office because if we did not have that authority, then we could not provide the
                    integrity to the system that we wanted to achieve. When I took over as Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary, much of the de facto authority rested with the regional
                    bureaus; I tried to reverse that situation and make the Personnel Office the
                    responsible decision-making authority. We developed some elaborate procedures;
                    for example, we reviewed periodically all the senior personnel in a given
                    bureau, discuss performances with the bureau leadership and reach common
                    assessments concerning individual performances. This was not done for purposes
                    of rating performance, but to assist the Personnel Office to make onward
                    assignments. In the process, we tried to take some biases out of the assignment
                    process and put it on a firmer factual basis. We resisted vigorously any efforts
                    that might be made to “save” certain positions for certain officers. I remember
                    Foy Kohler—then Assistant Secretary for EUR—, an officer for whom I had the
                    greatest respect and affection, trying to place an officer, who had a lot of
                    public affairs talent, in an Eastern European post as Deputy Chief of Mission.
                    We had reviewed the file and felt that he was just not qualified for such an
                    assignment and that we had officers with much better qualifications who should
                    be given the opportunity. Foy insisted and we had quite a protected and vigorous
                    conversation. I am not sure who the winner was, but this was an illustration of
                    the approach we took to assignments. We were very serious about our efforts.</p>
                <p>We were also very concerned about the Civil Service employees, particularly the
                    clerical staff. We developed a program which brought these people together with
                    me on a weekly basis in a no-holds barred session during which they could
                    express their views on personnel policies and practices in an unrecorded
                    meetings. I felt that this mechanism was very useful and allowed the Civil
                    Service an opportunity to let off steam and at the same time provided the
                    Personnel Office insights into the problems as perceived by their clientele.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We also put a lot of emphasis on the management of a new Foreign Service officer
                    to make sure that her or she had enough exposure to the Foreign Service and
                    vice-versa so that after a period of time, we could make a judgement whether
                    this person would succeed in the Foreign Service. We developed a comprehensive
                    and organized program under Jim McDevitt, who established a “junior officer”
                    staff. He provided a link between the new officers and the Department and
                    shepherded them through their first few years in the Foreign Service. We didn't
                    want a junior officer be tagged at the beginning as a political or consular
                    specialist and have his or her future decided that early. We consciously rotated
                    these junior officer among the various Foreign Service functions. I think that
                    effort may still be in existence today; I know it continued for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herman, you touched on two major organizational questions
                        that have been debated within the Department for years. One is the
                        assignment process. You are unique in that you have had experience both in a
                        regional bureau and in a central personnel office. In light of that, how do
                        you think a good assignment process for the Department should operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: There a lot of factors that enter into that judgement. You need to
                    develop expertise; for that you need people who acquire cultural and historical
                    understandings and language skills. There are few people capable of doing that
                    for more than one geographic region of the world. On the other hand, if you
                    leave them in that area for too long, they develop “clientitis”. Moreover, the
                    European Bureau was attractive to American Foreign Service officers and staffs
                    because the conditions of employment were more pleasant in Europe than, for
                    example, in central Africa. By keeping them in central Africa, you would be
                    denying them and their families a respite from difficult environments. On the
                    other side, if you rotated employees too often, the system would be replete with
                    people with great general skills and no knowledge in depth. It is the same
                    problem as the one that occurs when someone in the Civil Service who remains in
                    his job so long that he or she are the only ones that know where the files are
                    hidden and the “bodies” buried. There is no clear answer to the question of the
                    appropriate organizational location for the assignment responsibility. If I'd to
                    make a choice, I would side with a centralized system on the grounds that a
                    small organization such as the Foreign Service is not so large that a central
                    group can not oversee a system competently. If you are looking at the issue in
                    the Defense Department, with thousands of people, then you must have break-downs
                    by military services and their sub-specialties. That isn't required for a small
                    service such as the Foreign Service. The skills required are pretty much the
                    same wherever they are needed. So I would put the burden on a central staff, but
                    I would require that the process be conducted be managed in an uncontentious
                    manner, in a partnership effort and by people whose personalities and background
                    were such that they could manage the process with due care for those regional
                    managers whose responsibilities were to staff a post adequately to perform the
                    tasks it was called to perform by their superiors and world circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that “skills were interchangeable”. Based on
                        your experiences in the Office of Science and Technology, where do you stand
                        on the question of “generalists versus specialists”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: Right square in the middle. I wrote a superb memorandum on that issue
                    which said that the necessity for having specialists in science is as great as
                    it was having specialists in Soviet or Latin American affairs. I said that we
                    needed the ability to merge knowledge of foreign policy, the geographic aspects,
                    the technical knowledge of issues of interest to the Department, such as nuclear
                    energy, space, environment, etc. Therefore there should be an understanding
                    between our Office and the central Personnel office which should put an end to
                    the continuing bureaucratic battles that ensued every time our Office tried to
                    recruit some specialist from the outside. Invariably, when we had a vacancy, the
                    Personnel Office would have available a Foreign Service Officer for whom they
                    had not found an assignment and therefore wanted to place that officer in a
                    functional bureau and in our case particularly SCI. I recommended a 50/50 split
                    between scientists and general Foreign Service Officers. I chose that ration,
                    not on any scientific basis, but because I thought it was politically
                    negotiable; if I had recommended a 60/40 split, which I thought would be more
                    appropriate, I probably would not have gotten it. We culled the Foreign Service
                    with great care to see if we could find any scientifically or technically
                    trained people. There were a few, but none who were willing to return to their
                    collegiate “roots”; they had moved beyond that. For example, there might have
                    been chemists who had entered the Foreign Service and that did their best to
                    forget everything they had ever learned on the subject because that was no
                    future in the Foreign Service through chemistry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then the answer for the need of specialists, if I
                        understand you correctly, is to employ them from outside the Department of
                        State for a given period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: I would not put a limit on the time. You have to make it possible for
                    potential employees to feel secure in working for NIH (National Institute of
                    Health) or the National Bureau of Standards. They could not feel, that after
                    having served abroad for a tour of duty, they would be job hunting again. They'd
                    to have some feeling of security. That was a major short-coming of the FSRU
                    (Foreign Service Reserve-Unlimited) concept, which surfaced periodically during
                    my time in the Department. The point is that you can not deal with nuclear
                    energy unless you understand something about the nature of a reactor, why
                    nuclear energy may be important, what can be done with nuclear energy besides
                    producing energy. It is important for a scientific attach� to understand matters
                    of this nature. Otherwise, he has nothing to offer. That knowledge is not
                    available everywhere. I can give you many illustrations to support that
                    view.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Once you accepted the Hoover Commission concept that “ war is no longer to be
                    left to the generals, nor foreign affairs to the State Department”—that is the
                    concept that foreign and domestic affairs are just different points on the same
                    spectrum—than you have to have the ability to hold your own in dealing with
                    domestic scientific agencies which have a deep technical capacity. It is vital
                    for the Department to have some specialist knowledge in the scientific and
                    technical fields. For example, there was a project called “Storm Fury” which was
                    an effort to control or moderate hurricanes in the Caribbean. There extensive
                    cloud seeding programs taking place. No one was sure what the results of seeding
                    might be; whether it intensified the hurricane, moderated it or changed its
                    direction. When the Caribbean countries began to understand the uncertainties
                    involved in the experiment, the political unease about this program being
                    conducted above their countries grew. So we moved the experiment to the Pacific
                    where typhoons are identical to hurricanes. The nature of the Pacific typhoons
                    are such that Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan become excellent bases for
                    experiments. I don't remember fully what the scientists who were running the
                    program were stating, but they were very insistent that they wanted to have a
                    base in one of the three countries. If it had been Japan, the Japanese would
                    have objected vigorously because they had a great fear of natural disasters. We
                    reviewed the analysis and found that the demand by the scientists was based on
                    their analysis that the number of typhoons that would come to Japan was just a
                    modest percentage higher than if they could have based their experiments at
                    another site. The entire program could have been effective even if it weren't
                    based in Japan. As soon as we understood that, the political programs
                    disappeared because we could choose a base which didn't raise any political
                    problems. I have encountered the same problems in remote sensing experiments
                    from satellites; the scientists' needs can be met without raising political
                    problems if the Department can make a scientific or technical analysis.</p>
                <p>The Department's needs for specialists was already evident when I was Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Personnel in the early 60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in charge of Personnel, what conclusions did
                        you reach about the relationships in the State Department between the Civil
                        Service and the Foreign Service? Could one institution operate with two
                        different personnel systems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>POLLACK: No. That was a very unpopular conclusion that I reached when I was in
                    Personnel. One system had been for very good historical reasons been
                    administered by the Department of State almost autonomously. The other system
                    was government-wide managed at a very high level of generality designed to
                    accommodate a wide spectrum of a large number of employees which included a
                    great range of skills from messenger to top level administrators. The Foreign
                    Service had a much narrower focus, was more restricted in its range of
                    activities. It had problems that once upon a time were unique, but did become
                    somewhat more general when domestic agencies began to assigning personnel
                    abroad. I concluded that to find a way to administer these two disparate systems
                    in a single Department, as small as State was, provided much more complexity
                    than benefits. I thought we needed a system that would enable a Foreign Service
                    Officer, if there were compelling reasons, to remain in one place for twenty
                    years, if that was beneficial to the U.S. Government. I also thought that if
                    there were a Civil Service official who would be useful at some overseas post,
                    the Department would have the authority to move such an official. Therefore, I
                    had in mind a system that would depend less on rules and regulations and more on
                    skilled an sensitive administrators who would be granted wide latitude in the
                    assignment of personnel, with due regard to the preferences of the individuals,
                    some of whom prefer to move and some who didn't. The administrators would also
                    take into account the preferences of those who wished to become specialists with
                    deep knowledge of one or two subjects, while others might prefer to remain
                    generalists who had over-whelming ambitions to become Ambassadors. There were
                    some who didn't necessarily see such an assignment as the acme of their careers.
                    Therefore, I supported a single system to be used in the Department of State
                    into which people could move in and out as they preferred. At the core of such
                    system, would have been a corps very much like the Foreign Service, but would
                    greater flexibility to accommodate the many personal situations that had to be
                    taken into account.</p>

                <p>POLLACK: Something akin to it arose later when an another effort was made to
                    revise the Foreign Service personnel system. This new attempt was concentrated
                    on the concept of a unified Foreign Service. It ran into great opposition from
                    within the Department, some form the Civil Service Commission and others who did
                    not want to lose their ability to have a say in the Department's personnel
                    policies and practices. The problem of the Foreign and Civil Services and the
                    fundamental philosophies that underlie each have been a recurring theme in the
                    history of the Department and a perpetual burden to the personnel managers of
                    the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Beyond that, of course, you also have a clash between the foreign service
                    personnel systems of other agencies with representation abroad. During the early
                    60s, a considerable effort was made to bring uniformity to the overseas
                    personnel systems of the Department, the United States Information Agency and
                    the International Cooperation Administration (now the Agency for International
                    Development). We had many committees trying to bring some conformity to the
                    three disparate systems; we communicated among each other in order to minimize
                    the difference in treatment that the personnel of each of those agencies
                    received. We tried to provide comparability and uniformity of policy and
                    treatment so that personnel serving at the same post would not receiving
                    differing perquisites.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your tour as Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                        Personnel, you attended the National War College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: That's correct. That assignment was made because I had roused
                    Congressman John Rooney's displeasure, who had heard that I was trying to
                    succeed Bill Crockett. There was of course no truth to that, but Rooney mandated
                    that I be removed from the personnel job and therefore I went to the National
                    War College. I am forever grateful to Rooney for that assignment. It was
                    great.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>When I returned from my “academic” year in 1964, I worked for Crockett again as a
                    special assistant. I remember telling Crockett that I had always been concerned
                    by the problem that although the Department had always been expected to be the
                    leader and coordinator of foreign affairs within the government, it didn't have
                    any philosophy of leadership. I had encountered at the National War College a
                    very well considered and articulated concept of leadership in the military
                    services. So I asked Bill whether I could prepare a memorandum on the subject,
                    which must still be in someone's archives in the Department. I focused on
                    inter-departmental leadership. I was concerned about the ability of the
                    Department to undertake in a non-bureaucratic mode, the functions of molding our
                    country's foreign policy so that the requirements as seen by the Department and
                    those viewed by the domestic agencies could be reconciled and synthesized. There
                    is a natural tendency in the Department to look at the foreign affairs efforts
                    of other agencies as an invasion of prerogatives. I was trying to develop a
                    concept that increase the Department's awareness of this issue. There is a
                    tremendous institutional lag that effects all agencies and particularly the
                    Department of State. In the 60s, we had people who had been molded in the
                    pre-War days or in the days immediately following the War by the philosophy that
                    foreign affairs was the prerogative of the Department of State; that
                    agricultural policy was the purview of the Department of Agriculture which
                    should stick to that business and not get involved in foreign affairs. I was
                    looking for a way to institutionalize a concept that leadership requires an
                    understanding of the points of views and problems of other bureaucracies.
                    Leadership required an understanding of where the other bureaucracies were
                    coming from and needed to accommodate those perspectives to the objectives that
                    the Department of State was trying to achieve, which essentially focused on the
                    political relationships with country or a region. It was quite clear that after
                    World War II, the distinction between foreign and agricultural policies had
                    greatly diminished. That was a major finding of the Hoover Commission.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>There was nothing in the Department's personnel development program that would
                    give its officers a concept of what leadership was; what it entailed; what the
                    price was; etc. I was trying to break fresh ground on that issue. Leadership was
                    essentially an effort to bring proposals to the President that took into account
                    the legitimate concerns of the domestic agencies. It also entailed the
                    elimination or at least diminution of the political trading that occurs normally
                    in a the resolution of a multi-agency problem. When I had the management job, I
                    was assigned to take a look at the Science office because a complaint had been
                    registered with Under Secretary for Political Affairs Bob Murphy. The Science
                    Advisor's position had been re-established on the heel of the Soviet Sputnik
                    when the whole U.S. Government restructured its scientific efforts, from the
                    White House's Science Advisor to all the large agencies. I found that the
                    Department's Science Office consisted of a number of competent, lost souls who
                    had no idea how they might make an impact on the Department's policy-making
                    process. So they commiserated largely among themselves and other scientists
                    outside the Department, thereby inadvertently doing damage to the Department's
                    reputation. The perception grew that the Department was not taking science and
                    the development of international science and technology very seriously. It was.
                    of course, a true perception. My recommendations after the quick survey resulted
                    in the appointment of Earl Sohm as the Science Advisor, based on the argument
                    that the Office needed someone who could bring to it an understanding of the
                    rest of the Department and who could communicate the scientists' concerns to the
                    rest of the Department. The science effort was a functional activity that was
                    the most removed from the center of foreign affairs, as understood by the
                    Department of State. Earl took the job and was still in it when I returned to
                    the Department from the National War College. He had been in it long enough so
                    that he was eligible for re-assignment and so it was offered to me. I was
                    delighted. I knew that my first function would be to recruit a Science Advisor
                    because Ed Kretzmann, who had been acting Science Advisor, was about to retire.
                    We over-lapped a couple of months. I undertook the recruitment effort; the men I
                    identified from the scientific community—whose names I got from places like the
                    White House, NASA, etc—I took to Dean Rusk and George Ball for their review.
                    Some were brought in for interviews and raised conditions which were
                    incompatible with the way the Secretary viewed his role in making assignments.
                    The candidates were looking for clear statements of authority that would
                    overcome some of the ambiguities that exist when you have both regional and
                    functional offices in the same institution. There were bound to be overlapping
                    jurisdictions and the science candidates wanted clarity. The Secretary viewed
                    himself as an expert in both science and foreign affairs because while head of
                    the Rockefeller Foundation he had dealt widely with both worlds. He had a good
                    appreciation of the inter-relationship between the two. He also had a good sense
                    of the impossibility of bringing in an official into the Department and then
                    trying to fence off his responsibilities from those of every one else's. He
                    understood that there had to be an over-lap between geography and function. So
                    he would tell the candidate that he couldn't have a clear mandate; the next one
                    would come in with the same results. The third and fourth candidates of course
                    couldn't accept anything less that the clear mandate because by his time it was
                    pretty well known in the scientific leadership community what had happened to
                    the first two candidates. That community was rather small and saw each other
                    frequently because they all tended to sit on the same panels, such as the
                    President's Scientific Advisory Council. How could one good man take on a job
                    that an other good man had turned down? The recruitment process went on for
                    sometime and we failed to recruit a number of top notch people. So I stayed in
                    the job because the Department couldn't recruit a first class broad-gauged
                    scientist. By this time, the Office of the Science Advisor had been assigned the
                    responsibility for negotiating nuclear and space agreements. So the Office's
                    title was changed to the Office for International Scientific Affairs. My
                    greatest asset was my knowledge of how the bureaucracy functioned. So I got
                    larger and better space; I insisted on a rug on the floor because that was a
                    status symbol which put the office in its proper level in the power ladder; I
                    raised the Office to a Bureau also a status symbol. I was trying to impress on
                    people both inside and outside the Department, the importance of science to
                    foreign affairs. I was authorized to employ a scientist as my deputy. All of
                    this happened in 1965. When it was agreed that I would be appointed as Bureau
                    chief—it was not at that time a statutory position—, largely out of concern for
                    the Department's image with other agencies, I suggested to Foy Kohler, who was
                    then the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, that I should be sworn in. The
                    swearing-in ceremony was in some respects a sham because normally those are held
                    only for Presidential appointees. But it was useful, as I said, to invite
                    representatives of other agencies so that they could see that the Department
                    took the function seriously. I insisted that the Secretary perform the ceremony
                    and that all the attributes of a regular ceremony be followed. So the ceremony
                    took place; my family was there; I signed some fake protocol papers—that is,
                    these papers were not the usual Presidential papers, but they did appoint me to
                    the position of Director of the Bureau for International Scientific Affairs
                    (later, the word “Technological” was added). Invited to the ceremony were the
                    members of the House of Representatives' Science Advisory panel, which was
                    composed of the cream of the U.S. scientific community. Also present was Nobel
                    Prize winner Vargas from Brazil. It was a very impressive ceremony and achieved
                    the results I wanted; i.e. Departmental attention to the science function. The
                    attach�s and the other agencies were impressed by what they had seen or read
                    about the ceremony and the Secretary's words. We played a lot of games like
                    that. We re-instituted the Secretary's lunches for scientists so that there
                    could be better communication between them and the Department. We had Nobel
                    Prize winners attend these functions which were held five or six times each
                    year. They seldom got a chance to eat because they were so busy talking to the
                    Secretary and his senior staff. It became very popular and my problem was to
                    hold the number of senior staff members down to the numbers of available chairs.
                    We used to talk about computers at the lunches. IBM used to have a little
                    theater across from the original location of the International Club. It was part
                    of its program to sell computers to the U.S. government and the Congress. The
                    theater was used to put on a little show explaining what a computer could do. I
                    remember that I arranged a briefing limited to Deputy Assistant Secretaries and
                    above; I tried to limit attendance to the policy leadership. We took them to the
                    theater for the show. I tried hard to get IBM to modify the conclusion of the
                    presentation so that it would have some pertinence to the State Department. IBM
                    said that their presenters were members of Actors Equity and couldn't really
                    make the transition. The show consisted of a toy railroad layout, with a series
                    of tracks leading to sheds. They went through the explanation that it was
                    through such a devise that essentially a computer would be able to segregate
                    Scottish women with red hair and blue eyes of a certain age. Each rail crossing
                    would be a segregation point where at the turn of a switch all redheads would go
                    on one rail and all others on another. It was a very effective explanation of
                    the binary system. At the end, the comments were: “Is that what it is all about?
                    is that what the Soviet Union is trying to acquire?”. It took a while for them
                    to comprehend that the Soviets weren't interested in the number of red-headed
                    Scottish women, but would find a computer useful for missile design.
                    Nevertheless, it was an impressive example of the lack of scientific and
                    technological understanding of the top leadership of the Department in the early
                    60s. These were people in their late 40s and 50s, who were educated before,
                    during or shortly after World War II, long before the modern scientific
                    era—before computers, before jets, etc. Once they got into the government
                    rat-race, there was no way they could keep up. There was no way to provide them
                    with an adequate understanding of modern technology. It was a real problem in
                    the Department of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The fact is that you can no longer isolate the political actions of countries
                    from the motivations which are no longer bound by geographic lines. National
                    strengths today are more likely to be judged by economic, scientific and
                    technological factors to a far greater degree than ever before. A country desk
                    officer has to be a very unusual breed to understand this much more complex set
                    of realities. Some thought might well be given to educational programs that can
                    develop this unusual breed. The officer has to able to understand what motivates
                    the French in nuclear energy, in the space program, etc. He can't leave to NASA
                    and DOE the responsibility of dealing with the French. If that happens, then the
                    desk officer is ill equipped to deal with the French on political matters
                    because all the new strains are intertwined with the old forces.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in State Department for twenty-eight years. In
                        retrospect, how would you summarize that period of your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POLLACK: Very rewarding. Very interesting. I would not have traded it for
                    anything else that I might have been able to do. I did pay a high price in that
                    my family grew up without me. The State Department has come a long way. Anyone
                    who entered the Department during and after the early 50s missed out on how
                    backward the Department was in earlier periods. It has become much more
                    sophisticated. The leadership has a far better comprehension of the
                    non-political factors that now determine foreign policy. What is not yet
                    completely understood yet is the degree to which the U.S. economy is a part of a
                    global economy and the significance and implication of that new development. To
                    the extent that the Hoover Commission thought that foreign and domestic policy
                    were one is now imbedded in concrete, far beyond what anyone in the early 50s
                    would have predicted. The two can no longer be separated.</p>
                <p>If you think seriously about the Department, you would have to concentrate on the
                    mix of personnel that modern diplomacy requires and the new inter-agency
                    mechanisms that a President might wish to establish so that if the Department is
                    not adequately responsive to his or her needs, the response could come from
                    another part of the U.S. government. The biggest problem in getting a response
                    elsewhere is illustrated by the hurricane story I mentioned earlier. Other
                    agencies can not be expected to understand the potential ramification of their
                    single-minded pursuits of their objectives on the bilateral relationships
                    between the United States and other countries. State, on the other hand, should
                    be able to understand the motivation of other agencies as well as the realities
                    of the world political scene. It is State that should be able to judge whether
                    the domestic agency has a requirement that must be accommodated; whether it must
                    be accommodated in the way preferred by the domestic agencies; and whether such
                    accommodation is worth the political and economic price that might have to be
                    paid.</p>

                        leadership memorandum you wrote in the early 60s may be even more pertinent
                        now than it was then.</hi>

                <p>POLLACK: I read it again very recently. It reads as if had been written
                    yesterday. When I left the personnel job in 1963, my read to my staff what I
                    said then was my legacy. I described the problems as I saw them and what I
                    thought needed to be done by my successors. I asked the staff whether it had any
                    reaction; they all agreed with my conclusions. What in fact I read to them, was
                    a memorandum that a consultant had written in 1948. I think that is a fitting
                    close to this interview.</p>

                        Oral History program for the time you have given us. It has been a very
